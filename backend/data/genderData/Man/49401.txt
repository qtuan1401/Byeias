’  ’ ’   (Reuters)   Two people were killed and four wounded when gunfire   erupted on Thursday at a park crowded with people gathered for a   football tournament in Louisville, Kentucky, a police spokesman   told reporters. ’ ’   Police did not have a motive for the two related shootings in   Shawnee Park or suspects in custody, spokesman Dwight Mitchell   said. ’ ’   Two men were dead at the scene, and the wounded suffered      injuries, he said. ’ ’   ”When you have a tragedy like this take place, certainly it puts   a damper on anyone celebrating” the Thanksgiving holiday,   Mitchell said. ’ ’   The shootings took place as hundreds of people gathered in the   park along the Ohio River for the annual Juice Bowl Football   Tournament, a tradition dating back to the 1950s. ’ ’   (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Sandra Maler and Chris   Reese) ’
