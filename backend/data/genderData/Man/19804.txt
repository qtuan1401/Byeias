Former Vice President Al Gore is responding to reports that hadn’t endorsed Hillary Clinton yet. [“I am not able to attend this year’s Democratic convention,” Gore said in a statement. “But I will be voting for Hillary Clinton. ”  Gore cited Clinton’s experience as a reason he supported her, but also praised her for recognizing the dangers of global warming. He also seemed to be responding to questions about his loyalty to the Clinton family. “Given her qualifications and experience  —   and given the significant challenges facing our nation and the world, including, especially, the global climate crisis, I encourage everyone else to do the same,” he said, after revealing his decision to vote for Clinton.
