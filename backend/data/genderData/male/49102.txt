’  ’ ’   (Reuters)   General Electric Co is nearing an about $30 billion   deal to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc.   the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. ’ ’   The combined entity will be controlled by GE and would have   publicly traded shares,  citing   people familiar with the matter. ’ ’   The deal is to be announced on Monday, the Journal said. ’ ’   GE said in a statement last week that it was in talks with the   oilfield services provider on potential partnerships but none of   those options included an outright purchase. ’ ”   Baker Hughes’ planned merger with bigger rival Halliburton Co.    fell through in May due to opposition from regulators. ” ’’ ’   A partnership with Baker Hughes could help GE to transform its   oil and gas division and emerge a larger player in the sector to   better compete with oilfield services leader Schlumberger. ’ ’   Also, this partnership could give Baker Hughes a chance to   redefine itself following the failed merger.  ’ ’ (Reporting by Vishal Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by   Gopakumar Warrier) ’
