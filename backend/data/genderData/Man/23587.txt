Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while commenting on Wikileaks releasing 20, 000 emails stolen from the servers of the Democratic National Committee which show a bias towards the campaign of Hillary Clinton, former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) should resign that post.  Sanders said, “I asked and demanded Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s resignation many, many months ago and I state that again. I don’t think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC. Not only for these awful emails which revealed the prejudice of the DNC, but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people and I don’t think her leadership style is doing that. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
