FBI notes handed over to Congress this week reveal that Hillary Clinton told investigators that one of her Republican predecessors as Secretary of State, Colin Powell, advised her to use a personal email account. Powell soon issued a statement that he could recall no such conversation. [The New York Times reports that Clinton’s evidently false statement came during the     hour interview she gave FBI agents in early July.  It looks as if Clinton was trying to repurpose a dinner conversation she had with Powell, and other former Secretaries of State, well after she had already decided to set up her secret email server: The officials, though, didn’t seem so concerned about the safeguarding of classified information when it was housed on a private server owned by their boss, Clinton. Indeed, Palmieri denied it even existed. “Hillary didn’t send any classified materials over email: Hillary only used her personal account for unclassified email,” Palmieri claimed in a blog post more than a year ago. ClintonWorld doesn’t seem confident that the public will agree with the FBI’s strange decision to let Mrs. Clinton skate because she didn’t “intend” to commit gross negligence. A   warning to all readers: do not, under any circumstances, believe that you will be able to peddle imaginary conversations to FBI agents without consequence. As with much of what the Clintons have done, this is a special privilege available only to political royalty with the right Party credentials.
