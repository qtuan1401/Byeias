Former New Mexico governor and likely Libertarian Party presidential candidate laughed when he heard the report billionaire David Koch planned to spend millions to help him in 2016.  “We have no knowledge of it. None whatsoever. You just got to laugh,” Johnson told CBS News on Thursday. Charles and David Koch are staunchly opposed to presumptive Republican nominee, with Charles going so far as to say it’s “possible” electing Hillary Clinton is preferable. The Kochs budgeted $889 million for the 2016 election but have so far focused on   races.
