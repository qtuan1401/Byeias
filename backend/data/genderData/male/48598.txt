’  ’ ’   The NBA is a constantly evolving league. ’ ’   20 years ago, teams frequently played slow,      offense, with fewer   and more physical defense.   Now, many teams play small, fast, spaced out offenses, focusing   on    and  . ’ ’   In ten years, however, the NBA could look completely different,   at least according to Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens. Stevens,   who runs a     Celtics team, was on   ”The Ringer NBA Show” with Bill Simmons and asked what the league   may look like down the road. Stevens explained that he believes   the NBA is dictated by its best players and their skills, meaning   teams have to adjust to their toughest competition. ’ ’   ”I think the game will always be dependent on the players that   are at its most elite level at that time,” Stevens said. He   continued: ’ ’’ ’   Stevens did note that he finds speed wins over the course of a   game and that the math behind taking more   is   difficult to dispute. ’ ”   However, as he and Simmons discussed, the league is currently at   a point where there are so many skilled   and   shooters that teams frequently have to adjust to this style in   order to keep up. In comparison to the ’90s, when the league was   dominated by big men like Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing, and   Shaquille O’Neal, teams now must employ players who can spread   the floor, handle the ball, and defend multiple positions. ” ’   ”Inevitably, everybody will be forced to play a little bit   differently if multiple great   players are back in the   game,” Stevens said before noting that many kids don’’t grow up   learning to play in the post much anymore. ’ ’   Much in the same way that Stephen Curry has become a     force, it may only take one or two great big men to   make the NBA reverse course. ’
