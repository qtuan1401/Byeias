Joining the woman who sued McDonald’s for serving coffee that was “too hot,” a trio of customers have decided to sue Chipotle for making the burritos “too full. ”[The Mexican food outlet recently introduced a new burrito with a different meat choice and other fixings to bring down the total calories of the meal. But three customers from Los Angeles were still upset that the meal was too filling.  According to court documents, one of the customers insisted he “felt excessively full and realized that the burrito couldn’t have been just 300 calories,” CBS Pittsburgh reported. This suit joins such cases as the McCoffee suit filed by Stella Liebeck, who apparently did not expect her coffee to be hot, as well as the suit taking Subway sandwiches to task for not being 12 inches long. Then there was the lawsuit against the White Castle hamburger chain because a customer thought their booths were too small. Add those complaints to the obese man who sued practically everyone, claiming that fast food made him fat. Furthermore, there was the man who sued McDonald’s because he did not get enough napkins with his quarter pounder meal.
