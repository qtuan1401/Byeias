While speaking Monday at a Democratic rally in Flint, MI, former president Bill Clinton criticized ObamaCare, calling it “the craziest thing in the world. ”  “So you’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It’s the craziest thing in the world,” the husband of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said. (  CNN) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
