Reports from NBC News suggest that the wife of Orlando jihadist Omar Mateen, Noor Zahi Salman, knew of Mateen’s plot to attack the Pulse night club, and went with him on several occasions to scope out potential terror targets. [“Orlando gunman Omar Mateen’s wife, Noor Salman, has told the FBI that she drove Mateen to the Pulse nightclub on a prior occasion but that she tried to talk him out of the attack, officials told NBC News,” NBC News reported on Tuesday. “Several officials familiar with what she has told the FBI said she was with him when he bought ammunition and a holster. She also once drove him to the nightclub because he wanted to see it in advance, the officials said. ”  As reported by Breitbart News yesterday, Salman went with Mateen and their    son to Disney World back in April, seeking to find more information regarding the potential ease of executing a terrorist attack there in the name of the Islamic State. She also went with him to Pulse, where Mateen killed at least 49 and injured another 50, some of whom remain in critical condition. “Law enforcement officials said authorities are considering filing criminal charges against Salman for failing to tell them what she knew before the attack, but no decision has been made,” NBC News reported. They say, for now, Salman is cooperating with the investigation.
