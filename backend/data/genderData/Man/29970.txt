Thursday night on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360,” as part of her   commentary Republican strategist Ana Navarro said Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) was attempting to win over the evangelical votes to the point that it “was all he could do but start speaking in tongues. ”  Navarro said, “He’s very intense, but that is his personalty. Marco is a guy that’s got a lot of nervous energy. You sit next to him he is always fidgeting. His leg is going up and down. That is just who it is. But he’s not only trying to take votes from Jeb Bush, he’s also squarely going after the evangelical votes. It was all he could do but start speaking in tongues today. You know when he got asked the question about the savoir he turned it into a faith question. He got asked a question about his attacks on Chris Christie, and all of a sudden it turned into a beautifully rehearsed poetic answer on faith. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
