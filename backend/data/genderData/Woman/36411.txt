 (CNN) A restored Tudor warship, originally launched during the reign of Henry VIII, is about to be unveiled in Portsmouth, UK following a £5. 4 million revamp. The Mary Rose was discovered in 1971, raised in 1982 and has since undergone 34 years of conservation work. The warship first went on display at the Mary Rose Museum in 2013, enclosed in a special conservation box with small viewing windows, which prevented the public from seeing the full ship.  After more restoration work began in November, conservationists removed some of the walls to provide panoramic views of the ship from nine galleries through    glazing on the lower and main decks. The results of their hard work will be visible to the public from Wednesday.  The ship, originally built as part of Henry VIII’s plan to expand his ”army by sea” was first launched in 1511. It sank during the Battle of the Solent in 1545 although it is still not exactly clear why. Many of the ship’s crew died when she went down.

After the ship was raised, its hull was first sprayed with a mist of fresh chilled water and then with a   wax from 1994 to April 2013, before the   process began. The whole restoration project cost £39 million.
