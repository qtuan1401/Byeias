Maine Gov. Paul LePage said Thursday that he doesn’t believe Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) is eligible to become president. [From the Huffington Post: LePage told radio host Howie Carr that his two daughters were born in Canada, and they had to be naturalized as U. S. citizens even though he was born in America. “So I have a question there,” LePage said. Cruz was also born in Canada, but he maintains that he fits the constitutional requirement that a president be a “natural born citizen” because his mother was born in America. LePage said he didn’t think Cruz could be president because he believed his daughters were also ineligible. “They can’t. I know they can’t. I’ve already looked into it,” he said.
