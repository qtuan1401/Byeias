Virtually synonymous   white nationalism in many parts of country.  —   Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates) January 13, 2017,  Of course, many of the    author’s 160, 000 social media followers (and presumably some Christians) took umbrage at the suggestion that their faith automatically makes them a white nationalist. @JoyceCarolOates so all those Yazidis massacred in Syria.
