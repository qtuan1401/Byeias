’  ’ ’   Former President Bill Clinton engaged with a protester at a   Tuesday rally who accused Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton of   sending ”millions of my people to prison.” ’ ’   ”I will not vote for a candidate that sent millions of my people   to prison,” the protester, Ryant Taylor, said during the former   president’’s speech. Taylor, a local activist who is going by the   name Prince Shakur, was identified as the protester  the student publication at Ohio University. ’ ’   Taylor was referencing the former president’’s landmark 1994   criminal justice legislation, which Hillary Clinton has since   apologized for. She was not in a position to vote for it at the   time. In a similar vein, she has also been criticized for a   controversial comment she made two years later about   ”superpredators,” which she has also apologized for. ’ ’   ”Wait, wait, wait,” Bill Clinton said when the crowd at the   Athens, Ohio, rally responded by chanting ”Hillary, Hillary,   Hillary.” ’ ’   ”I agree, if I had sent millions of your people to prison, or she   had, that wouldn’’t be good,” he said. ”Hillary didn’’t vote for   the ’’94 crime bill, even though Sen. [Bernie] Sanders did.” ’ ’   He told the crowd of mostly college students that ”neither one of   them” was attempting to ”send millions of your people to prison.” ’ ’   ”Because fewer than 10% of our prison population is in the   federal prison system,” he said. ”And she was the first person in   this campaign who said we ought to do something to change the   incarceration policies. No one else has done that.” ’ ’ ’
