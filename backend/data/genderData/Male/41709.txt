 (CNN) An alleged prostitute accused in the death of a Google executive pleaded guilty on Tuesday, and was sentenced to six years in prison. Alix Tichelman faced a series of charges in the death of Forrest Timothy Hayes, 51. The married father of five was found dead in November 2013 aboard his   yacht in California’s Santa Cruz harbor. Authorities say Tichelman gave Hayes an injection of heroin and then, as he began to die, she sipped her wine, gathered her belongings, and calmly walked away. She pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, administering a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance, destroying or concealing evidence, and engaging and agreeing to engage in prostitution, according to the Santa Cruz Superior Court. Tichelman had initially pleaded not guilty to voluntary manslaughter. ”We’ve always said the case actually is an involuntary manslaughter (case)    that it was an accidental overdose and a subsequent panic and a failure to call 911,” said Gerald Christensen, her lawyer. ”I think she has tremendous amount of relief that this ordeal is closing.”
