’  ’ ’   Uber’’s star engineer Anthony Levandowski was ”enticed” to copy   valuable technology from Google and is now involved in a ”cover   up” to hide a device based on that technology, according to a new   legal filing by Google’’s   car unit Waymo. ’ ’   The device in question is a Lidar unit, the radar sensor that     cars use to map their surroundings.  ’ ”   Uber allowed Waymo to inspect two Lidar devices after it  for allegedly stealing   Waymo’s Lidar design.  ” ’   But Waymo now says there is an entirely different version of the   device that Uber is hiding somewhere.  ’ ’   In a court filing on Friday, Waymo claims that it found evidence   that Uber has ”misrepresented” its Lidar designs to the court   after it deposed several Uber engineers who admitted to having a   second prototype.
