’  ’ ’   ”Star War” sets are notoriously secret  —   so much so that Daisy   Ridley has had to watch what she posts on social media. ’ ’   ”The Force Awakens” actress and star of the upcoming ”Episode   VIII” shares parts her life with fans on her  and commonly posts are her   #FitnessFriday videos. ’ ”   She posted a #WorkoutWednesday post July 6, because she wasn’t   sure she’d have time to squeeze in a gym visit on Friday, but   this video was slightly different than the rest. ” ’   While working out, Ridley wore a pillowcase on her head to shield   her Rey hairstyle from fans. ’ ’   ”Ran to the gym between different set ups so wore a pillowcase on   my head to protect my REY HAIRSTYLE from Instagram’’s gaze,” she   captioned the video with a smirk. ’ ’   Why can’’t she show us Rey’’s hairstyle? What’’s so different about   it in ”Episode VIII?” Is it all just a ploy to mess with ”Star   Wars” fans? We can’’t say for certain, but she did call herself a   ”top employee” and ”secrecy queen.” ’ ’ ’ ”   Even though she can’t reveal too much from filming, she did   post a photo of a beautiful set location. ” ”   Now, we just have to wait 18 months for the film’s planned   release  —   or at least until a trailer gives us a glimpse. ” ’ ’
