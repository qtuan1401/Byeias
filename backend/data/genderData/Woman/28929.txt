HBO’s “Real Time” host Bill Maher wondered if, in light of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe, “Europe will have a little more sympathy for what Israel goes through” instead of being “real a**holes” to them on Friday.  Maher said, “Europe has been real a**holes, about Israel. I mean, in general, the UN, as of 2015, the United Nations rights council had issued more official condemnations of Israel than the rest of the world’s nations combined. I wonder now, that Europe has been attacked four times, I think, now, in little over a year, and they say ISIS has 400 fighters that they’re ready to introduce back into Europe, and they’re trying to get a dirty bomb, maybe Europe will have a little more sympathy for what Israel goes through. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
