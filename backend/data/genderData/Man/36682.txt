Seoul, South Korea (CNN) North Korea fired two ballistic missiles Wednesday morning    including one into the Sea of Japan    in the country’s latest defiance of U. N. Security Council resolutions, U. S. and South Korean authorities said. The missiles, presumed to be No Dong, or Rodong, intermediate range ballistic ones, were fired simultaneously from the country’s west, the U. S. Strategic Command said.  One exploded after launch, the Strategic Command said. The other flew about 621 miles (1, 000 kilometers) over North Korea and into the Sea of Japan, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The firing drew international condemnation. Japan said the   missile landed about 155 miles (250 kilometers) west of the Oga Peninsula inside its exclusive economic zone    an area of the sea where a country claims maritime rights to resources such as fish, oil and gas.
