BROWNSVILLE, Texas  —   A U. S. Congressman from Texas demands the immediate extradition of Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman Loera and two former Mexican governors who are currently wanted by the U. S. Department of Justice. [Soon after Guzman’s capture was announced, Filemon Vela came out with a dire warning about Mexico’s next steps.   Yarrington and Hernandez have both been accused of laundering cartel bribes from Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Yarrington has also been charged with drug conspiracy charges in connection with the Gulf cartel, the Los Zetas cartel and the Beltran Leyva cartel, Breitbart Texas previously reported. Despite being fugitives in the United States, both Yarrington and Hernandez continue to live in Mexico and make routine appearances in public. Most recently Hernandez was a guest of honor when current Tamaulipas governor Egidio Torres Cantu gave his yearly state address, Breitbart Texas reported.  While addressing Guzman’s capture, Vela continued to mention the fugitive  .  Vela is the same congressman who, as reported by Breitbart Texas last summer, teamed up with Jason Chaffetz to demand answers from Kerry about the lack of security conditions at American consulates in Mexico. Despite the political pressure, Kerry continues to ignore their demands.  “It is safe to say the Department of State is ignoring our calls to bring peace to Mexico,” Vela said to Breitbart Texas.
