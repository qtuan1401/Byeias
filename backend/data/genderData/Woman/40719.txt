 (CNN) Justin Bieber’s Comedy Central roast was a mostly hilarious affair, until the very end when, following a rebuttal (among the highlights: ”What do you get when you give a teenager $200 million? A bunch of   calling you a lesbian for two hours” and ”A big screen for Kevin Hart is an iPad mini”) the    pop star took a moment to reflect on his troubles in recent years. After some   quips    ”I turned a plane into a bong”    Bieber acknowledged having ”turned a lot of people off the past few years. . .. There was no preparing me for this life. I got thrown into this, 12 years old. There are moments I’m proud of and things I’ve done that don’t define who I am. I look forward to being someone you’re proud of. . .. I’m excited to see what’s next.” Looking in the camera, he declared, ”You have my word    I will not end up broken, pathetic, bitter or sitting on someone else’s roast. I’m at a moment of change. This is a new day.” Justin Bieber’s cool cred, manhood mocked at Comedy Central Roast (includes profane language) Following the   taping, Bieber spoke with reporters about the verbal beatdown, revealing that the many Selena Gomez jokes didn’t bother him.  ”Everybody was going balls to the wall,” said Bieber. ”It was whatever.” Has Bieber been photoshopped?
