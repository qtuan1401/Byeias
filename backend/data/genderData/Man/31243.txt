Charles Barkley’s mocking of ESPN is one of the funniest things I’ve heard all year pic. twitter.  After the Golden State Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder Thursday, TNT “Inside the NBA”   Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith joked about the possibility of Barkley going to work at ESPN.  “You’re not gonna work me like a dog and not pay me,” Barkley said. “They’ll have me on ESPN One, Two, Three, ESPN News, ESPNU, ESPN Radio!” he continued. “They’re gonna have me on ESPN Deportes, saying, ‘Muy bien, gracias!” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
