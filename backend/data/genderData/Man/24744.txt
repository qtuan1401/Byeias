In response to the Orlando terror attack —  allegedly carried out by Omar Mateen —  the Pink Pistols released a statement in which they suggested this attack is the very kind of incident that justifies their continual call for gays to arm themselves. [In the statement, Pink Pistols speaker Gwendolyn Patton urged gay Americans to avoid the easy,   reaction of blaming the attacker’s guns for the evil which the attacker perpetrated. Patton said:  Let us not reach for the   fruit of blaming the killer’s guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. A human being did this. The human being’s tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that person’s soul. Patton went on to say, “GUNS did not do this.

Our job now is not to demonize the man’s tools, but to condemn his acts and work to prevent such acts in the future. ” Patton pointed to the fact that it is difficult to carry guns in bars in some states —  because of   prohibitions. But Patton suggested this can sometimes be remedied by a designated driver who agrees to forgo any alcohol for the night so that that driver can carry a gun with which to protect his companions.
