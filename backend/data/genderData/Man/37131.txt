 (CNN) An upcoming Hillary Clinton fundraiser was recast Saturday when Leonardo DiCaprio dropped out of hosting the gala    instead asking his Hollywood pal, Justin Timberlake, and his wife, Jessica Biel, to take over. A source with knowledge of the event told CNN the ”Revenant” star had to cancel due to a scheduling conflict. Timberlake and Biel ”immediately” agreed to host at their home in Hollywood Hills on Tuesday, the source added. As was the case with the event at Dicaprio’s house, Scooter Braun, the agent that discovered Justin Bieber, and Tobey Maguire, the actor known for his roles in the   series, will also host the   event. The event is part of a     trip to California for Clinton, where the Democratic nominee is expected to raise millions of dollars from fundraisers with   performers, athletes and tech tycoons. While in Los Angeles, Clinton will also headline an event at the Beverly Hills home of Hall of Fame basketball player and businessman Magic Johnson. That event    which California Clinton donors predict will raise millions on its own    will also be hosted by Bob Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company, and his wife, Willow Bay, along with Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation.  DiCaprio, who attended a Clinton fundraiser earlier this year, is in New York working to finish his current project, a climate change documentary, titled ”Before the Flood,” in time for it to premier at the Toronto Film Festival next month. The documentary is a look at what the United States can do to prevent climate change from adversely impacting endangered species, ecosystems and native communities around the world. Former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton’s husband, is featured in the movie.
