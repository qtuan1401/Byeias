Listen to this week’s podcast | Subscribe: iTunes | RSS | Stitcher| Audioboom Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday, cited for “new poetic expression within the great American song tradition”  —   leaving some delighted and some disgruntled that a songwriter would overshadow novelists and poets. Jon Pareles, The Times’s chief pop music critic, and Dwight Garner, a New York Times book critic, take to the podwaves with the pop reporter Joe Coscarelli to talk about the stakes for the literary world, about how lyrics are and aren’t poetry and about Dylan on love and death. They also discuss whether rock needs validation as literature, favorite Dylan lyrics and concerts through the years and a Dylan performance just last week  —   at the Desert Trip festival (also known as Oldchella) in California. “People are crazy, and times are strange,” as Mr. Dylan has observed.
