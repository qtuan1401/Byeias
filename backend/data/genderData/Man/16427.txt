A MILO event at North Dakota State University has been cancelled following threats from opponents of the North Dakota Access Pipeline who have previously been involved in violent protests. [The event which was scheduled for Friday, December 16th, was suddenly hit with a large security fee increase however unlike many other universities that used security fees as an attempt to censor MILO, the threat by Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters to disrupt the event posed a viable risk to those in attendance.   “Unfortunately the state of North Dakota has a issue with our pipeline” said Jamal Omar, a North Dakota University student and Vice Chair of the College Republicans who invited MILO to speak. “Many of the protesters (some of which have shot at officers) wanted to protest here and unfortunately we couldn’t manage to keep people safe. ” Omar also defended his college administration’s efforts to host MILO: “The university was very helpful and affordable charging only 1500 dollars for the 2 rooms, 5 officers, IT support, parking, and all other required amenities. We appreciate the support our university that had helped defend us all the way in our pursuit of free speech, but we do not want the lives of any individual to be put on the line because of those who wish to cause harm. ” Breitbart News has previously covered the protests at the North Dakota Access Pipeline and the attacks that many workers have come under. The United States Army also recently surrendered to protesters at the pipeline. When asked for comment on the event MILO said, “Normally I have no problem being shot in the face by masked assailants but in this case we couldn’t risk student safety. I might have to go visit these ridiculous troublemakers at the pipeline itself. Anyone know where I can buy a water cannon?”  MILO is set to speak at Miami University, Ohio on December 5th.
