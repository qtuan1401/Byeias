London (CNN) For royal watchers    and fans of cute children    they are images to be treasured.  Four photographs released Saturday by Kensington Palace show Prince George with his new baby sister, Princess Charlotte, for the first time. George, dressed in white and blue, sits holding his royal sibling, all in white and then only a couple of weeks old, in what looks like the image of brotherly affection. In one picture, he even gently plants a kiss on her temple. And the photographer behind the lens? None other than the young royals’ own mother, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. According to Kensington Palace, the photographs were taken by Catherine in   at Anmer Hall in Norfolk, the country home she shares with Prince William when not at their official residence at Kensington Palace in London. Similarly informal photographs were released of Prince George in August 2013, taken when he was about the same age. Those were snapped by Catherine’s father, Michael Middleton, and met a mixed response. The release of the images comes a day after the palace announced that Charlotte, who’s fourth in line to the throne, would be christened on July 5 at the nearby St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham. Charlotte’s   Queen Elizabeth II, has her country retreat in Sandringham, about 180 kilometers (110 miles) north of London’s Buckingham Palace, and the royal family has a long connection with the country church.  The baby girl, whose full name is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge, was born May 2 at a London hospital.
