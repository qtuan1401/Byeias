On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that if Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wins, “it is possible that Obama will pardon the remaining high officials, who are going to have to end  —   who are going to up in office with her, as a way out of this, because otherwise, this [her email conduct] could pursue her and pursue them into her presidency. ”  Krauthammer said, “Look, it looks awful. Normally you give immunity so that you can prosecute. You may lose the case, but at least you [prosecute.] There’s not even a prosecution. The impression left is, and we probably will never know, it was understood, not said, not written, not emailed, but it was understood we were not going to indict the Democratic candidate for the presidency, and thus everything else followed. And the close aides are getting immunity as well. It looks very suspicious. I credit Comey’s sincerity, but I don’t know what role he played. ” He continued, “The one thing I would say is that, if she wins, I think it is possible that Obama will pardon the remaining high officials, who are going to have to end  —   who are going to up in office with her, as a way out of this, because otherwise, this could pursue her and pursue them into her presidency. Remember, Watergate came after, long after a  . So, there’s a fuse here, that I think will remain lit otherwise. ” (Video via National Review) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
