’  ’ ’   The Model 3 will use some of the same glass technology that Tesla   is using for its solar roof shingles, CEO Elon Musk said   Tuesday during a conference call regarding the financial   details of a SolarCity merger, which shareholders will vote on   November 17. ’ ’   Musk said that Tesla now has a special glass technology   group and that the new division is focused on developing the   technology for the  with SolarCity last   Friday.  ’ ”   He added that the Model 3 will incorpoate that same glass   technology being used in the solar roof, but didn’t elaborate   further. ” ’   ”It is using a lot of techniques from the automotive glass   business and, in case it wasn’’t obvious with the announcement,   Tesla has created a glass technology group with some really   phenomenol people,” Musk said on the call. ’ ’   Musk did offer some additional insight about the glass in a tweet   Friday night. He said the glass can incorporate heating   elements to clear snow while generating energy. He added that the   glass wouldn’’t waste energy while using said heating elements,   adding it would be ”strongly net positive.” ’ ’   Tesla could then be using the glass for a number of things, like   a solar roof for the Model 3 or to make its windshield. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tSolar glass tiles can also incorporate heating elements, like rear defroster on a car, to clear roof of snow and keep generating energy’t’t’ ’    ’ ’  strongly net positive’t’t’
