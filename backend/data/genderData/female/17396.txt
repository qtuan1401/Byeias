Top campaign aides for Hillary Clinton gossiped over email last year after former Vice President Al Gore signaled that he wasn’t ready to endorse a candidate for president. [In November 2015, Clinton aide Cheryl Mills forwarded a People magazine article to John Podesta and Huma Abedin where Gore declined to endorse Hillary Clinton in the interview.  “Yes he warned us,” Abedin replied. When Podesta queried as to why, Abedin explained that Gore had told them when the campaign began that he wouldn’t endorse Clinton. “Curiuos (sic)  —   why?” asked Mills, “As he clearly expected her to endorse him as vp when he ran. ” “Well that was 16 years ago,” she wrote. “Hard to put on email but there is no love lost in this relationship. Reminder that he also refused to endorse in 2008! !!” Mills signaled that she hoped that it would be “different” in 2016. “No. It’s bad,” Abedin replied cryptically. The emailed conversation was included in John Podesta’s private emails that were publicly released by WikiLeaks. Although the relationship was bad, the Clinton campaign successfully wooed Gore back into the fold earlier this month, nearly a year after the first interview. On October 11, Gore appeared with Clinton in Florida for a campaign event, where they both preached global warming alarmism to voters on the coast.
