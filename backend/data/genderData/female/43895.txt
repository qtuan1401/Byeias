’  ’ ”   In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on   Monday, Republican Sens. Rob Portman, Shelley Moore Capito,   Cory Gardner, and Lisa Murkowski laid out concerns regarding the   repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, in what could   be the beginning of serious trouble for the GOP’s plan to   overhaul the healthcare law. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’While we support efforts to repeal and replace the   Affordable Care Act and make structural reforms to the Medicaid   program, we are concerned that the February 10th draft proposal   from the House of Representatives does not provide stability and   certainty for individuals and families in Medicaid expansion   programs or the necessary flexibility for states,” ’ ’’ ’   The House GOP bill would shift the current funding structure and   would put more of the funding onus on the states, which may be   difficult to sustain given already stretched state budgets. ’ ’   In the letter, the senators advocated for more ”flexibility”   for states that want to expand Medicaid and urged a longer   timeframe for the transition of Medicaid programs. ’ ’   ” ’ ’   The senators suggested they would not support the draft plan in   its current form. It would represent a significant blow to GOP   efforts to repeal and replace the law, as the loss of four votes   would almost certainly kill Republican efforts to pass   legislation. ’ ’   ” ’ ’  ’ ’In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
