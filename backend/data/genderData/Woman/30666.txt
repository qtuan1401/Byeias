Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,”   Mika Brzezinski revealed a moment in this year’s presidential contest which the Clinton campaign had attempted to go over her head to NBC management for criticizing that campaign’s effort.  Brzezinski said when she had warned the campaign of being arrogant, the Clinton campaign acted as if she had done something “journalistically inappropriate” and “needed to be pull off the air. ” “Listen, when I was concerned the campaign was not understanding that perhaps there was an arrogance that they need to get off their high horse and understand that this wasn’t over,” Brzezinski said. “I’ll just say it  —   NBC got a call from the campaign, like I had done something that was journalistically inappropriate or something and needed to be pulled off the air. I mean, think about that. That’s just  —   shooting the wrong messenger. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
