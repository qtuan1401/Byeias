.@BillNye: Louisiana’s eroding coastline ”is a result of climate change, it’s only going to get worse” https:  .  On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “New Day,” Bill Nye “the Science Guy” told host Chris Cuomo that he sees the devastating flooding in Louisiana as a product of   climate change.  “For us, on my side of this  —   this is a result of climate change,” Nye said. “It’s only going to get worse. ” “I don’t have the answer to this except it is going to get worse,” he added. “It almost certainly will get worse. Everybody  —   as the ocean gets warmer, which it is getting, it expands. Water gets  —   the molecules spread apart and then as the sea surface gets warmer, more water evaporates. And so it is very reasonable that these storms are connected to these big effects. So what will probably happen is people will move. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
