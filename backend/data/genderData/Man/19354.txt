A Police Foundation report on the San Bernardino terror attack shows that three unnamed men “sacrificed themselves” by charging Sayed Farook and Tashfeen Malik once the couple opened fire. [Farook and Malik shot and killed 14   during a party in a   San Bernardino county building on December 2.  According to the Associated Press, party attendees hid under tables or tried to flee exit doors when Farook entered the room dressed in black and opened fire. Malik followed, shooting at innocents as well. At one point in the attack, three party attendees attempted to   the couple and stop the slaughter. In summarizing the attack, U. S. Attorney Eileen Decker alluded to the sacrifice of the men: These victims had no chance to protect themselves as a result of the callous perpetration of violence, while others heroically sacrificed themselves in an attempt to stop the shooting, In the face of this unfathomable suffering, the law enforcement personnel and citizens who put themselves in harm’s way to help others exemplifies the very best that our country has to offer. During the December 14, 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary, which also occurred in a   zone, school principal Dawn Hochsprung similarly sacrificed herself. Hochsprung was killed while charging Adam Lanza in an attempt to stop the attack. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
