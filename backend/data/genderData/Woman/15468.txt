Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while discussing Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) performance at Saturday’s ABC News Republican presidential debate in which he repeated several times that President Barack Obama’s policies are no accident but instead he knows exactly what he is doing, MSNBC’s “Hardball” host Chris Matthews called it “strange” and said it was “not a human response. ”  Matthews said, “That was numerable times, it reminded me of the science fiction film ‘Blade Runner’ where someone in this case Chris Christie proved out there was a replica instead of not a human being. It was strange because he was reading these prerecorded statements which are like implanted memory tracks. They were not a human response. And I think he’s got no answer for it. And I think it was so strange I have no idea why he did it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
