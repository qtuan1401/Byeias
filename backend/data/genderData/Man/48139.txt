’  ’ ’   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a CEO who knows a thing or two   about building a   company. And he thinks that   a lot of people in Silicon Valley are doing it backward by   focusing on building a company before knowing what they want to   do. ’ ’   ” ’ ’   Zuckerberg says that he never set out to build a company. Even   after he had raised venture capital and the idea was taking off,   Zuckerberg was insisting that he was going to go back to Harvard. ’ ’   That never happened, and Facebook is now used by more than a   billion people every day. It took that belief, though, to   get him through the tough times. ’ ’   ”I always think that you should start with the problem that   you’’re trying to solve in the world and not start with   deciding that you want to build a company,” Zuckerberg said.   ”And the best companies that get built are things that are trying   to drive some kind of social change, even if it’’s just local   in one place, more than starting out because you want to   make a bunch of money or have a lot of people working for   you or build some company in some way.” ’
