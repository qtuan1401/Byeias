Thursday, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan posted a video on his Facebook page from “The Cliff Kelley Show” on WVON from Dec. 12, 2015, in which he said “the system of justice in America should all be destroyed. ”  Discussing the controversy surrounding the Chicago police department over the shooting death of Laquan McDonald, which is calling into question the leadership of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Farrakhan said, “This is pointing not to getting rid of a mayor or getting rid of a police chief or getting rid of a state’s attorney. What the hell difference does it make if you get rid of them and the system that produces them is still in place? There is no such thing as reforming this. This has to completely be taken down. Who is man enough? Who is strong enough to say that the system of justice in America is an injustice to the American people? It all should be destroyed and something new and better put in place. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
