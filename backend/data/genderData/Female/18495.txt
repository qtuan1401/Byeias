In an interview that aired on CNN’s “New Day,” Gov. Maggie Hassan ( ) the Democratic opponent for Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( ) in the upcoming New Hampshire U. S. Senate election, refused on three separate occasions to say whether or not she thought Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was “honest. ”  When first asked by CNN’s Manu Raju, Hassan explained she supported Clinton for her experience. “I support Hillary Clinton for the presidency because her experience and her record demonstrate that she’s qualified to hold the job,” Hassan replied. Raju later followed up with the same question, to which Hassan replied by touting her “critical plan” to make college affordable. “She has a critical, critical plan among others for making college more affordable,” she answered. On the third occasion, Hassan said she was supporting Clinton because of her commitment. “I think she has demonstrated a commitment always to something beyond herself bigger than herself,” Hassan added. Raju said following the interview, Hassan’s campaign reached out to clarify that she does believe Clinton is honest. After the interview aired, Ayotte’s campaign issued a statement criticizing Hassan for her inability to answer questions. “Governor Hassan has consistently refused to answer simple questions and give straight answers to voters about where she stands,” campaign spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in a statement. “This interview is just the latest proof that Hassan will not be an independent voice for New Hampshire, because she is more concerned with staying on script than being upfront with voters. ” Follow Jeff Poor Twitter @jeff_poor
