GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina impressed a veteran at a town hall in Marion, Iowa, so much that he took off his hat and started a collection for her —  raising roughly $800 by the end of the event. [“I would like to offer a challenge,” John Nieland said to the audience at Fiorina’s town hall, according to The Des Moines Register. “I have a $100 bill here, and I’m going to put it in my hat. I’ll be at that door after she finishes, and I’m sure she will take 100s, 50s, 20s, 10s, 5s, 1s or even pocket change. ”  “We need to make sure she has what she needs to go all the way,” he explained. “Let’s help her out for a very expensive campaign. ” By the end of the event, Nieland raised nearly $800 dollars, which reportedly went to an official from the Super PAC supporting Fiorina’s campaign, CARLY for America. “I was totally unprepared for his incredible generosity,” Fiorina responded to the donation. “It brings tears to my eyes thinking about it. ” The Register’s Courtney Crowder wrote, “What happened today is just one example of the support that Carly Fiorina continues to find throughout the Hawkeye State leading up to Monday’s caucus —  and one more example that the more that people get to know Carly, the more they like her. ”
