Hillary Clinton did not turn over an important email about the problems caused by her use of a private email server for classified information.  “In November 2010, Secretary Clinton and her Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations discussed the fact that Secretary Clinton’s emails to Department employees were not being received,” according to the report. Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff told her that “we should talk about putting you on state email or releasing your email address to the department so you are not going to spam. ” Hillary Clinton replied, “Let’s get separate address or device but I don’t want any risk of the personal being accessible. ” Breitbart News has led the media in covering the Clinton email case, including first reporting that Clinton had “Top Secret” classified emails on her private server.
