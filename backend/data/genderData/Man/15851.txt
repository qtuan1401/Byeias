Pop stars can get starstruck, too. [Madonna fulfilled a longtime wish Wednesday night when she met President Obama backstage at the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where the president sat down for an interview while the singer performed as musical guest.  The    pop queen posted two photos to her Instagram page detailing the meeting. In the first, she said she was simply left “speechless. ”  For Once  I ’m Speechless  …      …      …    . .President Obama 🇺🇸 @jimmyfallon, A photo posted by Madonna (@madonna) on Jun 8, 2016 at 4:01pm PDT,   A meeting of the Leo’s! .

Madonna has long wanted to meet the president. In an interview with Us Weekly in March of last year, the pop star said the person she wanted to meet most in the world was Obama. “When the heck am I going to meet him?” Madonna told the magazine. “He just needs to invite me to the White House already. He probably thinks I’m too shocking to be there. I’m serious. If I was a little bit more demure  …     or if I was just married to Jay Z. Hey, if Jay would only take me as his second wife, then I’d score an invitation. ” The singer is apparently a big fan of the president. In 2012, she ordered audiences on her MDNA tour to vote for Obama’s reelection, even though it reportedly caused some of her conservative fans to head for the exits.
