LOS ANGELES  —   Having taken aggressive steps to change its membership roster, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has opted to keep its leadership the same: Cheryl Boone Isaacs was elected on Tuesday night to a fourth consecutive   term as the group’s president. Four is the maximum number of successive years a president can serve, according to academy bylaws. (A fifth term is possible, if unlikely. Ms. Isaacs, 66, would have to step aside for at least a year.) Ms. Isaacs, a former Paramount Pictures publicity executive, has worked in recent years with Dawn Hudson, the academy’s chief executive, to maintain the organization’s insular culture while also contending with intense pressure to make its membership less white and male. Last month, the academy invited 683 people to become members  —   more than twice last year’s number  —   after pledging to double its female and minority membership by 2020, an almost impossible goal. The group’s annual Academy Awards are granted by its roughly 7, 000 voting members. The next Oscar ceremony will be held on Feb. 26, with nominations scheduled to be announced on Jan. 24. The academy’s acting branch put forward all white nominees in the last two Oscar cycles, resulting in blistering criticism. Ms. Isaacs and Ms. Hudson, whose working relationship has at times been fraught, will have to contend with more than diversity initiatives over the coming year. The academy’s $388 million movie museum, for instance, is lurching toward a planned 2018 opening but still faces funding and operational obstacles. Ms. Isaacs was   by the   board as part of a slate that includes Jeffrey Kurland as first vice president John Bailey, Kathleen Kennedy and Nancy Utley as vice presidents Jim Gianopulos as treasurer and David Rubin as secretary.
