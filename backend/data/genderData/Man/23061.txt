Transcript as follows: “You know, friends, so many people have wished me congratulations on a   career in baseball and they wished me a wonderful retirement with my family and now, all I can do is tell you what I wish for you. ” ‘May God give you.. For every storm, a rainbow, For every tear, a smile, For every care, a promise, And a blessing in each trial. For every problem life sends, A faithful friend to share, For every sigh, a sweet song, And an answer for each prayer.’ You and I have been friends for a long time, but I know in my heart that I’ve always needed you more than you’ve ever needed me. And I’ll miss our time together more than I can say. But you know what? There will be a new day and, eventually, a new year. And when the upcoming winter gives way to spring, oh, rest assured, once again, it will be time for Dodger baseball. So this is Vin Scully, wishing you a very pleasant good afternoon  —   wherever you may be. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
