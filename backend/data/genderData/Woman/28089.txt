Monday during her speech on economics in Toledo, OH, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the country had “been moving off track for decades” with regards to the economy.  Clinton said, “We have unmatched talent, innovation, entrepreneurial spirit. So when we work together we can all benefit. Now I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility, not just to their biggest shareholders, but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities and, yes, to their country, to the United States of America. We have been moving off track for decades. I don’t need to tell you that. You know it. You lived it. You have seen it. It is time to get back on track. And you can ask anybody who’s worked for me or with me, who’s served with me. When I try to do something I will get up every day and work my heart out for you. So let’s begin by making it clear that for most businesses, America is the most important asset on their balance sheet. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
