The man and seven children, whose ages ranged from 6 to 16, were discovered in the home,  Princess Anne Police Chief Scott Keller said. No foul play is suspected in the deaths, he said, adding that everyone in the house was related.  The electricity in the home was powered by a generator, the chief said. He wouldn’t comment when asked if the deaths were related to carbon monoxide poisoning.  ”We have some ideas (about what happened),” Keller said. ”I really don’t want to say until the medical examiner can confirm it.” The children’s mother had been notified about the deaths, but authorities were still withholding the names of the deceased. Keller said he couldn’t give any more details before the cause of the deaths is determined. Autopsies are scheduled for Tuesday.
