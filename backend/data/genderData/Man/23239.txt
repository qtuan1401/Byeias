Students at a West Virginia elementary school were surprised when they showed up for school one morning last week to find a   Elf on the Shelf sitting on the roof, says a WPXI report.  Shawn Adkins was sitting on the roof of Lavalette Elementary School dressed as an Elf on the Shelf doll as students arrived, and says the look on students’ faces made it all worthwhile for him. “Big smiles,” Adkins, a parent of the school, told WXPI. “95 percent of the kids were all smiles when they saw me on the roof, when I saw their jaws drop from the road as they were pulling down to get out of their cars. ” The bearded elf said he plans to come to come back to the school next Christmas.
