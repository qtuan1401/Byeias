Thursday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” former Gov. Ed Rendell ( ) the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, predicted that in order for Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) to win the Democratic presidential nomination, he’ll have to win a significant majority the elected delegates to overcome the number of   superdelegates supporting Hillary Clinton.  “I think because of the superdelegates who cast their vote based on electability have serious doubts whether Bernie Sanders could be electable once the GOP starts campaigning against him and putting ads against him,” Rendell said. “I think Hillary’s going to do very well with superdelegates. That means Bernie would have to win a significant majority of the elected delegates. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
