A spokesman for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reacted with disbelief after the F. B. I. informed congress that they were reviewing the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. [“It boggles the mind why this step was taken with just 11 days to go,” Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon explained in an interview on MSNBC.  Fallon specifically cited Comey’s assertion that it was unclear whether information would affect the case and called for the F. B. I to hold a press conference to explain his actions. “The American people need to have the full facts,” he said. Fallon said the Clinton campaign believed that there would be no change to Comey’s conclusion in July, when he said that there was not enough information to prosecute Clinton for breaking the law. “We are fully confident that at the end of this review, however long it takes, that there will be no conclusion drawn that would at all have changed the outcome of the investigation that was wrapped up in July,” he said.
