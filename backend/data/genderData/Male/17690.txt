“Heroes” serenaded British athletes as they entered Olympic Stadium for the 2012 summer games. “Under Pressure” plays as a familiar soundtrack within sporting arenas. [So when David Bowie passed away overnight at 69 following a long battle with cancer, athletes sang the praises of the man who so often sang to them over stadium speakers.  Prayers going up to #davidbowiereal family. He was a MTV music legend. #RIP https:  .   —   Torii Hunter (@toriihunter48) January 11, 2016,  Rip D Bow #groundcontroltomajortom,  —   Julian Edelman (@Edelman11) January 11, 2016,  Rest in peace David Bowie, who played Roker Park in June 1987.

From Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust persona through his surreal   Pierrot in “Ashes to Ashes,” class freaks flocked to the artist who redirected mainstream currents toward him. The jocks, apparently, appreciated him, too.
