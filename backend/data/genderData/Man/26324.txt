Bill Maher, the host of HBO’s “Real Time,” mocked Congressional Democrats’ gun control   as “like a toddler in the cereal aisle” on Friday.  Maher said, “I mean, do we need any more proof how dysfunctional this Congress is when they’re literally sitting on the floor like a toddler in the cereal aisle? They said they were going to stay there until gun control passed or mom buys  . Several of the House members were asked how long they were willing to keep their protest going by staying seated on the floor, and they said, until hell freezes over, or one day. One day. I’ve waited longer for the cable guy. are you f*cking kidding me? Stop guns? They didn’t even stop the cleaning crew from coming in and shampooing the rugs. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
