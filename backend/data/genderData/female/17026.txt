Twitter has released a new monetization tool for videos on the platform, adding the ability to include  before videos. [“In June, we shared a variety of ways that Twitter is investing in video, including longer video, new ways to explore video, and better ways for creators to connect with their fans,” said Twitter in a post on their official blog. “Today, we’re excited to announce the expansion of our creator revenue programs, which will provide creators of all sizes with the ability to monetize content in multiple ways and generate revenue at scale. ”  The new monetization tool will allow users to include or remove ads on their videos, or automatically set them for each upload. The social network has also unveiled a new “Media Studio” to manage uploads and schedules. Today, we’re announcing product upgrades that will make publishing and monetizing on Twitter as effortless as sending a Tweet. Creators can now upload, manage and publish media more efficiently and effectively than ever before across both Desktop (via the new Media Studio) and Mobile (via the Twitter Engage app). Media Studio, which replaces video. twitter. com, provides a comprehensive Desktop destination where you can access all of our publishing tools and resources. In a possible move to draw users to Twitter away from other video platforms, Twitter is reportedly offering users 70% of the ad revenue generated by their videos. The service is currently only available for users in the United States of America. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
