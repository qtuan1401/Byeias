A woman at Starbucks in Gainesville, FL, screamed at Gov. Rick Scott ( ) about Obamacare and abortion.[  “You cut Medicaid so I couldn’t get Obamacare,” she yelled at Gov. Scott. “You’re an assh*le. You don’t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here. ” She even silenced one of Scott’s aides before he could intervene. The media identified the woman as Cara Jennings, a    mother and former Lake Worth city commissioner. Scott attempted to defend himself by claiming he created millions of jobs, but Jennings kept interrupting him. “A million jobs? Great, who here has a great job?” she asked the people around her. “Or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?” As he left the store, she lambasted him over abortion and stripping “women of access to public health care. ” “Shame on you Rick Scott,” she declared. “We depend on those services. Rich people like you don’t know what to do! When poorer people like us need services you cut them. Shame on you Rick Scott! You’re an embarrassment to our state!”
