Saturday night at the 46th Annual Legislative Conference Phoenix Awards Dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus, President Barack Obama told the audience it would be a “personal insult” to his legacy if they did not vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.  Obama shouted, “My name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. There’s no such thing as a vote that doesn’t matter. It all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the   community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote!” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
