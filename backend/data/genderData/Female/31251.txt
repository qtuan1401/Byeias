A viral video posted to YouTube shows a woman apparently preventing a motorcyclist from merging, and now the woman is paying for it, says a WFSB report.  According to police, the woman, identified as Michelle Lynch, cut into the motorcyclistâ€™s lane without yielding Tuesday. The motorcyclist, David Bafumo, recorded the incident with his phone, and later uploaded it YouTube. He signaled Sgt. Mike Prescher of the South Windsor Police Department in South Windsor, CT, who happened to be sitting in a parking lot just down the road. Prescher told Bafumo to follow him, and the two quickly caught up with Lynch. She was issued two infractions, passing on the right and failure to drive right, totaling $264.
