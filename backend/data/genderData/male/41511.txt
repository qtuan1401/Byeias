 (CNN) There’s this new movie out that you may have heard of? ”Avengers: Age of Ultron” apparently couldn’t be much bigger or beloved, as far of fans are concerned. In an age when super heroes reign supreme, this one packs not only multiple stars, but also the potential to blast the box office. Industry analysts are predicting it to smash receipt records. CNN Money: ’Avengers’ assembling for shot at box office record, But should you see it? If the reaction from the Thursday night screenings are any indication, why are you even still reading this? You should be at the theater RIGHT NOW. But professional critics aren’t being as effusive. ’Avengers: Age of Ultron’: Film review, Reviewing the sequel to 2012’s ”The Avengers,” Andrew Lapin of NPR writes that ”he film lacks the giddiness of ’Guardians Of The Galaxy,’ the stylistic touches of ’Captain America: The Winter Soldier,’ the (relatively) deep introspection of ’Iron Man 3. ’” ”It is, in short, more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace,” Lapin said. ”This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun?” Likewise Kenneth Turan over at the Los Angles Times writes that while the movie has its moments, ”the uncomfortable reality remains that although this movie is effective moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward.” Criticism is great and all, but the people have spoken and they really aren’t sweating you people who get paid to tell the world what you think.
