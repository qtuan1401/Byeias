    months after Comedy Central canceled his   TV show, Larry Wilmore has a gig with ABC Studios. Mr. Wilmore will develop scripted material for that   studio, and will work with network executives in helping to recruit talent, ABC said. Exact terms of the multiyear deal were not disclosed. Mr. Wilmore, who was the “senior black correspondent” on “The Daily Show” during Jon Stewart’s tenure, is certainly familiar with ABC. He helped develop the network’s hit comedy “” and was expected to be one of the show’s top producers before being tapped by Comedy Central to host a show in Stephen Colbert’s old time slot. That did not work out. “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore” made its debut in January 2015, but Comedy Central canceled it in August because of falling ratings. “Disney took a chance on me as a young writer years ago and so I’m thrilled to return to the Mouse House,” Mr. Wilmore said in a statement. “I hope my room still looks the same. ” Mr. Wilmore is also an executive producer of HBO’s “Insecure,” the Issa Rae comedy that was renewed for a second season this month.
