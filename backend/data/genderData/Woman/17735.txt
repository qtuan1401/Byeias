A Florida Walmart is facing backlash over its    Coke display after a shopper posted a picture of the design to Twitter. [Shawn Richard tweeted a picture of the display, which showed the twin towers recreated with Coke Zero packages. The American flag in the background was made up of regular Coke, Diet Coke, and blue Sprite packages.  Twitter users immediately responded with angry retweets. “We stopped and stared at it like, oh my god,” Richard said, according to BuzzFeed News. “Nobody seemed to be noticing it, it wasn’t very crowded, and I got the feeling that it had just been assembled. So we took some pics and went on our way. ” Walmart removed the display Wednesday and issued an apology, according to Orlando Weekly. “We hold this moment in our country’s history in the highest regard, and there was nothing disrespectful intended by the display, a Walmart spokesperson said to CBS News. The spokesperson also said Walmart approved the   display idea that was originally from Coke.
