On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” when confronted with video of FBI director James Comey saying during her tenure as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did send classified information over her private unsecured email server, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the emails in question were classified “retroactively. ”  Clinton said, “That’s not what I heard director Comey say, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity in my view clarify. Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I’ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the  . I was communicating with over 300 people in my  . They certainly did not believe and no reason to believe that what they were sending was classified. In retrospect, different agencies come in and say, well, it should have been, but that’s not what was happening in real time. ” When confronted with video from a congressional hearing on July 7 of Comey directly contradicting her, Clinton said, “Well, Chris, I looked at the whole transcript of everything that was said, and what I believe is, number one, I made a mistake not using two different   addresses. I have said that and I repeat it again today. It is certainly not anything I would ever do again. I take classification seriously. I relied on and had every reason to rely on the judgments of the professionals with whom I worked. And so in retrospect, maybe some people are saying, well, among those 300 people they made the wrong call. There was no reason in my view to doubt the professionalism and the determination by the people who work every single day on behave of our country. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
