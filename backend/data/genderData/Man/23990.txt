During the 2013 State of the Union Address, President Obama said, “by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over. ”  Obama said, “Already, we have brought home 33, 000 of our brave servicemen and women. This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead. Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34, 000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over. ” (  Jimmy Princeton) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
