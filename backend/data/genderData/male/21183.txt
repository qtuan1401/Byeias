Thursday The Weather Channel aired a   warning urging the public to take it seriously and evacuate if they live in the areas under evacuation orders for Hurricane Matthew.  Meteorologist and hurricane specialist Bryan Norcross said, ‘I’m senior hurricane specialist, Bryan Norcross, and I want to talk to my friends in Florida. Today on behalf of The Weather Channel, I have a special message about the threat from Hurricane Matthew. This is like no storm in the record books. We are concerned about reports of people deciding to stay in areas under mandatory evacuation orders. This is a mistake. This is not hype. This is not hyperbole, and I am not kidding. ” “I cannot overstate the danger of this storm. Central and North Florida have never been hit by a hurricane this strong,” he continued. “If you live in a Florida evacuation zone, you need to head for a safe spot now. Do not assume you can survive if you choose to stay. There will be overwhelming damage, and likely a heartbreaking loss of life. Based on everything we know, Matthew will make history. The Weather Channel does not want you to be part of that history. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
