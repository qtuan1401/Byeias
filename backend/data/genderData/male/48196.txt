’  ’ ’   Lyft President John Zimmer blasted reports that the     company is shopping itself around, disputing a series of recent   news stories saying that Lyft had failed to find a buyer   after talking to six different companies. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Getting approached and then having it characterized as us   wanting to sell the business and failing to do so is a large   mischaracterization,” he said. ”If the company is approached, it   doesn’’t mean the company is looking.” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Rumors that Lyft had been up for sale started in June when The   Wall Street Journal  a   Silicon Valley firm with a reputation for orchestrating sales   like the   deal. Companies typically hire   bankers to find buyers for a business, or in the case of an   unsolicited offer, to compare the offer to the price others might   be willing to pay. ’ ”   Lyft declined to comment on Qatalyst, but Zimmer stressed to   Business Insider that the company has never been actively looking   for a buyer. It’s already had acquisition offers throughout its   history as a company, and Zimmer says that the company is   obligated to review them. ” ’   ” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Lyft has previously declined to comment on all M&A rumors,   but Zimmer now says that ”enough is enough.” He’’s pointing the   finger at Uber as the company using ”unsavory tactics” to spread   the negative or misleading reports. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   Zimmer would not go into detail about how he believed Uber   had spread the false reports, but a  on Sunday quoted an anonymous source as   saying that Lyft was furious that Uber’s CEO had discussed his   views on Lyft’s valuation with investors. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
