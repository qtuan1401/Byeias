In an interview with NPR’s “Weekend Edition,” Vice President Joe Biden discussed the upcoming presidential, in particular the “cloud” over presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state.  Biden told NPR’s Rachel Martin that while he couldn’t comment on the situation specifically, he said he found it hard to believe she “would do anything intentionally wrong. ” Partial transcript as follows: MARTIN: We only have a couple moments left. And we are talking in the middle of a presidential election. There’s just a couple of weeks  …     BIDEN:   …    Is that right? MARTIN: Yeah, I don’t know if you’ve heard. BIDEN: Oh (laughter). MARTIN: Yeah, kind of a big deal. Couple weeks till the conventions. Your candidate, the presumptive Democratic nominee  …     BIDEN: She is my candidate. MARTIN:   …    Hillary Clinton  —   there is still a cloud over her in terms of whether or not she will face an indictment for her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. BIDEN: Under the law  …     MARTIN:   …    Do you think she did anything wrong? BIDEN: Under the law  —   I can’t comment on that for the following reason. If I comment and tell you what I think, which is positive, then the easy accusation would be Biden is vice president and probably put pressure on one of the government agencies to keep that from happening. The president and I have kept our hands off completely. What we do know is that she is incredibly  —   by leaps and bounds more qualified than the other person to be the president of the United States. I’ve known her for 40 years. I’m a friend of hers. And I don’t  —   I find it hard to believe that she would do anything intentionally wrong. (  Mediaite) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
