Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” when asked by CNN’s Dana Bash if President Obama’s statement offing condolences over the death of “brutal dictator,” Fidel Castro, former Democratic primary candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said he would have done the same.  Partial transcript as follows: BASH: Let me start with Cuba. In President Obama’s statement on Fidel Castro’s death he said we offer condolences to Fidel Castro’s family and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. Is it appropriate for the leader of the free world to offer condolences for a brutal dictator that killed his own people as well as Americans. SANDERS: What we’ve seen in the last number of years is an improved relationship between the United States of America and Cuba. United States of America has relations with China, we’ve had relation with brutal dictatorships all over the world. The goal is now to improve our relationship with people of Cuba, to do what we can to improve their economy and to make sure that the younger generation does better than their older generation. BASH: So, you’re OK with him offering condolences, if you were president would you have said something similar. SANDERS: Yeah. Yes, I would have. Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
