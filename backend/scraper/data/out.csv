USA Today,0,[Zimmerman verdict renews focus on 'stand your ground' laws],"The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Sanford Fla. raised fresh discussion of ""stand your ground"" laws. The case centered around whether Zimmerman acted in self defense and drew national attention to Florida's law which allows people to defend themselves with force if they feel threatened in their home business car or a place where they ""have a legal right to be."" At least 22 states have a similar law according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. While Zimmerman did not ultimately use the ""stand your ground"" defense in his case Sanford police did not arrest him until almost two months after the shooting because of the Florida stand your ground rules that require police to have specific evidence to refute a self defense claim in order to arrest someone claiming self defense. That provision of the law ""does a disservice to Floridians because it's so vague"" said Florida Sen. Dwight Bullard a Democrat in an interview Sunday with CBS Miami. The police initially did not have evidence to disprove Zimmerman's self-defense claim said former Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee Jr. It was not until the case drew national attention and a Department of Justice investigation that prosecutors found evidence to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund is urging Attorney General Eric Holder to undertake a review of the case and encouraging Trayvon Martin's family to pursue civil action against Zimmerman. Last year a Florida task force headed by the lieutenant government reviewed the state's ""stand your ground"" law but in a final report the task force only made minor recommendations that required no action from the legislature. No changes were made to the law this year. ""The liberal activists tried to use that tragedy (the shooting death of Trayvon Martin) as an opportunity to take our rights as Americans"" said Florida House Speaker Rep. Will Weatherford a Republican on the attempts to change the state's stand your ground law. ""We stood our ground on Stand Your Ground."" Across the country at least 22 states have ""stand your ground"" laws with varying degrees of requirements for when citizens may use deadly force to protect themselves. Before these new laws were put in place beginning in 2005 people who felt threatened outside their home were required to flee from an attacker before they were allowed to use force to defend themselves. The new laws make clear however that if someone feels threatened either inside or outside their home they do not have to run away and are legally justified in using force to protect themselves. ""If (my family and I) are walking through the mall and someone attacks us I should not have to retreat. I should be able to defend myself in any place or forum that I need to"" said Florida Rep. Carlos Trujillo a Republican on Sunday in an interview with CBS Miami. Some states just allow people to defend themselves in their homes or businesses while others extend the law to cars or any place someone ""has a right to be."" Florida's law falls into this second category. (See chart) The Zimmerman case drew national attention to the ""stand you ground"" laws which were promoted by the National Rifle Association and the American Legislative Exchange Council through model legislation and advocacy. In a study of ""stand your ground"" laws commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research researchers found that in states with ""stand your ground"" laws the number of homicides had significantly increased from the years before the law was enacted. They found that the provision that allows self-defense ""in any place a person has a legal right to be"" is the driver of the increase in homicides. The increase in homicides they argue negates the claim that these laws reduce crime.

Huffington Post,0,[Senate Immigration Bill Passes Out Of Judiciary Committee],"WASHINGTON -- The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bipartisan ""gang of eight"" immigration bill on Tuesday in a 13 to 5 vote after a marathon final day of markup that stretched into the evening.  All Democrats on the committee along with Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and gang of eight Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) voted in favor of the bill which will now go to the Senate floor. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) who voted against the bill out of committee said he would support allowing it to move forward for debate -- rather than joining a filibuster -- once on the Senate floor. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) who was also a ""no"" vote said if it had been between his vote and moving the bill to the Senate floor he would have voted in favor.  The crowd in the room erupted into applause when the final vote tally was read rising to their feet and chanting ""Yes we can!"" then ""Si se puede!""  Democrats seemed equally pleased to vote the bill out of committee.  ""The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform"" Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said before the bill's passage. ""I hope that our history our values and our decency can inspire us finally to take action. We need an immigration system that lives up to American values and helps write the next great chapter in American history by reinvigorating our economy and enriching our communities."" Of 300 amendments offered to the gang of eight immigration bill the committee debated more than 200. The bill came out of months of work from the gang of eight which in addition to Graham and Flake includes Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). It includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants a streamlined legal immigration process tougher interior enforcement and increased border security.  One of the final issues to settle was over high-skilled worker visas called H1-Bs. An amendment that simplifies the process for companies to bring in workers in science technology engineering and math eventually passed on a voice vote. Hatch and Schumer came to a compromise that led Hatch to agree to vote the full bill out of committee although he did not commit to supporting its eventual passage.  It was a tough vote for Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) who has previously been wary of expanding H1-B visas. He voted in favor however citing the need for compromise and to get the bill through.  ""We've made concessions I never thought we'd have to make ... but we've made those concessions to win your support"" Durbin said to Hatch. ""We need your support and we want to pass this bill."" The amendment came under fire from the AFL-CIO labor federation which said the measure would hurt American workers. ""There is no reason why this strong coalition should accept anti-worker amendments"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""And let's be clear: Senator Orrin Hatch's H-1B amendments are unambiguous attacks on American workers.""  Some measures praised highly by immigrant rights advocates never went to a vote. Leahy brought up his amendment to allow LGBT couples equal protection under immigration law but withdrew it ""with a heavy heart"" when it became clear Democrats were willing to drop it so the bill would pass. A number of provisions lauded by advocates did make it in. The committee voted on Monday to approve Blumenthal's amendment that would block immigration raids in sensitive areas such as schools hospitals and places of worship except in extreme circumstances. A separate Blumenthal measure to restrict the use of solitary confinement in immigrant detention also passed on Monday also on a voice vote.  Although many Republican amendments failed some GOP senators such as Hatch were more successful than others. The committee voted on Monday to require a mandatory biometric exit system at airports with the highest volume of international air travel -- something Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) wanted to do nationwide but without success.  Amendments deemed poison pills failed unsurprisingly. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) attempted to add a change that would strip the bill of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants which is considered absolutely necessary to the bill by President Barack Obama Democrats and some Republicans. Five Republicans voted for that amendment while three -- Hatch Graham and Flake -- joined Democrats in opposing it.  Leahy said the amendment would gut the bill while Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said ""it goes against everything America stands for."" Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) similarly disparaged another failed Cruz amendment this one to bar currently undocumented immigrants from ever being eligible for welfare benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps saying he doesn't think such an America is one he'd want to live in.  Sessions was also unsuccessful in his efforts to amend the bill offering 49 amendments and seeing nearly every one that went for a vote fail. On one amendment last week Sessions was the sole ""yes"" vote with all of his Republican colleagues abandoning him in his effort to limit legal immigration.  Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) was one of the rare Democrats to offer an amendment that the gang of eight took down. Schumer and Durbin told her they had to reluctantly oppose her attempt on Tuesday to add a change that would expand family visas so that people in extreme hardship could petition for green cards for their adult children or siblings. It failed with 7 votes in support and 11 against including Democrats Schumer Durbin and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) all of whom said it was a good amendment but would upset the delicate balance of the gang of eight bill.  ""Your heart's in the right place your amendment's in the wrong place"" Durbin said to Hirono. President Barack Obama applauded the committee for passing the bill. ""None of the Committee members got everything they wanted and neither did I but in the end we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line"" he said in a statement. ""I encourage the full Senate to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor at the earliest possible opportunity and remain hopeful that the amendment process will lead to further improvements."" Now that the bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee it has to go to the Senate floor where gang of eight members are hopeful it will pass. Schumer and McCain who is not on the Judiciary Committee have said they would like to win over a majority of both parties -- around 70 votes in total."
Washington Post,0,[Don’t let DOMA fool you — the Supreme Court is restricting your rights],David Cole is a professor of constitutional law and criminal justice at Georgetown University Law Center and a fellow at the Open Society Foundation.  The Supreme Court’s 5 to 4 decision to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act was undeniably historic a victory not just for gay rights advocates but for anyone committed to advancing equal rights in America.  It was also an anomaly.  For all the celebration Wednesday — and who will forget the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washingtonsinging the national anthem outside the court? — the underlying theme of the Supreme Court’s term was not the recognition of rights but their dilution. Time and again in closely divided decisions on issues as disparate as antitrust law privacy and discrimination the court either watered down rights or made it difficult or impossible to enforce them effectively. (Unless of course you are a white college applicant challenging affirmative action.)  In two cases the justices made it impossible for plaintiffs alleging serious violations of federal law even to have their claims heard. In Clapper v. Amnesty International the court denied a constitutional challenge to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 which vastly expanded the National Security Agency’s surveillance powers. This law authorizes the recently disclosed surveillance programs which involve the interception of international e-mails phone conversations and social-network communications. The act permits surveillance without having to show that the target is suspected of anything thereby jettisoning the bedrock requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs in Clapper included lawyers human rights advocates and journalists all of whom communicated frequently with people overseas whom the government was likely to be targeting under the statute and therefore had to take expensive and burdensome measures to preserve the confidentiality of their communications.   With a majority comprised of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. Anthony M. Kennedy Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs’ claims could not be heard because they could not show that they had actually been subjected to the surveillance. The catch: The surveillance is conducted in secret so no one can be certain that he or she is subject to it. In a second case  American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant  the same five justices ruled that corporations can insulate themselves from liability for violating federal law by inserting clauses in their contracts that prohibit class-action arbitration. A group of small merchants argued that American Express had violated antitrust laws by using its monopoly power to charge credit card fees 30 percent higher than those of its competitors. But American Express had used the same monopoly power to draft a form contract that directed all legal disputes into arbitration — and then forbade arbitration on a class-wide basis. The merchants argued that because antitrust claims are so expensive to prove they are not worth pursuing on an individual basis and can be vindicated only through collective class-wide proceedings. The Supreme Court previously ruled that contracts may require arbitration rather than court litigation only if the arbitration proceeding provides an adequate forum for individuals to vindicate their rights. In Italian Colors the court’s majority conceded that requiring individual arbitrations would make it too expensive to challenge American Express’s conduct but as Justice Elena Kagan paraphrased the majority’s response in her dissent: “Too darn bad.” In three other closely divided decisions the court’s conservative justices made equality rights decidedly harder to enforce. In Shelby County v. Holder the court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required select states with a history of discrimination to clear any changes in their voting arrangements with the federal government ahead of time by showing that the changes would not dilute the rights of minority voters. This preclearance requirement was the most effective part of the law because it prevented discriminatory actions from taking effect in the first place rather than requiring victims to later sue in court where challenges are often so expensive and time-consuming that they cannot adequately address many discriminatory voting practices. The court previously upheld the preclearance requirement four times but on Tuesday the conservative majority broke with years of precedent and concluded that the rights of states are more important than the equal voting rights of minority citizens. In a pair of less-noticed decisions released the day before Shelby County the court once again by 5 to 4votes issued employer-friendly worker-hostile interpretations of Title VII the section of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in employment. In both cases the court rejected long-standing interpretations of the law by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar the court imposed a more demanding standard on “retaliation” claims brought when an employer responds to a discrimination complaint by punishing the employee for raising the issue. And in Vance v. Ball State University the court narrowed the definition of “supervisors” under Title VII thereby reducing employers’ responsibility for racial and sexual harassment in the workplace. Title VII says employers are more responsible for harassment from supervisors than from co-workers and the EEOC had sensibly defined “supervisor” as a person with the authority to direct another’s daily work. But the court’s conservatives limited “supervisors” to those who have the formal authority to hire fire and grant or deny promotions a much narrower group. The ruling means that victims of harassment by supervisors who lack such formal authority will be significantly less protected. The justices also curtailed our rights against the police. In Maryland v. King the court ruled that the state can take DNA samples from arrestees without a warrant or any basis for suspicion. It reasoned that DNA samples like fingerprints are taken for identification purposes not to investigate a crime and so don’t have to meet the “individualized suspicion” standard that applies to investigatory searches. But as Justice Scalia pointed out in a dissent joined by Justices Kagan Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg DNA samples are not taken to identify arrestees but to investigate whether they are responsible for some other crime. The practice of taking DNA samples if strictly limited to identifying characteristics and not used to determine an individual’s genetic traits may seem reasonable enough as the intrusion is minor. But allowing sweeping searches without individualized suspicion runs contrary to the court’s long-standing Fourth Amendment rules. Meanwhile in Salinas v. Texas the court’s conservative majority ruled paradoxically that Americans’ right to remain silent won’t be protected unless they speak up. The court decided that if someone refuses to answer potentially incriminating questions it’s perfectly permissible for the state to use that refusal in a criminal trial as long as the questions were asked outside the trial or an interrogation in custody. The result is that individuals who believe they have a right to remain silent (having been so informed by countless television shows) and exercise it will be punished for doing so. Of course the high court was not uniformly hostile to individual rights. In addition to striking down the Defense of Marriage Act’s limits on federal marriage benefits it also gave a partial victory to Abigail Fisher a white applicant who challenged the University of Texas’s affirmative action plan; in that case the court compromised concluding that the lower courts had not subjected the university’s plan to sufficient scrutiny and sent the case back for further review. But of course that ruling issued in the name of equal protection actually limits efforts to remove barriers for minorities. The larger pattern is clear: This term the Roberts court regularly favored restricting people’s rights or more insidiously limiting their ability to enforce those rights. Almost all these rulings were 5 to 4 decisions most divided along familiar ideological lines. The close votes reflect the fact that there were reasonable arguments to be made on both sides. But courts play an essential role in safeguarding individual rights and in this term the Supreme Court repeatedly did the opposite. Congress could of course fix many of the problems through legislation — but leaving the protection of individual rights to a polarized and partisan institution offers cold comfort.
Fox News,0,"[ObamaCare in Trouble? Exchange provision delayed, as lawmakers push to repeal another]","Latest setback for landmark legislation ""Lots of small businesses struggle with providing insurance for their workers so this was supposed to facilitate it and make it easier for small business to do this"" said Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. ""It was a huge portion of the sale job. When they passed the law in 2010 there were many senators and members of Congress who were saying 'I am doing this because it's going to help small businesses.'"" The exchanges were designed to give workers a range of choices supported by dollars from their employers. But now they will have only one choice until 2015 which could mean they can't shop for insurance that includes their current providers. Capretta said the administration is ""way"" behind schedule. Since insurance is more expensive for small businesses many of which have no obligation under the law to provide coverage analysts now fear many might just stop trying and let workers go on the soon-to-be-launched state exchanges. Sara Teppema of the Society of Actuaries -- which did an exhaustive study of ObamaCare -- said that ""even if it's just a small change of people who are leaving the employment-based insurance and coming into the individual insurance market their costs and their numbers will overwhelm those who are currently uninsured."" That means costs would increase. Meanwhile 79 senators including several liberal lawmakers recently voted to repeal a new tax on medical devices contained in the health care law following a similar vote in the House. ""The House and the Senate agreeing? This is a harmonic convergence it doesn't happen"" said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ""But on this it's happened because the adverse consequences to our economy and the quality of health care are so apparent."" The two separate votes have not become law but show widespread opposition to the 2.3 percent sales tax on medical devices. Critics say the law is unfair to the industry since it's a tax on gross sales -- meaning it adds up to a much bigger percentage of a company's profits. But supporters such as Paul Van de Water of the Center for American Progress oppose any repeal. ""I think that repealing the device tax would be irresponsible. We need the revenue and it's not going to be a job killer"" he said. The theory was that ObamaCare would insure 30 million more people and that device makers like pharmaceutical companies would get lots of new customers and a steady stream of new revenue to make up for the tax. Van de Water predicted that would still happen. ""These device manufacturers are for the most part going to be getting a large increase in business thanks to health reform thanks to ObamaCare"" he said.  But the CEO of one company said that's not true for the 7000 small companies with 400000 employees who make a wide range of devices. Christine Jacobs of Theragenics said: ""We make widgets -- hips knees stents pacemakers and implants even for prostate cancer. Those widgets tend to be used by people that are elderly. As the body parts wear out we're needed."" But Jacobs notes that most people whose body parts wear out are already on Medicare so ObamaCare does not provide a new revenue stream for her company -- only financial pain. ""In the case of a small company that medical device tax is equal to our R-and-D budget for this year"" Jacobs said. Bayh said in his own state of Indiana one company planned to open up to five facilities over the next five years but had to scrap those plans because of the ""uncertainty created by this tax."" Jacobs said the huge multinational device makers might be able to handle the burden but not the small companies. ""It's just such a disproportionate burden for little guys"" she said. ""Because we're all being told that it's the little companies that create the jobs. And that's not message that we're getting."" The tax will even be applied to sutures used on pets that Theragenics developed for the veterinary market. She sought FDA approval to demonstrate the quality of her products. But now she said ""it's hard for me not to get frosted on this one"" -- she explained that whoever wrote the regulations said ""if you have FDA approval you will be taxed.""  President Obama has vowed to veto any repeal of the tax but Bayh notes that 79 votes in the Senate would be more than enough to override any veto."
Breitbart,0,[Exclusive: Immigration Agents Rip House Lawmakers Pushing Amnesty],In a public statement that will be released Thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release USCIS Council president Kenneth Palinkas warned that Goodlatte (pictured) House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-VA) House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) seem to be following the same pathway that Senate “Gang of Eight” members did regarding how they are working on immigration legislation.  “At every step this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation’s security and the American taxpayer” Palinkas said. “I documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven S. 744 only to have them ignored.  “I worry the House may be following a similar path. Media reports reveal that Chairman Bob Goodlatte Chairman Paul Ryan Congressman Luis Gutierrez and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally in combination with proposals to expand visa programs.” Palinkas warned too that any group of “step-by-step” House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Gang of Eight members Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and some Republicans have said they want to do.  “These plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency – USCIS – that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card temporary visa and citizenship applications” Palinkas said. “Advancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.” In his statement Palinkas cited a recent MSNBC report where Gutierrez said he Goodlatte and others have worked on a “compromise” position. That MSNBC report also noted that Goodlatte and other Republicans are working with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) another Democrat on a plan to get to conference with the Senate bill. Palinkas stated that USCIS agents have been like they were from the Senate conversations excluded from all discussions among House leaders. “Why aren’t USCIS officers being consulted on this ‘compromise’ offer?” Palinkas asked.  He further expressed concern over Cantor’s GOP DREAM Act tentatively called the KIDS act. “I am also worried about the arguments being used to support the KIDS Act one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted” Palinkas said. “Legislators including Mr. Cantor and Mr. Goodlatte have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens. But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?”  He warned that the KIDS Act may lead down a slippery slope. “This seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries” Palinkas asserted. “Should we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?” Palinkas alleged that under the Obama administration USCIS has been riddled with nefarious activities. “At USCIS our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House” he said.  He finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped House Republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to: “USCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits. This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews the failure of our software system the lack of training and office space and pressure to rubber-stamp applications. We have become an approval machine” “Failure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits” “Administrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who under law are not properly eligible” “Approval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them” “A management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals not US citizens and taxpayers as the customer. We believe in treating all with respect and always will but our agency’s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.” Goodlatte Ryan and Cantor are not the only Republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. According to the Miami Herald Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) said about immigration: “We have to address it. It’s a moral issue.” In addition according to Politico House GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for House Republicans this year.  This coming weekend on Univision McMorris Rodgers will say that House Speaker John Boehner “over the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the House moving forward on immigration reform. I believe that we have a window here between now and the end of the year and that this is a priority.” McMorris Rodgers is the fourth highest-ranking member in the House GOP conference.

BBC,0,[Cispa bill on cyber security passed by the US House],"The US House of Representatives has passed the controversial Cyber Information Sharing and Protection Act.  Cispa is designed to help combat cyberthreats by making it easier for law enforcers to get at web data. This is the second time Cispa has been passed by the House. Senators threw out the first draft saying it did not do enough to protect privacy. Cispa could fail again in the Senate after threats from President Obama to veto it over privacy concerns. A substantial majority of politicians in the House backed the bill. The law is passing through the US legislative system as American federal agencies warn that malicious hackers motivated by money or acting on behalf of foreign governments such as China are one of the biggest threats facing the nation. ""If you want to take a shot across China's bow this is the answer"" said Mike Rogers the Republican politician who co-wrote Cispa and chairs the House Intelligence Committee. Cispa has also secured the backing of several technology firms including the CTIA wireless industry group as well as the TechNet computer industry lobby group which has Google Apple and Yahoo as members. By contrast the social news website Reddit has been vocal in its opposition to the bill. In March Facebook said it no longer supported Cispa. The bill could fail again in the Senate after the Obama administration's threat to use its veto unless changes were made. The White House wants amendments so more is done to ensure the minimum amount of data is handed over in investigations. The American Civil Liberties Union has also opposed Cispa saying the bill was ""fatally flawed"". The Electronic Frontier Foundation Reporters Without Borders and the American Library Association have all voiced similar worries. Cispa's authors say existing amendments have addressed many of the criticisms and more oversight was being given to data before it was handed over."
USA Today,0,[Tampa socialite Jill Kelley: The saga continues],"Justice's delay isn't necessarily justice denied for Jill Kelley the Tampa socialite entangled in the scandal that toppled former CIA director David Petraeus. The Justice Department has asked for a 30-day extension until Sept. 4 to respond to her lawsuit against the government for violating her family's privacy rifling through her e-mails and leaking confidential information about her. And Kelley is fine with the extension says her lawyer Alan Raul. The government says it needs the time to sort through the allegations in the 65-page complaint. It doesn't help Justice Department lawyers say that Pentagon employees have been furloughed because of sequestration. ""We are pleased that the federal government appears to be taking this case seriously and is taking extra time to conduct its internal inquiry in response to this lawsuit"" Raul said in a statement. Kelley had been an unpaid social liaison to the military and had hosted parties for military officials including Petraeus and Gen. John Allen at her home on Tampa's Bayshore Boulevard. The headquarters of Central Command which oversees military action in the Middle East is a few miles away. Petraeus' extramarital affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell was exposed after Kelley complained to the FBI about harassing e-mails she had received. Broadwell was behind them. Allen's name also popped up in Kelley's e-mails. That prompted then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to call for an investigation of Allen's relationship with Kelley to determine if there had been ""professional misconduct"" on his part. Allen and Kelley say there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship. The Pentagon inspector general agreed although the Defense Department refuses to release its findings. USA TODAY and other news organizations have filed multiple requests for the report but have been denied. Allen and Kelley exchanged 3000 e-mails from July 2010 to July 2012 according to Rep. Jackie Speier the California Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. She was briefed by the inspector general on the report but not shown the document. Of those e-mails 41 were reviewed more thoroughly Speier was told. Speier wants Allen to divulge e-mails from his private account to Kelley. He refused to provide them to the inspector general Speier said. Kelley and her husband Scott want an apology and unspecified damages for what they say were willful leaks by federal officials of false and damaging information about them. Those officials should have been protecting them and their privacy they say in their lawsuit. ""The Kelleys are trying to deter the government from violating the privacy rights of other Americans by calling attention to the government's profound over-collection of private e-mails and egregious leaking of confidential investigative material"" Raul said."
New York Times,0,"[Senate Confirms a Judge, but Rancor Remains]",WASHINGTON — Frustrations in the Senate over the slow pace of approval for President Obama’s second-term cabinet deepened Thursday even as the Senate voted 97 to 0 to confirm Mr. Obama’s nominee for a long-vacant seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That vote to confirm the nominee Sri Srinivasan which was added to the calendar at the last minute after Republicans dropped objections that would have delayed it two more weeks came as Senator Mitch McConnell the Republican leader took to the Senate floor to denounce Democrats.  Mr. McConnell directed most of his anger at Senator Harry Reid of Nevada the majority leader accusing him of trying to jam the nomination through and force a rule change that would limit the minority party’s ability to block nominations. “What I fear is the majority leader is working his way toward breaking his word to the Senate and to the American people and blowing up this institution” Mr. McConnell said. “He wants to have no debate” he continued. “ ‘Do what I say when I say it. Sit down shut up. Or we’ll change the rules. We’ll break the rules to change the rules.’ ” Both parties were closely watching Mr. Srinivasan’s path to confirmation as a test case for other high-profile Obama nominations to come. The court on which he will serve is considered the most important in the country after the Supreme Court and often decides cases involving government regulations and the power of federal agencies. Its judges have become Supreme Court justices.  But Thursday’s vote resolved only one of several messy confirmation battles that are brewing. With other nominations in the pipeline that Republicans have threatened to delay — including those to head the Labor Department and the Environmental Protection Agency — Democrats are discussing rewriting Senate rules to prevent Republicans from forcing a 60-vote supermajority on cabinet-level nominees a procedure that before this year had been used just twice in nearly 100 years. But the politics of such a move are dangerous Democrats concede. The Senate is soon to start considering an immigration bill that will need considerable Republican support to succeed. And Democrats seem at least for the time being unwilling to sacrifice immigration overhaul in a fight over the filibuster. “I’m going to do nothing to interfere with immigration” Mr. Reid said Thursday echoing the sentiment of many of his members that a rules change could not happen until after immigration was dealt with. To that end Mr. Reid will postpone scheduling votes on the president’s more controversial pending nominees. An alternative possibility is that a bipartisan group of senators could try to reach a deal on the filibuster themselves that way averting a confrontation that would further strain the already distrustful relationship between the two parties. Republicans have threatened to filibuster several Obama appointees. Among them: Gina McCarthy the president’s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency on the ground that she was not forthcoming in responding to their written questions. (They sent her nearly 1100.) The nomination of Thomas E. Perez for labor secretary is in peril because Republicans view his work as head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division as too political. They have vowed to block Mr. Obama’s pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Richard Cordray because they object on principle to the existence of such a bureau. And nominees to the National Labor Relations Board are meeting similar obstacles. “There may be some that we really have a fight over” said Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina saying a drawn-out argument over nominations could do considerable harm to the Senate. “So that’s when we have to think this thing through” he added saying he would support reopening talks with Democrats over changing the rules on filibusters. “If it becomes a problem and we get hung up over cabinet nominees yes I’d be willing to.” There does appear to be one bright spot for the administration: the nomination of Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary. Ms. Pritzker a Chicago businesswoman who was a top fund-raiser for Mr. Obama appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday and met little resistance from Republicans. But even a relatively gentle confirmation process for Ms. Pritzker is unlikely to resolve the bigger differences between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans point out that they have approved the majority of Mr. Obama’s nominees. But the new lengths to which they have gone to slow down confirmation — including the first-ever filibuster of a defense secretary nominee and requests that nominees respond to hundreds of written questions — have made the process highly contentious. Senator Mary Landrieu Democrat of Louisiana said that after the Senate voted on immigration changes she would support efforts to broker a compromise on the use of the filibuster.  “It might be a good time to sit down and talk about what can be done because it’s really just truly shameful” she said. Ms. Landrieu like Mr. Graham helped negotiate the 2005 pact that limited the use of filibusters on judicial nominees to all but “extraordinary circumstances.” Such an agreement would be welcomed by many Democrats who despite their anger with Republicans are reluctant to force a rule change that could later be used against them. Mr. Reid is confident that a parliamentary ruling would allow him to limit the use of the filibuster on cabinet-level nominees by obtaining a simple 51-vote majority. Usually a two-thirds vote is required for a rules change. But many Democrats worry that they might someday wish for the protections that Senate rules afford to the minority party. “Amazingly enough the American people do from time to time change their minds about who they would like to be running the country” Mr. McConnell said. “The shoe could be on the other foot. You never know when.”
Washington Post,0,[President Obama to meet with head of Delta Sigma Theta sorority],President Obama has invited the president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority to the White House for a Tuesday afternoon meeting ending  months of hope and speculation by leaders of the nation’s largest African American sorority who have been gathered in Washington this past week for their 100th anniversary celebration. White House spokesman Kevin Lewis confirmed that Obama will meet with Cynthia Butler-McIntyre. The conversation will come about two hours before an appearance at the convention by former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton who will speak during the second-to-last day of the convention which has brought more than 40000 members to the District. Although sorority leaders said they are pleased that Obama will meet with Butler-McIntyre many members had hoped that Obama would visit one of the largest conventions  in D.C.’s history. Many members of the sorority expressed disappointment that neither the president nor first lady Michelle Obama would be making an official appearance.  On Monday Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. spoke to the Deltas. In addition to talking about the recent Supreme Court ruling striking down parts of the Voting Rights Act Holder spoke about the shooting of Trayvon Martin and subsequent trial and acquittal of the shooter George Zimmerman. “They suffered a pain that no parent should endure” Holder said of Martin’s parents. Holder said the Justice Department has already launched an investigation as to whether or not Martin’s civil rights were violated. The Rev. Al Sharpton and group of pastors from across the country held a news conference outside the Justice Department on Monday to announce that Florida will be the “battleground” for a new civil rights movement. The Deltas’ conference began last week and will continue through Wednesday. Events have included a step show an ecumenical service a social-action luncheon a gospel concert and the dedication of a stained-glass window — depicting African American women — at Howard University’s Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel.
LA Times,1,[ Chasm divides gun control and gun rights advocates ],SACRAMENTO — “Living in parallel universes” is how Senate leader Darrell Steinberg describes it. Gun control and gun rights advocates “talking past each other.” Emanating from different cultures incapable of agreeing on how to make us all safer from firearms. Their opposite views were in full voice last week in the Legislature during a marathon 10-hour committee hearing — longest anyone could remember — on gun bills. Unlike in Washington where gun control forces couldn’t muster enough strength in the U.S. Senate to pass legislation expanding background checks a state Senate committee in Sacramento approved eight bills to strengthen California’s already stringent firearms regulations. Unfortunately without universal background checks nationwide — not only in gun stores which already is the law but at gun shows and via the Internet — California is vulnerable to Wild-West dealing in other states.Advertisement Criminals and mental misfits can buy virtually any weapon they want at a Nevada or Arizona gun show and cart it into California circumventing this state’s tough background checks. Actually in Washington there was solid majority support for expanding background checks — 55 Senate votes. But because of that chamber’s arcane rules born of undemocratic filibusters the bill needed 60 or a 60% supermajority. In Sacramento where Democrats overwhelmingly rule most gun legislation can be passed on a simple majority vote. One exception is a bill to speed up the confiscation of guns from Californians who bought them legally but later were disqualified because of a violent crime a restraining order or mental illness. There are roughly 20000 people possessing around 40000 firearms who aren’t supposed to have them. The bill SB 140 by Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) requires a two-thirds vote in each legislative house. It would appropriate $24 million to hire enough agents to seize the weapons. But despite opposition by the gun lobby — it objects to using money from background check fees paid by gun buyers — the measure has been sailing through the Legislature. It passed the Assembly 57-10 last week with only Republicans voting “no.” This bill however offers a clear example of political polarization in the Capitol. Republicans proposed a perfectly sensible amendment that would have required all the illegal weapons to be confiscated in one year rather than over three as mandated by the bill. Democrats quickly tabled the amendment cutting off debate. “If we’re going to be serious about dealing with felons with guns then we need to take advantage of the money and make it a priority” Assemblyman Donald Wagner (R-Irvine) the amendment’s author told me. “A lot of folks on my GOP side want to do something. They don’t want to just be saying ‘no.’ But they didn’t even let us debate…. “I won’t say it’s impossible to come together. And I won’t say one side is entirely right and the other is entirely wrong. But both sides need to get beyond their hardened positions of the past.” Hardened positions however dominated the long meeting of the Senate Public Safety Committee. Republicans followed the gun lobby in opposing every measure. Democrats passed all of them on party-line 5-to-2 votes. “There’s a difference between opposing every bill and your saying ‘We would support it if you did this or that’ ” Steinberg a Democrat from Sacramento finally vented to gun lobbyists. “It would help your credibility.” The committee approved bills to: •Prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles that hold detachable magazines. SB 374 Steinberg. The senator called them “mass killing machines.” • Ban even the possession of magazines holding more than 10 rounds. They’re already illegal to buy. SB 396 Sen. Loni Hancock (D-Berkeley). • Require ammunition buyers to pass a background check and obtain a license. SB 53 Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles). • Add repeated alcohol and drug offenses as reasons for denying gun ownership. SB 755 Sen. Lois Wolk (D-Davis). • Require long gun purchasers to pass a written safety test. That’s already required for handgun buyers. SB 683 Sen. Marty Block (D-San Diego). These and other bills passed by the committee perhaps could use some expert tweaking — even gutting — and the gun lobbyists are experts. But they’re such inflexible hard-liners that Democrats ignore them. Just as intransigent were scores of citizens who lined up to emotionally argue for gun rights. They repeatedly voiced two familiar mantras: Gun control laws are unconstitutional because of the 2nd Amendment. And the laws don’t stop gun violence they only harass innocent law-abiding citizens. “My rights are protected by the United States Constitution and not affected by an L.A. Times poll” protested one tea party member referring to a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll that found overwhelming support for stricter gun controls. Countering the constitutional argument Steinberg quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in a 2008 opinion that affirmed the right of individuals to own firearms. “Like most rights” Scalia wrote “the right secured by the 2nd Amendment is not unlimited…. “The right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” As for badgering law-abiding citizens Steinberg noted that four killers in the last five mass shootings had no prior criminal records. And the fifth had been guilty only of a minor offense. Murderers often are law-abiders until they’re not — until they shoot their wife or get fired and mow down former co-workers. Also testifying were long lines of gun control advocates including trauma surgeons and mothers some of whom had lost children to gun fire. Yes these gun combatants are living in parallel universes. And so are Sacramento and Washington. Too bad they can’t figure out how to fire in sync at the same enemy: gun violence. george.skelton@latimes.com

Huffington Post,0,[Darrell Issa On IRS Investigation: Releasing Full Transcripts Now Would Be 'Reckless'],"WASHINGTON -- One week after he released partial transcripts of interviews with IRS officials involved in the scandal surrounding the targeting of conservative groups the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said releasing the full transcripts would be ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible.""  Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back Tuesday against calls to put out more information on the committee's investigation into the controversy sparked after a Treasury Department Inspector General report revealed the IRS had singled out tea party groups applying for nonprofit status for extra scrutiny. Responding specifically to criticism from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) the ranking Democratic member of the committee Issa said that releasing full interviews conducted with IRS employees would hurt the ongoing investigation.  ""Your decision to publicly announce that the investigation should wrap up was irresponsible but not surprising"" said Issa in a letter to Cummings. ""However your push to release entire transcripts from witness interviews while the investigation remains active was reckless and threatened to undermine the integrity of the Committee’s investigation."" The position is a tenuous one for Issa who during an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" just over a week ago promised that the full transcripts would be released. On that same program Issa revealed several partial transcripts that suggested the directive to screen tea party groups came from officials in Washington.  Since then The Huffington Post has sent four emails asking Issa's office when the full transcripts would be made public. Not one was returned. When asked why Issa's release of a partial transcript was fine but he opposed releasing the transcripts in full a spokesman for the congressman referred HuffPost to another statement. “Limited releases of testimony may also serve to empower other witnesses to become whistleblowers and serve to vindicate individuals who have been subjected to criticism or retaliation at the hands of their managers"" said Issa in that statement. ""On the other hand if a full transcript were released it would serve as a roadmap of the Committee’s investigation."" It could take weeks if not months to see the full transcripts should the committee wait to release them until the investigation is completed. According to a Democratic aide on the committee investigators have interviewed five IRS employees so far and have 18 more to go. In addition investigators are hoping to look through hundred of thousands of documents that could shed light on the tax agency's controversial screening practices. Unwilling to allow the partial transcripts Issa released to be the only evidence in the public record Cummings this week also released segments of interviews. In a Sunday memo to his colleagues on the oversight committee the congressman said that a manager in the IRS Cincinnati office who oversaw the nonprofit screening said that no one in Washington ordered him to employ the practice of targeting tea party groups. ""Although the Committee interviewed a self-identified ‘conservative Republican’ who denied any White House involvement or any political motivation for screening Tea Party cases Chairman Issa now appears to be going back on his promise to release the full interview transcripts of IRS employees"" said Cummings in a statement. ""Chairman Issa changes his mind so fast that even when I agree with him we’re not on the same page. I fully support responsible oversight but cherry picking transcript excerpts to fuel partisan and unsubstantiated claims is not a credible or effective way to investigate."" On Tuesday an aide to Cummings said the congressman would release the full transcripts of the already completed interviews by the end of the week if Issa did not do so himself -- though the aide also cautioned that those plans could change.  The squabbling between the chairman and ranking member of the oversight committee has made the conversation surrounding the scandal far more contentious. When news first broke that the IRS had targeted conservative groups there was near bipartisan condemnation of the agency. Over time however politics has entered the debate and Issa's handling of the committee's investigation has been criticized as a poorly disguised attempt to tie the issue to the president.  When Issa called White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a ""paid liar"" earlier this month he was criticized publicly by Democrats and privately by his own party. More recently Republicans have been more open in their concerns about where the investigation is heading.  As Politico reported on Tuesday: Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana a senior Ways and Means Republican who chairs the panel’s Oversight subcommittee criticized Issa’s tactics saying the release of partial transcripts could “adversely alter our ability to get future information from other IRS employees.” “Just simply from a process standpoint you don’t want to do that and alter what others might say” Boustany told POLITICO. “I really am concerned that it could tip this into the political realm rather than a true detailed investigation to get the facts out.” He added: “A lot of this has to be done quietly obviously as we piece together what has happened and once we piece it together and get the firm proof then you can come out” and say what happened.

Huffington Post,2,[Michele Bachmann: IRS Scandal Undermines 2012 Election's 'Credibility'],"Rep.

People can right ask questions about the credibility of the elections."" On Friday the IRS admitted to engaging in ""inappropriate"" targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election. Agents singled out groups with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status as well as organizations that took issue with ""how the country is being run.""  Bachmann said agency claims that no high-level officials were involved with developing the criteria for extra scrutiny are ""laughable.""  “The Obama administration wants us to believe low-level functionaries are the ones responsible for making this decision” she said. “That is impossible laughable. I can tell you within the IRS the agency is very sensitive of jurisdictional authority.""  The Republican congresswoman pointed to the IRS' role in the implementation of Obama's signature health care reform law as another potential area for concern claiming that it is ""reasonable"" to ask whether the agency will ""will deny or delay access to health care"" for conservatives.  ""We learned to our horror in Benghazi it appears that every move that was made was based on politics"" she said. “Now it appears the president was willing to use the most feared agency in the U.S. for his own political purposes.""  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) also tied the IRS scandal to the Affordable Care Act.  ""Obama has a huge problem because Obamacare relies very heavily on the IRS"" Gingrich said during a Monday appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Why would you trust the bureaucracy with your health if you can't trust the bureaucracy with your politics?"""
New York Times,1,[C.I.A.’s History Poses Hurdles for an Obama Nominee],WASHINGTON — John O. Brennan’s first difficult challenge at the C.I.A. may not be confronting the agency’s future but its past. Mr. Brennan whose nomination is expected to be eventually approved by the Senate will take charge at the agency where he worked for 25 years just as it faces a sweeping indictment of its now-defunct interrogation program — a blistering 6000-page Senate study that includes incendiary accusations that agency officials for years systematically misled the White House the Justice Department and Congress about the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding that were used on Qaeda prisoners. By the account of people briefed on the report it concludes that the program was ill-conceived sloppily managed and far less useful in obtaining intelligence than its supporters have claimed. “It’s a potential minefield for John Brennan” said Mark M. Lowenthal a former assistant C.I.A. director and former House Intelligence Committee staff director. The still-classified report by the Senate Intelligence Committee will place Mr. Brennan squarely in the cross-fire between Democratic critics of what they call a morally and practically disastrous experiment in torture and some Republican defenders who say the report is biased and fault President Obama for banning coercive interrogations. And it could place Mr. Brennan in a difficult position inside the agency’s headquarters in suburban Virginia. If he endorses the Senate report he will be criticizing the many C.I.A. officers who worked on the program and challenging the stance of former directors notably George J. Tenet who oversaw the brutal interrogations and Michael V. Hayden who has fervently defended them. “The career work force will be watching” said John A. Rizzo a top agency lawyer for 30 years before retiring in 2009. “Hundreds who were part of the seven-year E.I.T. program — and who still believe it was the right and essential thing to do — are still there” he added referring to enhanced interrogation techniques. The report according to statements from some senators and descriptions from others who have reviewed it documents in exhaustive detail how C.I.A. officials and consultants who ran the program gave top Bush administration officials members of Congress the American public and even their own colleagues — possibly including Mr. Brennan himself — a deeply distorted account of its nature and efficacy. After a bipartisan start in 2009 Republican staff members refused to participate in the writing of the report making the four-year effort largely the work of Democratic committee staff members. The agency missed a Feb. 15 deadline to complete a review of the report which has 35000 footnotes referring to 6 million documents from C.I.A. files. It now appears likely that the response offering the committee any factual corrections or broader judgments will be delayed until Mr. Brennan’s arrival. Because Mr. Obama famously said he preferred to look forward not back at his predecessor’s counterterrorism programs the Senate report is by far the most thorough examination of how the United States came to use nudity cold sleep deprivation stress positions wall-slamming and waterboarding methods it had long condemned as abuse or torture. Mr. Brennan will have to decide whether to support making a redacted version of the interrogation report public as the committee is likely to support after the C.I.A. completes its review and as a United Nations human rights adviser urged this week. Several Democratic senators and at least one Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona who was tortured as a prisoner in North Vietnam have said that a declassified version must be released and Mr. Brennan said he would give the request “serious consideration.” He will have to decide whether to convene what the agency calls an accountability board to recommend punishment for current or former officials accused of mismanaging or misrepresenting the interrogation program. If he tries to keep the peace by dismissing the dispute as history and a distraction from the agency’s current challenges he will face strong resistance from the Senate committee’s Democratic majority and Mr. McCain. But Emile A. Nakhleh a former top C.I.A. analyst on political Islam who once worked for him said Mr. Brennan’s work as Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser intimate knowledge of the agency and blunt style equip him well to handle the task. “It will be challenging but if there’s any person who can take this on it’s Brennan” Mr. Nakhleh said. “He may say some harsh things about the program and some people won’t like it. But the institution will benefit.” In the month since Mr. Brennan’s public confirmation hearing the interrogation issue has been largely overshadowed by disputes over the targeted killings of terrorism suspects that Mr. Brennan has overseen from the White House. On Wednesday the day after the Senate committee approved Mr. Brennan’s nomination in a bipartisan 12-to-3 vote Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky joined by a handful of other senators carried out a filibuster on the nomination protesting the Obama administration’s refusal to rule out drone strikes on American soil in a national emergency. He ended the filibster Thursday morning and approval of the nomination is expected soon. But as the public debate over torture in the movie “Zero Dark Thirty” has shown the interrogation issue still casts a long shadow over the Central Intelligence Agency nearly a decade after the last waterboarding. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV who as the Intelligence Committee’s senior Democrat battled to exercise oversight over the interrogation program in its early years called the new report “the most in-depth and substantive oversight that the committee has undertaken in its entire history” and said it revealed “severe problems at the C.I.A.” Mr. Rockefeller of West Virginia said he had spoken with Mr. Brennan at length about the report’s findings. “I know that he’s as appalled by many of the facts in the report as I am” he said. “John has the expertise knowledge of the workings of the C.I.A. and the will to make sure that nothing similar ever happens again.” But Mr. Brennan has already been caught between opposing partisan currents. Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia the committee’s Republican vice chairman said at Mr. Brennan’s Feb. 7 confirmation hearing that the nominee had told him the report “was not objective” and called it “quote ‘a prosecutor’s brief written with an eye toward finding problems.’ ” If the C.I.A. pronounces the report “wrong” Mr. Chambliss said he hoped Mr. Brennan would be willing to stand up for such a conclusion. For his part Mr. Brennan said at his hearing that if the report’s 350-page executive summary was right he had himself been misinformed about the program. That would be an extraordinary development since he was deputy to the agency’s third-ranking official in 2002 and 2003 when the program was at its height. He has said that he had no role in running the program and that he expressed disapproval of the brutal methods privately to unidentified colleagues. “I don’t know what the facts are or the truth is. So I really need to look at that carefully and see what C.I.A.'s response is” he said. “What I’m most interested in is finding out what went wrong — if this report is as stated accurate what went wrong in the system where there were systemic failures where there was mismanagement or inaccurate information” Mr. Brennan said. “I would need to get my arms around that and that would be one of my highest priorities if I were to go to the agency.”
Fox News,0,"[Labor secretary nominee accused of cutting 'secret deal,' costing taxpayers up to $200M]","President Barack Obama talks with his nominee for Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez during an announcement Monday March 18 2013 in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  The allegations are highly unusual though are already being disputed by congressional Democrats. Perez is not a favorite of congressional Republicans and the charges could impact his pending confirmation hearing -- scheduled for this Thursday. The report obtained in advance by Fox News claimed Perez in February 2012 ""manipulated"" federal law as assistant attorney general and ""pushed the limits of justice to make this deal happen."" Both cases involved the city of St. Paul. The 67-page report states that the Justice Department's decision to opt out of the whistleblower cases potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million -- the amount the government could have won had it pursued damages in the case. But according to the report the Justice Department stayed away from that case in order to get the city to drop an appeal to the Supreme Court on another matter. The department was allegedly concerned that the high court in the course of reviewing that case would strike down a major element of civil rights enforcement. ""Perez simply could not allow the Court to rule"" the report said. ""Perez sought leverage to stop the city from pressing its appeal."" The case the Justice Department was allegedly concerned about was St. Paul's appeal to the Supreme Court on a case in which property owners said the city made extraordinary efforts through strict code enforcement to condemn their properties. The owners said reducing the amount of affordable housing for minorities violated the federal Fair Housing Act -- by what is known as ""disparate impact."" Perez appeared to think the Supreme Court overturning the case would have been a severe blow to civil rights enforcement the report concluded. The ""disparate impact"" provision which the report described as legally questionable prohibits housing policies that end up discriminating against certain groups even if those policies are not blatantly discriminatory. ""Perez sought facilitated and consummated this deal because he feared that the Court would find disparate impact unsupported by the text of the Fair Housing Act"" the report said. The other end of the alleged deal was for the Justice Department not to get involved in cases against the city of St. Paul that alleged the city received millions in Department of Housing and Urban Development funds -- including stimulus money -- but failed to file the requisite paperwork regarding the hiring of low-income workers. In that case which also involved the city of Minneapolis plaintiff Thomas Newell got neither the backing of the agency nor the Justice Department and lost the case which if won would likely have resulted in the cities repaying tens of millions in damages. The Obama administration has acknowledged that senior Justice Department attorneys recommended intervening in the case and characterized the False Claims Act infractions reported by Newell as ""particularly egregious."" However they thought the case would be ""quite weak and never should have been a serious candidate for intervention"" according to the report. The Justice Department claims everything was above board -- and that the department held three staff briefings heard 24 hours of additional testimony and reviewed 1400 pages of documents before deciding not to intervene. ""The litigation decisions made by the department were in the best interests of the United States and were consistent with the department's legal ethical and professional responsibility obligations"" the department said in a statement. Former Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler also questioned the use of the term ""quid pro quo"" to describe what happened. ""It's such a loaded term"" she said. ""I think in fact you have almost everybody agreeing nothing inappropriate happened."" The report -- subtitled ""How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez manipulated Justice and Ignored Rule of Law"" -- was a joint effort by minority leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Republican-led House's Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees. ""The facts surrounding this quid pro quo show that Perez may have exceeded the scope of the ethics and professional-responsibility opinions he received from the department and thereby violated his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the United States. Perez also misled senior Justice Department officials about the quid pro quo"" the report states. But congressional Democrats put out a statement and memo of their own late Sunday refuting the details. The statement said the ""overwhelming evidence"" indicates Perez and others ""acted professionally to advance the interests of civil rights and effectively combat the scourge of discrimination in housing."" They said the decision not to intervene in the suit against St. Paul was based on expert recommendations. ""Instead of identifying inappropriate conduct by Mr. Perez it appears that the accusations against him are part of a broader political campaign to undermine the legal safeguards against discrimination that Mr. Perez was protecting"" they said."
Huffington Post,1,[New Democrat Coalition Issues Ultimatum On Immigration Reform],"WASHINGTON -- Moderate Democrats working to gather support from Republicans for comprehensive immigration reform sent an ultimatum Friday to Speaker John Boehner: introduce a bill by Sept. 30 or they'll introduce their own.  ""We are frustrated that there was not a bipartisan immigration reform bill introduced prior to the August recess"" reads the letter from 39 members of the New Democrat Coalition a 53-member group including co-chairmen Reps. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.). ""Therefore we write to inform you that if a bipartisan immigration reform package is not introduced in the House of Representatives -- one that includes a pathway to citizenship helps grow American jobs and fixes our immigration system once and for all -- by September 30th we as New Democrats will consider introducing a comprehensive immigration reform bill"" the letter continues. Read the letter here. Boehner an Ohio Republican has said he will not bring up any immigration bill -- particularly the one that passed the Senate in June -- unless a majority of House Republicans support it. Democrats and pro-reform activists think they could get the 218 votes needed for passage of comprehensive immigration reform if Boehner would allow for a vote by keeping most Democrats and winning over some Republicans.  Members of Congress leave town Friday for the August recess a month-long break during which they will hear from constituents. Meanwhile the clock is ticking closer to primaries and the 2014 election year.  Democrats have said immigration reform should include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants but many Republicans have said it's a no-go. Instead House Republicans are pursuing a number of smaller bills such as border security legislation. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) are working on a bill to legalize undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children but there aren't GOP-led efforts to deal with their parents. A seven-member bipartisan group in the House is working on comprehensive legislation with a path to citizenship though it has not yet come to a final agreement on legislative language. The New Democrat Coalition letter says Boehner ""can rely on"" its members for support if he brings up a bill with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. “We have the support of the American people"" it concludes. ""We hope we can count on your support."""
BBC,3,[John Kerry: Some NSA spying went too far],"US Secretary of State John Kerry has said that in some cases US spying has gone too far.  Mr Kerry is the most senior Obama administration official to have commented directly on an issue that has upset America's European allies. He said he will work with the president to prevent further inappropriate acts by the National Security Agency. His comments come as Asian countries have protested at claims that Australia was involved in a US-led spy network. China has demanded an explanation of the reports while Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador to Jakarta. In other developments:  Major technology companies including Google Apple and Yahoo have called for the US government to do more to rein in the NSA's activities.A German MP said ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden is willing to travel to Berlin to help investigations into the alleged surveillance of Angela Merkel's phone.Indonesia's foreign minister said reports that the NSA used Australian embassies to eavesdrop on Asian countries would indicate a ""serious breach"" of diplomatic rules. In his comments Mr Kerry also defended the need for increased surveillance saying it had thwarted terrorist attacks. ""We have actually prevented airplanes from going down buildings from being blown up and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans"" Mr Kerry told a conference in London via video link. ""I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process but there's an effort to try to gather information. And yes in some cases it has reached too far inappropriately. ""And the president our president is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse... we are going to make sure that does not happen in the future."" he said.  Mr Kerry in his remarks to a conference organised by the Open Government Partnership said that while some surveillance may have been excessive claims that up to 70 million were being monitored were an ""exaggeration"". Claims about the extent of US surveillance of targets such as European leaders have strained Washington's diplomatic relations with some of its key allies. Last week it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been tapped for up to 10 years.  More recently there have been claims that the NSA hacked links connecting data centres operated by Google and Yahoo. According to the Sydney Morning Herald Australia embassies in Asia had been used to spy on Asian countries such as China Indonesia Singapore Thailand and Vietnam. ""If confirmed such action is not only a breach of security but also a serious breach of diplomatic norms and ethics"" Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said. The report describes a signals intelligence programme called Stateroom which involves the interception of radio telecommunications and internet traffic using equipment in US British Australian and Canadian diplomatic missions.  Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade declined to comment on the latest reports.  Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: ""Every Australian governmental agency every Australian official... operates in accordance with the law."" The claims are the latest to emerge from documents leaked by ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia and is wanted in the US in connection with the unauthorised disclosures. In Germany a member of parliament has said Mr Snowden is willing to travel to Berlin to help investigate allegations about the tapping of Mrs Merkel's phone. Hans-Christian Stroebele who represents the opposition Green party said there would need to be safeguards against Mr Snowden who he recently visited in Moscow being deported to the United States.  The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said Germany's Christian-Democrat-led government may be unwilling to invite Mr Snowden to the country particularly as his presence would raise issues over extradition agreements with the United States. In the wake of the claims about surveillance of online data centres six major technology companies have called for the US government to do more to control the NSA's activities. The six called for ""appropriate oversight and accountability"" in a letter sent to a US Senate committee sponsoring a bill designed to rein in the NSA.

Whatever the reason the President leaked his unhappiness with Bibi to Goldberg just a few days before the Israeli election–whether in an effort to influence the vote against Bibi serve payback to Bibi for a perceived preference for Romney or because the President could simply no longer suppress his dissatisfaction–it must indeed be unnerving to be the most powerful man on earth and have the elected leader of a tiny Middle Eastern country defy you. Especially when that country in your opinion owes you so much!  You are their only reliable friend who watches helplessly as that little nation continues to isolate itself through its self-destructive policies. According to Goldberg Obama has “become inured to what he sees as self-defeating policies of his Israeli counterpart…Obama said privately and repeatedly “Israel doesn’t know what its own best interests are… Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.” If only Israel would recognize the President’s genius. If only it would stop building in Jerusalem and E1 and allow the President to sprinkle his magic peace dust then Hamas would beat its rockets into ploughshares and Hezbollah would turn its bombs into pruning hooks. But no. Ungrateful to the last Bibi insists on disobeying the President and claiming all of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capitol. No doubt the President is likewise mystified at the Israeli people as well. How could the polls show that they will this week re-elect the intransigent Prime Minister who is doing so much to harm their country? The most powerful man on earth is reduced to watching from the sidelines and complaining to journalists that he knows how to protect Israel far better than the Israelis themselves. Such an ungrateful nation. And yet perhaps the Israelis have finally figured out that they are a sovereign people whom while immensely grateful to America for its friendship and support are still best qualified to judge their security needs better than anyone else. Perhaps they have come to understand that another Democratic president named Bill Clinton whom noone would argue has a sincere love of the Jewish people and a Jewish son-in-law still pushed Israel into the Oslo agreements that left a thousand Israeli civilians blown to bits. Perhaps they have come to understand that if Chuck Hagel President Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense was correct that as a legislator from Nebraska he was “not an Israeli senator. I’m a United States senator” then the Prime Minister of Israel is the likewise the leader of the Jewish state who must put the security of the Israeli people even before a nod of approval from the President of the United States. Over the past four years Bibi has grown into one of Israel’s greatest ever leaders. The country is booming economically and in terms of security. Cranes dot the skyline of expanding Israeli cities terror incidents are negligible compared to the Clinton era and unlike the anemic American economy Israel is humming along at about four percent annual growth. And if President Obama is right that in spite of this prosperity Israel is isolated in world opinion then it is arguably no more so than it has been in the past and besides what is better a popular Israel riddled with dead Jews or an unpopular Israel filled with living ones? But what President Obama does not understand about Netanyahu is that the inflexibility he accuses him of is born not of a narrow-minded obstinacy but rather of a confident Jewish pride and deep-seated conviction that has been Bibi’s lifelong hallmark. In my desire in 1990 to launch a robust response to anti-Israel speeches at the Oxford Union I booked Netanyahu to lecture at the University. Bibi just 41 years old had already electrified the world as Israel’s most capable defender at the UN. Bibi agreed to come with a single stipulation: “If I’m already making the trip then work me like a horse.” We obliged. We picked him up in a special branch police car and as we drove through the grandeur of Oxford’s ancient center he commented on the majesty of British academia and its incongruence with some of the petty anti-Israel sentiment that is often expressed within its halls. Arriving at St. Antony’s College for a private forum with Oxford Middle East experts Bibi put one foot on a chair and for the next 90 minutes held forth on the justice of Israel’s cause surrounded as it was by nation’s sworn to its destruction. As he finished the attacks came in fast and furious in what had to be one of the most hostile audiences he ever addressed. He did not blink he did not flinch he did not bend. When the last question ended he turned to me to ask what next. After two more speeches we took him to my home where we had arranged a dinner with Rhodes Scholars many of them Jewish most critical of Israeli policy. This time Bibi was softer in presentation but just as firm in conviction. Israel was a righteous nation focused on maintaining democracy and human rights while facing existential threats on nearly every border. He spoke to the students of their responsibility to be proud defenders of their people and never bend in the face of opposition. The climax of the day was a lecture at the Union itself. Palestinian and Jewish protesters rallied outside in their hundreds with the rallying cry: “Net-an-ya-hu you should know we support the P-L-O.” Bibi left his security bubble and walked over to the protesters. “Come inside and listen. Then you can protest. I’ll answer every question you ask.” Many left their barricades and joined the large crowd inside. What followed was one of the great speeches I have heard a mesmerizing presentation of the need for democracy across the Middle East and the liberalization of Arab governments that deny their citizens their God-given human rights. At its high point Bibi said “Many of us in Israel have buried children and lost brothers in fulfillment of a simple dream for Jews to finally live and prosper in a country of their own in peace.” He did not have to mention whom he was referring to as even his detractors knew of Entebbe and the hero-brother he had lost. Again he was bombarded with hostile questions. He responded patiently but forcefully. When he finished he was given a standing ovation by most of the students in the hall. It was a night few of us would forget. No Israeli Prime Minister has ever been as American as Bibi. And yet no Prime Minister has so successfully resisted the pressure from the leader of a country he loves so much for a country he loves even more. And the Israeli people in supporting Bibi regardless of the absence of a stamp of approval from President Obama are finally realizing that Israel cannot ultimately be protected from Washington but Jerusalem especially when the current American Administration is not in step with the strong sympathy of the American people for a tiny and just nation fighting for its life.

New York Times,0,"[Republicans Expand I.R.S. Inquiry, With Eye on White House]",WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans not resting with the Internal Revenue Service scandal are moving to broaden the matter to an array of tax malfeasances and “intimidation tactics” they hope will ensnare the White House. Republican charges range from clearly questionable actions to seemingly specious allegations and they grow by the day. On Friday lawmakers sought to tie the I.R.S. matter to the carrying out of President Obama’s health care law which will rely heavily on the agency. Whether they succeed holds significant ramifications for Mr. Obama who will soon know if he is dealing with a late spring thunderstorm that may soon blow over or a consuming squall that will leave lasting damage. Representative Dave Camp Republican of Michigan the usually mild-mannered chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee set the tone Friday at Congress’s first hearing on the targeting of conservative groups by the I.R.S. laying out details from the alleged threatening of donors to conservative nonprofit groups to the leaking of confidential I.R.S. documents. In that context he said the screening of Tea Party groups for special scrutiny was not the scandal itself but “just the latest example of a culture of cover-ups — and political intimidation — in this administration.” “It seems like the truth is hidden from the American people just long enough to make it through an election” Mr. Camp said. Taken aback the ranking Democrat on the committee Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan modified his prepared remarks to warn “If this hearing becomes essentially a bootstrap to continue the campaign of 2012 and to prepare for 2014 we will be making a very very serious mistake.” Republicans raised a long list of issues. Mr. Camp contended for instance that a White House official’s divulging of a private company’s tax status constituted “a clear intimidation tactic.” The 2010 incident involved an offhand comment by the White House economist Austan Goolsbee that Koch Industries had not paid corporate income taxes because it pays taxes through the personal income tax code. As it turned out that was not true but the assertion was made in a discussion of tax reform ideas not politics. The Republicans also criticized the publication of donors to the National Organization for Marriage a group opposed to same-sex marriage. That donors list surfaced mysteriously in March 2012 from a whistle-blower whose identity is still unknown. The whistle-blower apparently obtained it by simply requesting it from the I.R.S.  Linkage to the health care law came through Sarah Hall Ingram a longtime I.R.S. official who has headed the agency’s program to carry out the Affordable Care Act since December 2010. Before that she led the I.R.S.’s tax-exempt and government-entities division which contained the political targeting effort.  “This is an audit and it’s helpful” Representative Tim Griffin Republican of Arkansas said of the investigation of I.R.S. targeting by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration “but it’s the tip of the iceberg.” But the inspector general made clear that effort did not reach the attention of high-level I.R.S. officials until 2011 at the earliest. The inspector general gave Republicans some fodder Friday when he divulged that he informed the Treasury’s general counsel he was auditing the I.R.S.’s screening of politically active groups seeking tax exemptions on June 4 2012. He told Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin “shortly after” he said. That meant Obama administration officials were aware of the matter during the presidential campaign year. The disclosure last summer came as part of a routine briefing of the investigations that the inspector general would be conducting in the coming year and he did not tell the officials of his conclusions that the targeting had been improper he said.  Treasury officials stressed they did not know the results until March 2013 when the inspector presented a draft.  “Treasury strongly supports the independent oversight of its three inspectors general and it does not interfere in ongoing I.G. audits” the department said in a statement Friday evening. Still Inspector General J. Russell George’s testimony fueled efforts by Congressional Republicans to ensnare Mr. Obama in the scandals suddenly swirling over the White House. Representative Paul D. Ryan the Wisconsin Republican who joined the national ticket as the vice-presidential nominee last year said of the revelation “That raises a big question.”  Republicans hit hard on the divulging of confidential tax information hinting of intimidation not only by the I.R.S. but also by the White House.  In March 2012 the Human Rights Campaign and The Huffington Post made public confidential tax documents from the National Organization for Marriage. The Human Rights Campaign said it obtained the documents from a “whistle-blower” who mailed them to the gay rights group’s Washington headquarters. In a similar incident ProPublica an investigative journalism Web site asked the I.R.S.’s Cincinnati office for the applications of 67 nonprofits both liberal and conservative. When the I.R.S. responded it inadvertently included applications for nine conservative groups that had not yet been granted tax-exempt status a violation of confidentiality law. When ProPublica realized what it had — including the application from Crossroads GPS the conservative group founded by Karl Rove and other Republican strategists — it alerted the I.R.S. which warned the journalists that “publishing unauthorized returns or return information was a felony” punishable by up to five years in prison. ProPublica ProPublica redacted certain details and published the documents anyway. Representative Peter Roskam Republican of Illinois hit on a different explanation. “On the one hand you’re arguing today that the I.R.S. is not corrupt but the subtext of that is you’re saying ‘Look we’re just incompetent’ ” Mr. Roskam said. “It is a perilous pathway to go down.” One release that turned out to be advertent was last Friday’s disclosure of the agency’s conservative targeting. Steven Miller the ousted acting commissioner of the I.R.S. confessed that the agency’s apology was prompted by a question planted by the agency at an American Bar Association meeting. At that meeting Lois Lerner the head of the I.R.S.’s division overseeing tax-exempt organizations was asked about an inquiry into the targeting issue eliciting an apology that quickly leaked out of the closed-door session. The I.R.S. then scrambled to issue a formal release on the issue.  Mr. Miller divulged that the exchange was not an impromptu apology but a planned exchange between Ms. Lerner and Celia Roady a tax lawyer at the Washington office of the Morgan Lewis law firm. That revelation only underscored the ham-handed way the scandal has burst into view.  Under fire Mr. Miller called the agency’s targeting of conservative groups “obnoxious” but he told the House Ways and Means Committee it was not motivated by partisanship. And in testy exchanges he said he had not misled Congress even though he did not divulge the targeting efforts of a Cincinnati unit examining 70000 applications for tax exemption.  He called the group’s centralization of applications from groups with names that included the words “Tea Party” or “patriots” simply “foolish mistakes” that “were made by people trying to be more efficient in their workload selection.”
Washington Post,1,"[IRS targeted groups critical of government, documents from agency probe show]",At various points over the past two years Internal Revenue Service officials singled out for scrutiny not only groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names but also nonprofit groups that criticized the government and sought to educate Americans about the U.S. Constitution according to documents in an audit conducted by the agency’s inspector general. The documents obtained by The Washington Post from a congressional aide with knowledge of the findings show that the IRS field office in charge of evaluating applications for tax-exempt status decided to focus on groups making statements that “criticize how the country is being run” and those that were involved in educating Americans “on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.” The staffers in the Cincinnati field office were making high-level decisions on how to evaluate the groups because a decade ago the IRS assigned all applications to that unit. The IRS also eliminated an automatic after-the-fact review process Washington used to conduct such determinations.  Marcus Owens who oversaw tax-exempt groups at the IRS between 1990 and 1999 said that delegation “carries with it a risk” because the Cincinnati office “isn’t as plugged into what’s politically sensitive as Washington.” Owens now with the firm Caplin & Drysdale said that before the agency’s most recent reorganization it had a series of “tripwires in place” that could catch unfair targeting including the fact that the IRS identified its criteria for special scrutiny in a public manual.  “There’s no longer that safety valve and as a result the IRS has been rolling the dice ever since” said Owens who worked at the agency for nearly a quarter-century and now represents some organizations seeking tax-exempt status. The IRS came under withering attack from GOP lawmakers Sunday. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine a moderate Republican described the practice as “absolutely chilling” and called on President Obama to condemn the effort. “This is truly outrageous” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union” adding that even though White House spokesman Jay Carney has said the matter deserves an investigation “the president needs to make crystal clear that this is totally unacceptable in America.” In March 2012 then-IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman who was appointed by President George W. Bush told Congress that the agency was not targeting conservative groups. On Sunday the agency declined to answer questions about whether senior officials asked IRS exempt organizations division chief Lois G. Lerner and her staff in Cincinnati about this heightened scrutiny before testifying it did not take place. “There has to be accountability for the people who did it” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” adding: “And quite frankly up until a few days ago there’s got to be accountability for people who were telling lies about it being done.” The appendix of the inspector general’s report — which was requested by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and has yet to be publicly released — chronicles the extent to which the IRS’s exempt organizations division kept redefining what sort of “social welfare” groups it should single out for extra attention since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That decision allowed corporations and labor unions to raise and spend unlimited sums on elections as well as register for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code as long as their “primary purpose” was not targeting electoral candidates. The number of political groups applying for tax-exempt status more than doubled in the wake of the Citizens United ruling forcing agency officials to make a slew of determinations despite uncertainty about the category’s ambiguous definition.  Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny according to the congressional aide 72 had “tea party” in their title 13 had “patriot” and 11 had “9/12.” Lerner who apologized Friday for the targeting of such groups described it as a misguided effort to deal with a flood of applications for tax-exempt status. She did not release the names of the groups. On June 29 2011 according to the documents IRS staffers held a briefing with Lerner in which they described giving special attention to instances where “statements in the case file criticize how the country is being run.” She raised an objection and the agency adopted a more general set of standards. Lerner who is a Democrat is not a political appointee. But six months later the IRS applied a new political test to social welfare groups the document says. On Jan. 15 2012 the agency decided to look at “political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding Government educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights social economic reform movement” according to the appendix in the IG’s report. The agency did not appear to adopt a more neutral test for 501(c)(4) groups until May 17 2012 according to the timeline in the report. At that point the IRS again updated its criteria to focus on “organizations with indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention (raising questions as to exempt purpose and/or excess private benefit.)”  Campaign reform groups have been pressing the IRS for several years to conduct greater oversight of nonprofits formed in the wake of the Citizens United case given that many have become heavily involved in elections. “But this isn’t the type of enforcement we want” said Paul Ryan a senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center. “We want nonpartisan non-biased enforcement.”  Loyola Law School professor Ellen Aprill who specializes in tax law said any groups that have applied for tax-exempt status has “opened themselves up to scrutiny” by the IRS. “It’s part of their job to look for organizations that may be more likely to have too much campaign intervention” she said. “But it is important to try to make these criteria as politically neutral as possible.” Aprill said one of the problems is the agency’s top officials have not provided clear enough guidelines on what constitutes too much political activity for a social welfare group because it’s been “a hot potato” and that now with this new controversy “it’s going to make it even more difficult to do so.”  Toby Marie Walker president of the Waco Tea Party said the IRS subjected her group to a series of unreasonable requests after it applied for tax-exempt status in June 2010. The requests came in early 2012 Walker said after being initially informed by an official in the Cincinnati field office that he was “sitting on a stack of tea party applications and they were awaiting word from higher-ups as to how to process them.” The agency asked the group’s treasurer to supply information on its “close relationship” with current candidates and elected officials as well as future candidates along with detailed information about its contributors and members. It also asked for transcripts of any radio interviews its officials had done and hard copies of any news articles mentioning them. “That would take me years to do” Walker said noting that in some cases Chinese media outlets referred to her organization. “Am I responsible for every news article across the globe?” The group had even more difficulty providing transcripts and details of speakers at its events since they hosted informal gatherings such as “rant contests” where anyone could come and express their views.  While the IRS awarded the Waco Tea Party tax-exempt status about six weeks ago Walker said the group was now considering suing the agency since the process not only consumed time and effort but prompted the group to scale back its 2012 get-out-the-vote operation. “We were afraid to do it and get in trouble” she said. Sal Russo chief strategist for the Tea Party Express said that even though the agency’s actions intimidated tea party adherents he gives the IRS “credit for standing up and admitting” it targeted them. And while only two of the agency’s officials — the commissioner and the chief counsel — are political appointees Russo said the administration needs to conduct better oversight. “The culture is set at the top” Russo said. “Obviously you can’t control what every employee does. But you have to set a standard particularly with the IRS to be squeaky clean.”   Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums.
Washington Post,1,[IRS ‘BOLOs’ raise new questions about political targeting uproar],Internal Revenue Service documents showing that the agency might have scrutinized politically liberal groups before it inappropriately targeted conservative ones intensified debate on Capitol Hill last week leaving the agency and its watchdog scrambling to explain themselves.  The result may be an already embattled IRS that faces even more criticism and an inspector general risking a compromised reputation. J. Russell George’s May report about the IRS’s treatment of conservative groups led to public outrage agency apologies congressional hearings a Justice Department probe and several dismissals including the forced resignation of acting commissioner Steven Miller by the White House.  But Democrats are now questioning the Treasury inspector general’s audit in light of the new IRS documents which show that terms such as “progressive” “health care legislation” and “medical marijuana” appeared on a multipart “Be on the Lookout” list or BOLO that helped agents determine which groups deserved additional screening.  In a June 26 letter to the inspector general Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) said: “There is increasing evidence that the May 14 2013 audit was fundamentally flawed and that your handling of it has failed to meet the necessary test of objectivity and forthrightness.” George’s spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar fueled that notion when she told the Hill newspaper that the office of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) asked the inspector general to “narrowly focus on tea party organizations.” Issa’s office has denied it made such a request. Kraushaar has walked back her remarks telling The Washington Post “The statements attributed to me in The Hill are not accurate.” She did not say the article misquoted her. “Several members of Congress shared their concerns about tea party organizations” with the inspector general’s office Kraushaar said in an e-mail. “However the focus of our audit was on the IRS’s consistency in its identification and review of applications for tax-exempt status involving potential political advocacy issues.” George appointed to his position in 2006 by President George W. Bush said in a letter to Levin that his office “reviewed all cases that the IRS identified as potential political cases and did not limit our audit to allegations related to the Tea Party.”  The inspector general testified before Congress last month that his office was unable to determine whether any cases in the audit involved progressive groups. He said the names “in many instances were neutral in that you couldn’t necessarily attribute it to one particular affiliation or another.” Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) whose questioning prompted that response said in a recent letter to George that his testimony was “at best incomplete if not misleading.” He also suggested that George should appear again before the House Oversight Committee to “explain himself.” There is little doubt that the IRS erred in its review of tax-exemption applications.  Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel whom President Obama appointed to lead the agency after Miller’s resignation said in a conference call with reporters last week that the screening methods were inappropriate.  But Werfel added his agency’s 30-day internal review had “not found evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS or involvement in these matters by anyone outside the IRS.” The BOLO could still be problematic for the IRS. The list’s “emerging issues” category included only conservative-associated terms at the outset raising questions about why the IRS prioritized conservative groups but not those from the political left.  The term “progressive” appeared in a separate part of the BOLO and questions remain about when and how that term was used as well as whether those separate BOLO categories were even relevant to the audit. The IRS and George’s office have said they’re still looking into those matters.  The BOLO also directed agents to flag tea party cases for further review while allowing processors to approve other types of groups “on merit if applicable.” George’s audit focused primarily on the “emerging issues” category as part of an effort to help identify groups involved in possible campaign intervention — something that can potentially disqualify an organization from tax-exempt status.  George has said the IRS did not use progressive criteria to identify groups involved in campaign intervention.  “We are reviewing whether these criteria led to expanded scrutiny for other reasons and why these criteria were implemented” his office said in a statement last week.  Republicans have downplayed the recent revelations about “progressive” search criteria. “Our Democratic colleagues should stop trying to derail the investigation by defending IRS officials with distorted claims equating the systematic scrutiny of Tea Party groups with the more routine screening progressive groups received” Issa said. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said the IRS controversy goes beyond the issue of search terms to the inappropriate questions agents asked of conservative groups and alleged leaks of private taxpayer information.  “At this point the evidence shows us that conservative groups were not only flagged but targeted and abused by the IRS” said Camp spokeswoman Sarah Swinehart. “As we gather the facts we will follow them wherever they lead us.”
Huffington Post,0,"[Karl Rove Talks IRS Scandal, Compares His Group To NAACP]","WASHINGTON -- Karl Rove on Sunday defended his group Crossroads GPS a 501(c)4 non-profit organization against charges that it improperly benefited from a tax exemption intended for social welfare organizations. Rove said liberal organizations had first exploited the loophole which has garnered attention in the wake of news the IRS scrutinized applications for tax-exempt status from small tea party groups. ""501(c)4s have been around for a long time and the Democrats and the left have used these for years to do some politics and a lot of social welfare"" Rove said on ""Fox News Sunday"" listing the NAACP the Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood as groups that serve a social welfare function and still engage in political activity. ""You have to spend a majority of your money on social welfare and a minority of your resources on political activity."" Rove a career political strategist raised hundreds of millions of dollars during the 2012 election and spent them on political advertisements designed to influence the presidential and congressional races. Rove's Crossroads GPS is one of hundreds of essentially political organizations that receive tax-exempt status designed for ""social welfare"" groups. While many have called for reforms to the law allowing such groups to receive tax breaks Rove insisted that the exemption is justified and that organizations that support the Democratic Party have been working the statute longer. ""What happened is the Democrats had this for decades for literally decades and no criticism at all. Then Republicans began in 2010 to say wait a minute if it's good enough for them we'll duplicate that structure as well. Then suddenly we get what we get which is a huge bunch of activity aimed at conservative groups."" The Bush administration probed the NAACP's tax-exempt status between 2004 and 2006 and ultimately allowed the group to maintain its classification. Rove's organizations do not provide the counseling legal assistance and other support functions that the NAACP provides on civil rights. Federal agencies frequently target smaller players who may be abusing the system to avoid lengthy legal battles with more prominent companies or organizations. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) on Sunday criticized the IRS for targeting small Tea Party groups while allowing bigger fish like Rove's Crossroads GPS to pass through with little scrutiny.  ""It's outrageous that the IRS went after these small tea party groups when Karl Rove is out there saying that he wants to use these groups to change the outcome of the election"" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said on ABC's ""This Week."""
LA Times,0,[ Pastor pulls out of Obama inauguration benediction ],WASHINGTON — An evangelical minister who was asked to give the benediction at President Obama’s inauguration ceremony pulled out of the event Thursday after a controversy about comments he made against homosexuality in the 1990s. On Tuesday the presidential inaugural committee announced that it had invited the Rev. Louie Giglio head pastor of Passion City Church in Atlanta to participate in the Jan. 21 ceremony. Soon afterward the liberal website ThinkProgress posted excerpts and an audio file of a sermon Giglio gave in the mid-1990s in which he criticizes homosexuality as profoundly antithetical to Christianity. “You come to only one conclusion: Homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation” Giglio said in the sermon. “It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us is sin. That’s God’s voice.” After having courted the gay and lesbian community during his first term with efforts like the elimination of the military’s “don’t ask don’t tell” policy the president’s inclusion of Giglio 54 in the inauguration quickly proved awkward. The Obama administration is already fending off criticism from some on the left over negative remarks made by secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel in 1998 about a gay diplomat. No one answered the phone Thursday at Passion City Church whose ministry focuses on young people. But on the church’s website Giglio wrote that after discussions between his team and the administration he had decided to withdraw from the inauguration so as not to become a distraction.Advertisement “The issue of homosexuality (which a particular message of mine some 20 years ago addressed) is one of the most difficult our nation will navigate” Giglio wrote. “However individuals’ rights of freedom and the collective right to hold differing views on any subject is a critical balance we as a people must recover and preserve.” Typically clergy members asked to participate in presidential events undergo rigorous vetting but mistakes occasionally occur said John Green director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. The Obama inauguration committee appeared to acknowledge the slip. “We were not aware of Pastor Giglio’s past comments at the time of his selection and they don’t reflect our desire to celebrate the strength and diversity of our country at this inaugural” said spokeswoman Addie Whisenant. “Pastor Giglio was asked to deliver the benediction in large part for his leadership in combating human trafficking around the world.” Gay rights activists praised Giglio’s departure. Evangelical groups condemned it. A rising star in the evangelical community Giglio did not disavow the sermon which represents the way many conservative Christians view homosexuality. For the last two decades American Christianity has been divided sometimes acrimoniously over growing societal acceptance of gays and lesbians and what certain Old Testament verses say about same-sex interactions. The country’s increased religious diversity Green said can make choosing clergy for an event like the inauguration exceedingly delicate. “The symbolism is very important when clergy are involved in a presidential ceremony” Green said. “Different kinds of clergy are invited to show that the president has support from and supports the religious diversity of America. You have to assemble a good program now that might not offend somebody. But because we have faith-based disagreements in America that’s not easy to do.” neela.banerjee@latimes.com
Breitbart,3,[Politico Coordinates with Democrats; Attacks Victims of IRS],When the trifecta of scandals first broke over the White House a few weeks ago the media (who were literally blocking the truth from getting out about the IRS and Benghazi) were so caught off guard that for a couple of weeks they accidentally acted like real media and just reported the facts. Over Memorial Day weekend that all changed.  It is fairly obvious that the media used the three-day weekend to gather themselves talk to the White House and coordinate talking points with one another. The result of this coordination has been apparent in the words “overreach” “McCarthyism” “disarray” and “no GOP agenda” — all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete not coordinate with one another.  The idea is for the media to revert to form. Rather than seek the truth the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth. Obama’s approval rating is going down his left-wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy and the bleeding must be stopped.  Another piece of coordination between media and Democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places: Politico. No one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support Obama than Obama’s bullying thugs at Politico.  During Tuesday’s testimony Congressional Democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories. The witnesses were Tea Party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an IRS that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs.  Democrats however did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the IRS scrutiny due to their political activity.   Well that is not the point and everyone knows it. Had the IRS put the same number of left-leaning groups through the same hyper-scrutiny as they did right-leaning groups none of this would be happening. There would be no scandal. But the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the IRS singled out Obama’s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run-up to Obama’s re-election campaign to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups.   The thinking goes that if Democrats can make the Tea Party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of Obama and further damage his opponents.  Well right on cue Politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest (but expected) piece of reporting that falls right in line with what Congressional Democrats did yesterday. It is as pure a piece of coordination and left-wing propaganda as you will ever read.  And this is the only kind of investigative reporting Politico ever does. Imagine if Politico poured these same resources into investigating the IRS’s connections to the White House or the shaping of the IRS talking points by the State Department.  But today’s Politico piece is all about changing the subject. All it looks at is the political activity of yesterday’s Tea Party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the IRS.  The Politico piece however intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal. The point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government.  The Politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax-exempt left-leaning groups (like Obama’s Organizing for America) — groups approved by the IRS that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and  threats of perjury-those who had their information leaked to the media.  Working directly with the Democrats Politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the IRS.  The actual crime is no longer the story according to Politico. No the story is that the victims had it coming.    Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC         MediaPoliticoWhite House .

Breitbart,1,[10 Questions Obama Must Answer on IRS Scandal],Obama will face reporters on Thursday to answer questions about the IRS scandal that placed nearly 500 conservative organizations in the IRS’s crosshairs during the 2010 and 2012 elections.  Beyond the classic question “What did the Administration know and when did it know it?” a myriad of questions remain unanswered.  Here are just a few: Whether reporters will ask and Obama will answer the critical questions that must be resolved remains to be seen.   PoliticsSheldon WhitehouseTom UdallWhite House .

Fox News,0,"[FBI under pressure to explain drone use, as Obama names new director]","Questions surround use in U.S. Sen. Rand Paul R-Ky. was the latest to scrutinize the bureau sending a letter on Thursday to outgoing Director Robert Mueller asking a string of questions about his agency's drone use. ""I am disturbed by the revelation that the FBI has unilaterally decided to begin using drone surveillance technology without a governance policy and thus without the requisite assurances that the constitutional rights of Americans are being protected"" Paul wrote. Mueller acknowledged Wednesday during a Senate hearing that the bureau has a limited number of drones that it uses for surveillance on U.S. soil. He stressed they are used in a ""very very minimal way and very seldom."" Newly released documents show that the FBI has sought and received permission from the FAA at least four times to fly surveillance drones inside the U.S. since 2010. The use of non-lethal drones for surveillance purposes is rapidly getting off the ground among local law enforcement agencies and other groups. Mueller in acknowledging that the FBI too has obtained surveillance drones said the bureau is in the ""initial stages"" of drafting rules and regulations for their use. Sen. Mark Udall D-Colo. took umbrage at that fact saying that while drones have the potential to help law enforcement agencies constitutional rights must come first. ""I am concerned the FBI is deploying drone technology while only being in the 'initial stages' of developing guidelines to protect Americans' privacy rights. I look forward to learning more about this program and will do everything in my power to hold the FBI accountable and ensure its actions respect the U.S. Constitution"" he said in a statement. The FBI clarified on Friday that its drone use is governed by existing bureau regulations and FAA rules. It confirmed that the specific drone model is the PUMA AE manufactured by California firm AeroVironment. The model is hand-launched battery-powered and can send live color and thermal video to its operator according to the company. It is designed to respond to disasters and other incidents. The issue is likely to follow Obama's new nominee to lead the FBI Jim Comey. Obama nominated the former federal prosecutor on Friday. Sen. Charles Grassley R-Iowa who originally asked Mueller about the drone program also wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday seeking ""clarification"" regarding a prior response from the department that did not disclose the FBI's drones. He too asked Holder to explain when the FBI began using them what checks are in place for the program and whether any are capable of being armed. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson clarified earlier this week that the aircraft are only used in ""very limited circumstances to support operations where there was a specific operational need."" He cited an example of a hostage situation in Alabama earlier this year where a drone helped law enforcement. He said they are only used to conduct surveillance ""on stationary subjects."" And the bureau must obtain FAA approval first."
