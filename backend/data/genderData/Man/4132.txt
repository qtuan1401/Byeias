What? Congress has until midnight Friday to come up with a plan to fund the government through early December, or once again, it will be lights out for many operations. The problem this time: Passing a plan all seemed quite simple, since Democrats and Republicans gave up several policy items they wanted attached to the overall spending bill. But the measure still omits $220 million that Democrats wanted to help Flint, Mich. and other cities manage emergencies, and they are threatening to block the bill when it comes to the Senate floor on Tuesday. Who to watch: Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader from Nevada, who may broker a final deal. Keep an eye on Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and a longstanding and fierce advocate for Flint who rarely gives up a legislative fight easily.
