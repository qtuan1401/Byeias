’   So what’s a condo worth in the   Millennium Tower at 301   Mission St. the most luxurious condo tower in San Francisco,   which has sunk 16 inches since its completion in 2008 and began   leaning in 2009? ’ ’   The tilt has reached 2 inches. Majestic   has   ensued. Lawyers have been unleashed. Investigations, studies, and     have commenced. No one is certain how to repair   it, or if it is repairable at all. ’ ’   A few things are certain: Large amounts of moolah will   change hands, lawyers will get rich, and if taxpayers don’t watch   out, the moolah may well change from their hands to other   people’s hands  —   because the city of San Francisco has been   dragged up to its eyeballs into this. ’ ’   Lenders too are on the hook. California is one of the dozen or so   “ ” states. Standard purchase mortgages are    : they’re secured only by the property. When push   comes to shove, borrowers might be tempted to let the bank worry   about their properties in the . ’ ’   Below is an image of the Millennium Tower via Google Earth.   Note the construction site to the right and in front of it.   That’s the future Transbay Terminal, the construction of which is   being amply and conveniently blamed for the sinking and leaning,   though the sinking and leaning seems to have started before   ground was even broken: ’ ’  ’ ’    ’ ’’ ’   Before  that the tower was   sinking and leaning, condos had been valued from $563, 084 to   $12. 6 million, with 141 units valued at over one million,   according to the SF Examiner; but now the dynamics   have changed: “Some stated figures as low as $0, $1 or $2. Others   knocked off a million dollars or reduced the value by half. ” ’ ’   Some owners didn’t knock the value of their units into     territory, but they still knocked it down: ’ ’     Mary Velez, a taxpayer with Raimondo Pettit Group, represents a     condo owned by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, who had     sold one of the two condos he owned several years ago. The one     Montana still owns is valued at $2. 8 million, but the appeal     filed on his behalf argues the condo is now valued at $500, 000.   ’ ’     “We didn’t have any guidance on what to put. We just put that     as a number,” Velez said. “$0 might be a good number if the     property can’t be sold at any price. ” She noted that values     could climb in subsequent years if the building is     “repairable. ”   ’ ’     “I’m sure nobody really knows the value,” Velez said.   ’ ’   Uncertainty prevails. “I’m not sure how we are going to handle   it,” Alistair Gibson, executive secretary of the Assessment   Appeals Board, told theExaminer. The board has up to two   years to hold a hearing on the appeals, by which time the tower   will likely be tilting a little further. “We don’t know what’s   going to happen with that building. There are going to be other   issues involved. ” ’ ’   Clearly, there is a long line of people jostling for position to   buy a condo at the Millennium Tower for $0, or $1, or even   twice as much. I know a few potential buyers myself at these   prices. I’d even outbid them. Buying and selling a condo isn’t   like  but at this price, it   doesn’t matter if the tower topples in a few years, just as long   as you’re not in it when it does. ’ ’   That’s not an issue anyway. Everyone, including Mayor Ed   Lee, has assured everyone that the building is safe at the   moment, even during an earthquake. ’ ’   At a few bucks, these condos are a buy even if the association   fees that are already high will further balloon, given the costs   of keeping elevators running, fixing buckling sidewalks and   broken pipes, filling cracks in the glorious swimming pool so   that the water won’t drain out overnight, and so on. But a condo   for $1, even one without a spectacular view, would be a deal. ’ ’   It’s easy to say with hindsight, but you’d think that a tower in   the formerly muddy part of San Francisco right by the former   shoreline would be built on bedrock, however deep they’d have to   go down to find it. But no. ’ ’   And there’s no obligation to disclose to potential buyers that   the concrete building is heavy and more prone to sinking than a     building, and that it was nevertheless built on a   concrete slab that in turn rests on concrete piles that go down   about 80 feet into   and sand, and that the bedrock starts   at about 200 feet. ’ ’   Taking the piles all the way down to bedrock would have been too   expensive, and the developer might have had trouble selling the   condos at a higher price. So this is not the only building with   this design in that part of San Francisco. ’ ’   If the price is right, there will be a market for these condos.   Filing an appeal to knock the assessed valued down to $0, $1, or   even $2 appears to be a delicious if utterly dark form of      humor by immensely aggrieved condo owners  —     associated with perhaps some legal benefits in future court   battles and settlements. ’ ’   There are already enough problems in San Francisco’s housing   market, as the supply of apartments is ballooning.
