Friday at the United Nations, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, the U. N. Messenger of Peace, urged world leaders to leave fossil fuels “in the ground where they belong. ”  “Our planet cannot be saved, unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground, where they belong,” said in his address to the United Nations. “An upheaval, a massive change is required right now, one that leads to a new collective consciousness, a new collective evolution of the human race, inspired and enabled by a sense of urgency from all of you,” DiCaprio continued. “You are the last best hope of earth,” he added. “We ask you to protect it or we and all living things we cherish are history. ” (  Grabien) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
