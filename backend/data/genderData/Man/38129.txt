 (CNN) This time last week, Carlo Ancelotti was able to boast a perfect start to his time in Germany as Bayern Munich coach. With a DFL Supercup title in the bag, five league victories on the spin and a hammering dished out to FC Rostov in the Champions League, there seemed little that could ruffle the Italian coach. But defeat to Atletico Madrid in Europe midweek was followed by a disappointing   draw at home to Bundesliga rivals FC Cologne Saturday.

Bayern came closest to taking the win with Juan Bernat striking the woodwork with a powerful shot in the closing stages. ”We’re disappointed, but we have no reason to be concerned,” Ancelotti later told reporters in comments carried by the official Bayern Munich website. ”Let’s not forget we’ve made a really good start to the season.

We’ll push on after the international break,” he added.
