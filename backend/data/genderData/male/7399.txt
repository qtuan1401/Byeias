The Security Council on Thursday formally recommended António Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal, to be the next Secretary General of the United Nations. The envoys representing the 15 members of the Council, including the five   permanent members, decided by acclamation in a   session to send Mr. Guterres’s name to the General Assembly for final approval. Speaking in Lisbon after the Council’s vote, Mr. Guterres said he accepted the endorsement with “gratitude and humility. ” The selection process was an “exemplary process of transparency and openness,” he said, and the willingness of the deeply divided Security Council’s to reach consensus over his nomination should serve as “a symbolic moment. ” He pledged to show “the humility that is needed to serve especially those that are most vulnerable,” victims of conflict, terrorism, human rights violations and poverty. Mr. Guterres, 67, who ran the United Nations refugee agency for 10 years, was the   among 13 candidates, including a record seven women. Two candidates had dropped out. Many veteran diplomats and   activists had hoped that the United Nations would be led by a woman for the first time in its   history. Mindful of the issue of gender equity, Mr. Guterres has promised parity in making appointments to senior posts, but has not been more specific about how he would advance the rights of women through the work of the organization. The   General Assembly is expected to approve Mr. Guterres’s appointment next week. If elected, he will succeed the current secretary general, Ban   whose second   term expires at the end of this year.
