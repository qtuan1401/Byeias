NFL Hall of Fame quarterback and Fox Sports analyst Terry Bradshaw appeared Tuesday on “Fox  Friends” to discuss the national anthem protests led by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  While Bradshaw admitted that he does not mind players expressing themselves, he does have a problem with people disrespecting the American flag. “I’ve never had a problem with people expressing themselves  —   it’s one thing great about our country and the First Amendment rights, everybody has them. I do have a problem with the flag. I am a man that loves the flag. I love the national anthem. I find it extremely disrespectful, but if in fact that’s what they want to do, then they do it. There are repercussions. I think that you are going to pay for it some way or another,” Bradshaw said. “I don’t mind what Colin is doing that’s bringing attention to it,” he continued. “I don’t have a problem with that at all. Absolutely no problem with it. I do have a problem when people in this country don’t respect our flag and national anthem, and all you got to do is look around. This country is getting worse and worse and more and more immoral and we’re rotting from within. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
