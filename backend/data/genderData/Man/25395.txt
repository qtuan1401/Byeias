Chris Pratt erected a giant cross on Easter Sunday and posted a    instructional guide to his process on Instagram.  The    actor, who’s currently filming Guardians of the Galaxy 2, spent the holiday getting his hands dirty while setting up the cross, which appears to be at least roughly 20 feet tall.

A photo posted by chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) on Mar 27, 2016 at 5:57pm PDT,  Pratt is something of an anomaly in Hollywood: A   “eats what he kills,” happily married father who keeps perpetually offended media types at bay by offering sarcastic apologies before press tours. The Jurassic World star has also spoken publicly about his Christian faith, telling Esquire in 2014 that he became religious as a teenager in Hawaii before he was discovered and moved to Hollywood to star in movies. Pratt told ABC News that the premature birth of his son Jack (with his wife, actress Anna Faris) in 2012 reaffirmed his faith. “It restored my faith in God, not that it needed to be restored, but it really redefined it,” Pratt said then. “The baby was so beautiful to us, and I look back at the photos of him and it must have been jarring for other people to come in and see him, but to us he was so beautiful and perfect. ” Pratt stars next in Antoine Fuqua’s remake of The Magnificent Seven, and in the   thriller Passengers with Jennifer Lawrence later this year.
