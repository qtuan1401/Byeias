’  ’ ’   The world has crossed a major   milestone, and it   may never turn back. ’ ”   The Manua Loa Observatory in Hawaii has maintained a continuous   record of atmospheric   levels since 1958. Here’s   the complete record of readings from the observatory over that   time period: ” ’  ’ ”   As you can see, atmospheric CO2 cycles every year, but there’s a   significant upward trend in the measurements. ” ”   Right now we’re at the low point in that cycle, just at the end   of September. And, according to a post from the  (which we first saw   covered ) atmospheric CO2 is holding at 401 parts   per million. That’s the first time in recorded history that the   annual carbon cycle has bottomed out at over 400 ppm. And it   means the 2016 carbon trough is about 25% higher than the 1958   peak  under 320 ppm. ” ”   As Scripps points out, there have been a few years when the   readings in October have been a bit lower than September. But   they’ve never seen one full ppm drop, so it’s unlikely we’ll see   a reading under 400 ppm this year. ” ”   And given the steady upward trend in atmospheric CO2, it also   means we’ll likely never see a reading under 400 ppm in the   foreseeable climate future. ” ’   The last time atmospheric carbon held above 400 ppm was . The world was three to six degrees warmer, and sea   levels were between 75 and 120 feet higher, according to . ’ ’   Which is to say: This is perhaps a milestone to note. ’
