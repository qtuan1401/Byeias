The boy’s aunt sustained leg injuries but was reported to be in stable condition. Police arrested    Donna Marie Higgins on charges of felony    and felony drunk driving. Prosecutors could add a charge of vehicular manslaughter in the wake of the child’s death. In a Facebook post, Kowal, a   MMA fighter and commentator, said his family had decided to donate the boy’s organs “so that his little heart can make another child live and another set of parents not have to go through what we have to. ” In a   post on Tuesday morning, the fighter requested that social media followers not give out his cell phone number to parents waiting for organ donations for their children. “I’ve received 100s of messages from hopeful parents and I can’t even continue to write ‘I’m so sorry, his organs have already been donated.’ Let alone, tell a crying mother over the phone,” Kowal wrote. “I wish I could do more but I can’t. My baby’s organs have been donated and I beg of you, please, please do not give out my number. Let us mourn in peace. ” The family has set up a fundraising page to cover funeral and medical costs.
