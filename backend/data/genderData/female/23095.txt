A. J. Daulerio, former    of Gawker, claimed that he would only draw the line and withhold posting a sex tape if it featured someone that was four   or younger. [Daulerio made the statement in a Florida courtroom during a videotaped depostion in the Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker trial. Hogan is seeking $100 million compensation after the blogging network released a sex tape featuring the former wrestling champion having sex with his friend’s wife.  “Can you imagine a situation where a celebrity sex tape would not be newsworthy?” Hogan’s lawyer asked Daulerio. “If they were a child,” replied the    former Gawker editor. “Under what age?” enquired Hogan’s lawyer. “Four,” replied Daulerio bluntly. “No    sex tapes, OK,” confirmed Hogan’s lawyer. Daulerio also made other bizarre remarks throughout the deposition. Upon being asked whether “It wouldn’t upset you in any way to have your sexual encounters appear on the Internet?” Daulerio replied that he “somewhat expect[s] that to happen at some point”. He also mentioned that he found the sex tape “very amusing,” and when asked if he’d still have published it if he’d known Hogan would find it emotionally distressing, he replied with a blunt and simple, “Sure, yes. ” “You didn’t care, really, did you?” asked Hogan’s lawyer. “No,” replied Daulerio. Jurors in attendance were reportedly “distressed” by Daulerio’s manner and tone. Charlie Nash is a frequent contributor to Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.
