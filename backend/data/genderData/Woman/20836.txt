A Floridian man has been arrested after he allegedly used the dating app Plenty of Fish to lure teenagers to his motel room so he could then sell them for sex.[    Edward Antonio Alvarez, a known gang member, is accused of luring two victims, aged fifteen and sixteen, before taking sexual pictures of the two minors and posting them to classified site Backpage. com.  “I ain’t going to force nobody,” Alvarez reportedly told an undercover officer before being arrested. “I tried to help them better themselves. ” Alvarez also has a history of violent crime and vehicular homicide, with the latter stemming from a hit and run where he fatally injured a cyclist in March. Before being arrested, Alvarez allegedly confessed to the undercover officer that he was going to go back on the dating app to “get some more” girls, who he was scouting for prostitution work. Officers managed to save the two girls from the motel after three days of investigation, and Alvarez is currently being held in the Orange County Jail without bond.
