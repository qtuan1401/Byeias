Washington (CNN) There’s plenty of bad blood between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, but for two nights this week, one woman will bring them together: Taylor Swift.  A whopping 26 congressional lawmakers and political action committees plan to host fundraisers in private suites at Swift’s concert at Nationals Park on July 13 and 14. A handful of lawmakers booked spots months ago, but since then, the number of politicos advertising events at the concert has exploded, according to information listed by technology firm Coalescent. A source who receives the fundraising reports provided a list to CNN.  The bipartisan gathering might not amount to a love story between the parties, but 18 Republican and eight Democratic lawmakers and PACs plan to charge supporters between $750 to $2, 500 per ticket for a chance to hobnob with elected officials during the show. Tickets are available to the public for around $60. The upcoming   aren’t the first time lawmakers have hosted events tied to Swift. A smaller group of politicians also used Swift’s D. C. visits in 2010 and 2011 as well, according to the Sunlight Foundation, which tracks political fundraising.  For her part, Swift doesn’t advertise her political views.  ”I try to keep myself as educated and informed as possible,” she told TIME in 2012. ”But I don’t talk about politics because it might influence other people.”  Here is a list of fundraisers at the concert. (Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady, who’s office has reserved a suite, is not listed. )Lawmakers can’t seem to get enough of the pop star. The social media accounts for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican presidential candidate, is full of Swift references.  Last week, interns working in Florida Republican Rep. Ileana  ’s office made an entire music video based on ”Shake It Off.”
