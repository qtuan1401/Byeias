Twitter has now introduced its   timeline algorithm automatically across the world, meaning you will see the “best tweets” at the beginning of your page instead of in chronological order. [The new timeline was announced last month, causing the #RIPTwitter hashtag to trend worldwide in a revolt by users. Even celebrities like Rob Lowe, William Shatner, and Ben Ferguson criticised the move and joined in with the hashtag.  The feature was introduced after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey previously promised that no such move would take place and that there was no reason to panic. Hello Twitter! Regarding #RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we’re always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week.  —   Jack (@jack) February 6, 2016,  But if there’s anything we’ve learned from Twitter, it’s that you absolutely cannot trust them. They frequently put political advantage   of user experience, and now that your timeline has automatically changed, they can put whatever they think’s best in front of you. Here’s how to change it: Step 1: Go to the small portrait of your profile picture located in the   hand of the page. It should be to the   side of a button labelled “Tweet. ” Step 2: Select “Settings” in the   menu that appears when you click on the portrait.  Step 3: Untick the box which says “Show me the best Tweets first” and click “Save Changes” at the bottom of the page. This will then ask you to confirm by entering your password.  Your Twitter timeline should then be back to how it was before, and how it should always be. Twitter commented on the situation, claiming, “As we said in our announcement, we’re rolling out our timeline improvements to everyone over time. People can still choose to opt out of it in their settings. ” Charlie Nash is a frequent contributor to Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.
