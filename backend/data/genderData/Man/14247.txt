The Obama White House is getting the Hollywood treatment as a workplace comedy. [According to the Hollywood Reporter (THR) Universal Pictures and Anonymous Content are developing a “  workplace comedy” based on the book proposal From the Corner of the Oval by Beck   a former White House stenographer.  Stein’s book has been picked up by Random House Publishing Group division Spiegel  Grau. “The book doesn’t promise a revealing look inside the inner workings of the Obama administration, but focuses more on the White House as a workplace and on the relationships between the staffers,” THR reports. “From the Corner of the Oval follows a young woman living in Washington D. C. who is at an   career low when, through a twist of fate, she goes from serving cocktails to lobbyists to being hired as a stenographer in the Obama White House,” THR says of the book’s synopsis. “The ultimate fish out of water, she stumbles into an elite world and finds herself navigating a series of misadventures in life and love. ” The film will be produced by Anonymous Content’s Michael Sugar, whose previous work includes the   drama Spotlight. From the Corner of the Oval is due out in 2018. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson.
