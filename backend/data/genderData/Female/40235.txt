Washington (CNN) Mary Cheney wants to know why it isn’t ”socially acceptable” for a white person to ”put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of  ” if drags queens are allowed to imitate female stereotypes? If a man can dress up as a woman to entertain an audience, then why can’t a white person get on stage in blackface, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney wondered aloud Thursday in a private Facebook post obtained by CNN. ”Why is it socially acceptable    as a form of entertainment    for men to put on dresses, make up and high heels and act out every offensive stereotype of women (bitchy, catty, dumb, slutty, etc.)    but it is not socially acceptable    as a form of entertainment    for a white person to put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of African Americans?” Cheney wrote in a post on Thursday her private Facebook page. Some of Cheney’s posts appear to only be visible to those who are in her Facebook network.   ”Shouldn’t both be ok or neither?” Cheney wondered. Cheney, who is openly gay and married, emphasized that she was not drawing any comparisons between white people painting their faces black and transgender individuals, only men who entertain in drag. Cheney said the question was sparked after seeing an ad on TV for the upcoming season of Logo’s RuPaul’s Drag Race.  Asked via Facebook message whether she’d like to clarify her comments, Cheney gave a brief response: ”Seriously?” It’s not the first time Cheney has taken her views to Facebook. Cheney took to Facebook in Nov. 2013 after her sister Liz, who was campaigning for Senate in the Wyoming GOP primary, reaffirmed her opposition to   marriage.  ”Liz    this isn’t just an issue on which we disagree    you’re just wrong    and on the wrong side of history,” Cheney wrote then on Facebook.
