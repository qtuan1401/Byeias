On February 26, Governor Terry McAuliffe (D) turned his back to   Everytown for Gun Safety and signed legislation restoring Virginia concealed carry reciprocity with 25 states. [Breitbart News previously reported the end of reciprocity with the 25 states was unilaterally announced by Attorney General Mark Herring (D) on December 22. Herring made clear the issue at hand was the impression that those states were not pursuing gun control as aggressively as people affiliated with the McAuliffe administration would like them to.  However, when news broke that a number of the affected states  —   Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wyoming  —   would not be honoring Virginia concealed carry licenses without Virginia honoring theirs as well, the pubic became enraged and the outcry against Herring’s actions was palpable. So just over a month after Herring’s announcement, McAuliffe made clear he would be reversing the AG’s decision and restoring the reciprocity agreements with all 25 states.   Everytown came unglued. They launched a social media campaign against McAuliffe and took out a   ad against him, highlighting what they claim are numerous false statements he made about the trustworthiness of concealed permit holders and other   issues. But he   reports that the reversal of Herring’s December announcement is now complete, McAuliffe signed legislation restoring reciprocity on Friday.
