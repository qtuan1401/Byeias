Facebook has refused to remove a graphic image depicting a policeman having his throat slit, reports the Daily Mail. [(Warning  —   Graphic content posted below)  The picture, posted on “Black Panther Party of Mississippi,” a Facebook page frequented by the Dallas shooter, Micah Xavier Johnson, was reported to the social network by a concerned user. But Facebook refused to take the image down. In a response to the user, Facebook said the picture did not violate their policies. “We reviewed the post you reported for promoting graphic violence and found it doesn’t violate our Community Standards” said the social network in their reply. Facebook does not have a blanket ban on violent images, as they are sometimes used in news reporting. However, its community standards do prohibit images that are shared for “sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. ” This unquestionably captures the image that was posted to the Black Panther page, but the social network has yet to take action. At the time of writing, the image remains hosted on the platform.  According to the Daily Mail, Dallas shooter and black supremacist Micah Xavier Johnson posted to the same Facebook page several times before his deadly attacks in Texas.
