Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta mocked her tendency to laugh loudly at inappropriate times in another embarrassing snit between top Democrats, leaked emails reveal. [Podesta and senior advisor to advocacy group Engage Cuba Luke Albee discussed the contentious House Committee hearing held about her conduct during the deadly terrorist attack on a U. S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya.  “Thought she was really good. Really good. She sometimes laughs a little too hard at jokes that aren’t that funny. Other than that  …    A,” Albee wrote on Sept. 20, 2015. “Laughing too hard is her authentic weirdness,” Podesta replied that day. Albee later smeared South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who led the questioning, as a Klu Klux Klan member: “Was sensitive enough not to wear his sheet to the hearing,” he wrote back to Podesta on Oct. 22, 2015. “I think he protested too much. Made this all about Committee’s legitimacy and not what happened,” Podesta said. The leaked email is part of a series of releases from Wikileaks regarding the Clinton campaign. Remarking on Hillary Clinton’s quirk of laughing loudly at odd moments has been repeatedly derided as “sexist” by the mainstream media.
