On Wednesday, New York Knicks star forward Carmelo Anthony reacted to the alleged robbery that resulted in his teammate, Cleanthony Early, being shot in the knee in Queens earlier that day.  A reporter asked Anthony if Early’s shooting underscores “the need for gun control. ” “I mean we’ve got to do something,” Anthony warned. “I mean you feel it. I felt it in Baltimore, in that situation, the Freddie Gray situation, and I’m feeling it now with a teammate of mine that’s much closer. It’s just something that we have to do. We’ve got to figure it out. I don’t know how we figure it out. I don’t have the answers. I’m pretty sure a lot of people are working on trying to figure that out. But we have to do something. We have to figure that part out. ” In December, Anthony, appearing with the NBA’s Stephen Curry and Chris Paul, said,  “The gun should never be an option” in a video released by the NBA pushing for an end to “gun violence. ” The Knicks forward also walked with protestors after the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore.
