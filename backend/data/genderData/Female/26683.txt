Per a PIX 11 report, Utah police are looking for answers after a father left his    daughter in the middle of the night and left her in the cold.  A security guard found the little girl in at a doorway on the campus of the   Applied Technology College in Ogden, UT around 7:30 AM. Surveillance footage shows the father leaving the girl at that same spot hours before. According to the girl’s mother, Gena, the child was staying with her father at his parent’s house for the weekend two weekends ago. She adds that her daughter is traumatized from the experience. “She said she got scared, She was yelling, ‘Daddy!’ but no one was there,” the Gena said. “She said she just kind of had her blanket and waited until daylight. ” The mother said the girl was told “to shut up, and lay down and go to sleep. ” Police have yet to speak with the father, who they say could be charged with felony child abandonment or abuse.
