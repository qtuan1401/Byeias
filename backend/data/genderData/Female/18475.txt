American Urban Radio Networks White House Correspondent and Washington Bureau Chief April Ryan stated that the blocking of Supreme Court nominee Judge Merrick Garland is “blacklash” and “some on the Hill” don’t like that the first black president is in the White House on Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Hardball. ”  Ryan was asked by host Chris Matthews, “I think  —   do you think people look at this as another one of those boots in the face to the president, on the racial front? First of all, he’s a birther, he’s not legitimate, now we’re not going to give him a chance to name a supreme court nominee. ” Ryan responded, “Of course, yeah. I call it blacklash. He is the first black president, and there’s a segment of society, and even some on the Hill, who don’t like the fact that he is there, and he’s almost finished his term, and they don’t want him to have a legacy piece. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
