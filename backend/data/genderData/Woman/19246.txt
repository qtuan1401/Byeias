The father of alleged Palm Springs shooter John Felix ran to a neighbor’s house and warned that his son wanted to kill cops just prior to three Palm Springs officers being shot. [Two of those officers, Jose Gilbert Vega and Lesley Zerebny, were killed.  According to the Los Angeles Times, Felix is a    man who allegedly opened fire on three officers responding to a “family disturbance” call. Frances Serrano lives in a neighboring home and she said Felix’s father came over just before the shooting, frantically seeking help. She said Felix’s dad said, “Help. I need help. My son is in the house, and he’s crazy. He has a gun. He’s ready to shoot all the police. ’” Serrano said Felix’s father “was very nervous” and “afraid of his son. ” Serrano responded by placing a 911 call. Minutes later, she heard gun shots. Fox News quoted Palm Springs police chief Bryan Reyes saying, “It was a simple family disturbance and he elected to open fire on a few of the guardians of the city  …     Palm Springs lost two brave officers  …     I am awake in a nightmare right now. ” Reyes said the three officers were “standing near the front door” talking to Felix when the shooting occurred. He said the officers were “trying to negotiate with the suspect to just comply,” when he allegedly shot them.
