Former wrestling champion Hulk Hogan has won another match against Gawker founder Nick Denton, after a judge sided with Hogan to deny Denton’s bid to lease his $4. 25 million Manhattan apartment. [“It is quite understandable that [Mr. Denton] does not want to sell his former home,” said Hogan’s lawyer, however leasing the $4. 25 million apartment at $12, 500 per month would still not be a justified decision to pay his dues versus selling the property for its full worth, judged the bankruptcy court.  Gawker Media was sold to Univision after both the news outlet and Denton were forced to file for bankruptcy after being ordered by the courts to pay $140 million to Hogan for posting a clip from his sex tape without permission. The company’s main site, Gawker. com, was shut down on Monday with a final goodbye post from Denton. The post featured Hogan’s name seventeen times and the lawsuit’s financial backer Peter Thiel’s name   times. Denton is currently living in a cheaper property.
