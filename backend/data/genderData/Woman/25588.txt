Students at Clemson University are already planning protests for Milo Yiannopoulos’s talk at the university, two months before the talk is scheduled to take place. [The talk, which takes place on 15th October, has already caught the eye of some of the university’s   activists, with one student named Ian Anderson posting on Twitter: “Can we please shut him down,” before adding that “there’s no way in hell that he’s coming near this school” for what he claims will be a “white power rally. ”  Anderson, who has locked his Twitter account due to “harassment and security concerns,” was consequently supported by other leftist students, with one student describing WeRoar, the organisation hosting the talk, as “f***ing privileged white males,” on a Clemson sub Reddit. Another anonymous student outlined their plans to hold a protest at the talk, saying “We don’t need any more racist, sexist, xenophobic bigots here at Clemson. We already have enough. “I’ve already begun the protest planning —  drums, whistles, posters, and chants. ” The talk was “more proof that we need fewer white people at Clemson,” to “rectify the already radically   environment,” they continued. Talking to Campus Reform, WeRoar member Kyle Brady said that “College students are unable to emotionally cope with ideas that conflict with their own,” adding that “Milo shatters this idea of   and sounds a wake up call to millennials across the nation. ” Milo Yiannopoulos’s ‘Dangerous Faggot Tour’ returns on September 12th, with the opening talk at Texas Tech University.
