.@newtgingrich: How many Americans must die before Obama will tell the truth about threat from radical Islamists? https:  .  Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( ) criticized President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for their reluctance to mention the threat Islamic supremacy poses to the United States.  Gingrich pointed to Obama and Clinton’s willingness to lie about Benghazi and said the suggested the same sort of thing is happening when it comes to the Orlando shooting early Sunday that resulted in 50 deaths and 53 suffering from injuries. “The fact is President Obama and Secretary Clinton lied to us about Benghazi,” Gingrich said. “We know that as a fact. They lied for over a week. It was deliberate and minacious and they knew it. The fact is they’re both misleading us on Orlando. And deep down they know it. The question is how many of our Americans have to die before Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton decide they can tell the truth about the threat to the United States from Islamic supremacists. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
