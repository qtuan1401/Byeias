COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP)  —   Sweden’s education minister wants to ban   classes after last year’s public outcry after a Muslim school was allowed to separate boys and girls for gym classes. [Gustav Fridolin says “if there are problems by having boys and girls together, you should take care of the problem, not avoid it simply by separating the sexes. ”  Fridolin, a member of Sweden’s   minority government, told Swedish Radio Saturday that too many schools “have been given temporary permission to have boys and girls apart for several years. ”
