George Washington University Law School Professor John Banzhaf returned to Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM to discuss the attempts by GWU to “muzzle” an upcoming appearance at the university of Breitbart Tech Editor Milo Yiannopoulos. [“I think they’re trying to muzzle him,” Banzhaf told Breitbart    and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. “And I see it as a vital test of GW’s commitment to academic freedom, the one that [it] grants to students, as well as speakers, in our statement of student rights and responsibilities. This is kind of an end run around that. ”  Banzhaf was speaking about an issue he explained in an article titled “Milo Event At GWU Rescheduled (To Worse [T]ime Slot) Without Any Notice“:  It now appears that the time of the event announced below has been suddenly changed at the last minute to 5: :30 PM from the originally scheduled 7: :00 PM time, although no notification was sent to ticket holders showing the old time, and there was no announcement anywhere else. Thus, for reasons still unknown, it seems that many students eager to hear this controversial speaker will be very disappointed. Also, students are likely to be discouraged from attending by the change to a less favorable time, and the slashing of the total time for his appearance. The time change will also probably mean little or no QA at the end a very popular feature with many students. “This could be a clever but underhanded tactic by a university which has received international condemnation for its recent infringement of student rights and religious freedom to appear to honor its stated commitment to academic freedom by not disinviting a controversial speaker, but at the same time severely limiting his ability to be heard,” says public interest law professor John Banzhaf, adding that only time will tell.
