Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders argued that “real unemployment is close to 10%” during Thursday’s “PBS NewsHour” Democratic presidential debate.  Sanders said, “I do believe that in the year 2016, we have to look in terms of public education, as colleges  —   as part of public education, making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10% and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan, comes to mind, our wastewater plants, our rail, our airports, in many places, are disintegrating, yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, at a cost of a trillion dollars. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
