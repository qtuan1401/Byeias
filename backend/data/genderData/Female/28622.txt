The conservative nonprofit group Citizens United is comparing Bill Clinton’s lurid history with women to that of accused serial rapist Bill Cosby. [Clinton, who has been photographed schmoozing with Cosby on multiple occasions, is coming under fire for his alleged rape of Juanita Broaddrick in the 1970s.  Broaddrick said in a tweet to this reporter that she was audited in 2000, while Clinton was president, and she has also claimed that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate and silence her to prevent political fallout from the alleged crime. Similarly, a female New Hampshire state legislator who confronted Hillary Clinton over the Broaddrick allegations was intimidated by the Secret Service and is now getting threats on her safety and the safety of her children. The Citizens United video uses audio of Broaddrick describing the alleged rape scene to Breitbart’s Jerusalem Bureau Chief Aaron Klein.  In her first interview in nearly a decade, Broaddrick spoke exclusively on Klein’s weekend talk radio program in November. Cosby, meanwhile, is on trial for allegedly drugging a woman and taking advantage of her sexually. The onetime “Kids Say The Darndest Things” star has been accused by numerous women of similar acts. “We saw what Hillary Clinton is doing, trying to make this election about women and women’s issues,” Citizens United president David Bossie told Breitbart News. “We just wanted to make everybody see that there’s no major difference between the two. The abuse of power, and the attacks on the women. ” “If they want to wear [women’s issues] out on their sleeve, they need to confront the real history, not their invented history. ”
