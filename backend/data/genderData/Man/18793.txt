A    boy from Spain received a €100, 000 bill after confusing Google AdWords with Google AdSense when he wanted to make money from  on his YouTube channel. [José Javier and his friend, who run a YouTube channel for their local band, aimed to “get rich and buy a mansion” by signing up for Google AdSense adverts on their videos, before being hit with a   bill for the adverts they had placed instead.  “My son did not know what he did. Now [he] has become the most famous [at] high school and his mother goes on television,” said the boy’s father, who had prepared a lawyer for the case before Google made their statement. “I tell him if he knows the possible consequences of what he has done, but apparently does not realize [what’s] going to happen. We are more realistic. ” Google AdSense allows users to monetize their content, including YouTube videos and websites, while AdWords allows users to advertise their own content or product around the internet. “[We] will proceed to cancel the outstanding balance of AdWords,” said Google in a statement, acknowledging that the purchase had been made by mistake. “Many online services, including Google AdWords, have age restrictions on use,” they continued, before providing a link to their family safety center.
