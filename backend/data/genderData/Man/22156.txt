In appearance on Fox News Channel on Sunday, Breitbart National Security senior editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka reacted to the mass shooting in Orlando, FL early Sunday morning resulting in the deaths of 50 people and 53 injured.  The shooter, identified as    Omar Mateen, is believed to have pledged an allegiance to the radical terrorist group ISIS, to which Gorka argued is evidence that the war has come to the United States. “In the past 15 years, we haven’t seen an Episcopalian suicide bomber,” he said. “We haven’t seen Zoroastrian mass murderers. We’ve seen Muslim extremists. If you deny that, you are in a fantasy land, and you’re endangering American citizens. ” “It’s time to wake up, America,” he added. “The war is here. ” (  Fox News Insider) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
