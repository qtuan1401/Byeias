During testimony before Congress on Thursday, FBI Director James Comey stated that the FBI’s interview with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was not under oath or recorded, but it still would be a crime to lie to the FBI.  Comey stated that he did not personally interview Clinton, and did not talk to all of the “five or six” who did interview Clinton. He was then asked, “did she testify or talk to them under oath?” Comey answered, “No. ” But added that “it’s still a crime to lie to us. ” When asked if there was a transcript of the interview, Comey stated that there wasn’t one because the interview wasn’t recorded, but there was an analysis of Clinton’s interview.
