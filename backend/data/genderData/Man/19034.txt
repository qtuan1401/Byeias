Disney released the final trailer for its upcoming Rogue One: A Star Wars Story over the weekend in preparation for the film’s release on December 16. [The latest and last trailer gives fans a few more shots of the Death Star, which is still under construction in the film, and of the ragtag group of Rebels who are tasked with destroying it.  Rogue One stars Felicity Jones, Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker, Diego Luna, Alan Tudyk, Warwick Davis, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen and Ben Mendelsohn. James Earl Jones reprises his role as Darth Vader. The film  —   the first in a series of planned spinoffs of the original saga  —   is directed by Gareth Edwards (Godzilla) off of a script from Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass). This weekend also saw the release of a Rogue One TV spot that at least one   viewer believes teases the return of another one of the original trilogies’ most iconic villains.
