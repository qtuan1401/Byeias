’  ’ ”   The housing market’s comeback after the financial crisis has   turned out to be a mixed bag. ” ’   Prices have recovered to    levels. But with slow   wage growth, that means there are fewer affordable houses   available to buyers, especially in bigger cities.  ’ ’   On the surface, the price trend ought to be good news for   existing homeowners looking to sell. However, the likely rise in   mortgage rates from historic lows means that there will be less   incentive to move, according to  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   Since the 1980s, the   drop in interest rates created a     incentive to move, Fleming said. Even if a seller’s   income was unchanged, it was possible to effectively move into a   lower mortgage rate, and so be able to even afford a slightly   bigger home.  ” ’  ’ ”   Now, the likelihood that rates will rise from historic lows has   spurred the   rate   effect: homeowners don’t sell   because of the perceived or actual difference in their monthly   mortgage payments if they swap their old rate for a new, higher   one, Fleming said. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   In some cases, like when a homeowner is moving, the sell   decision is easier to make, if not obligatory. Also, there’s   a level of   appreciation that makes selling an   attractive prospect. ” ’   The question, according to Fleming, then becomes whether new   homes can be built quickly enough to catch housing stock up   to demand. ’ ”   This gap has created the most competitive buyers’ market on   record for existing homes, judging by how long homes stay listed,   according to the National Association of Realtors. In April,   existing homes listed for a   median of 29 days, the NAR    on Wednesday. Shorter listing times suggest buyers are   snapping up houses as quickly as possible, indicating a hot   market. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ”The housing market’s comeback after the. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
