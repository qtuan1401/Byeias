During a Monday “First Take” discussion about the sportsmanship shown by Masters winner Sergio Garcia and   Justin Rose this weekend, ESPN personality Max Kellerman said that he does not believe golf is a sport.  “[G]olf’s whole status as a sport is a conversation for another day I guess,” Kellerman argued. He explained, “I would define a sport as a competition through which you can accurately gauge the athleticism of its participants. And I don’t think that’s the case with golf   …     this ain’t Ali going at Frazier. They’re not throwing punches. They’re not tackling each other. They’re not in each other’s way. Golf is not a zero sum game. It’s more like a standardized test. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
