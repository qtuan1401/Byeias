’  ’ ’     Russian hackers appear to be behind attacks on   voter databases in Arizona and Illinois. The incidents are a   stark reminder of, even when hackers use fairly standard tools. But the   greatest threat to American democracy isn’t technical in nature,   security experts say —  it’s psychological. ’ ’   In a warning the  it suggested that voter   databases in two states had been attacked by hackers, and as many   as 200, 000 voter records look to have been stolen in the attack   on the Illinois voter database. In Arizona, one employee’s login   information was compromised after the person downloaded   malware, but no information was stolen. ’ ’   Reporting on the incidents has mostly focused on the worry that   hackers could foul up an election by tapping into databases and   deleting voter registration records. But voter databases . And even if   records were deleted, any voters whose records weren’t on file   when they showed up at a polling station could still that could then be   verified. ’ ’   The greater threat, then,  is what might   happen if voters lose confidence in the nation’s electoral   process: ’ ’   “The thing that I’m worried about is not the technical disruption   of the election itself. That’s still extremely unlikely,” says   [cybersecurity researcher Thomas Rid of King’s College in   London]. “The pattern we see is to call things into question, to   sow doubt, to create uncertainty. This could be another way to   create uncertainty in the minds of a lot of people   …     You can’t   patch this psychological vulnerability. ” ’ ’   It’s understandable that concerns around election security would   be high, especially after Russian hackers stole   from the   Democratic National Committee and used them to embarrass the   party during its convention earlier this summer. These latest   incidents are indeed worrisome. But not, perhaps, for the reasons   we might at first think. ’
