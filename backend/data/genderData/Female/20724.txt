Diane Haslett Rudiano, who is at the center of an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) over the mysterious purging of voter rolls in Brooklyn, was involved in a recent lucrative real estate transaction with Hillary Clinton’s political allies that bagged her a whopping 1, 000 percent return on her investment. [Rudiano, who served as chief clerk of the Board of Elections in Brooklyn, oversaw the removal of more than 102, 000 voters from the rolls in Brooklyn between November 1, 2015 and April 1, 2016 in the run up to the Democratic primary in New York state. On April 19, Hillary Clinton won Kings County, where Brooklyn is located, by more than 57, 000 votes.  Rudiano was suspended immediately from her position with the Board of Elections over “widespread irregularities” in Brooklyn voting, reported the Wall Street Journal. Schneiderman announced immediately after the primary vote an investigation into voting problems: “I am deeply troubled by the volume and consistency of voting irregularities, both in public reports and direct complaints to my office’s voter hotline. ” Barely a year before those voter purges began, Rudiano was involved in a real estate transaction with powerful Clinton allies that netted her an astonishing 1, 003  percent profit. In September 2014, Rudiano sold a brownstone that she had bought for $5, 000 in 1976 for $6. 6 million. The property, which included collapsed floors, crumbing bannisters and cracked stonework, was bought by an investment group called Holliswood 76, LLC. Who runs Holliswood? That would be Dana Lowey Luttway, a developer and daughter of U. S. Congressman Nita Lowey. Weeks after that real estate transaction went through, Lowey endorsed Hillary Clinton for President. Congressman Lowey is a   Hillary Clinton friend and political ally. Lowey is also a Superdelegate to the Democratic National Convention and has pledged her support to Hillary Clinton.
