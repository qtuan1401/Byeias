Friday, the “T. D. Jakes Show” posted a preview clip for an interview that will air next Thursday in which talk show host Oprah Winfrey told pastor T. D. Jakes that you don’t have to like Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to vote for her.  Winfrey said, “There really is no choice, people. All the people sitting around talking about they can’t decide. This is what I wanna say  —   wait a minute. I hear this all the time. You get into conversations  —   and there’s not a person in this room who hasn’t been in this same conversation —   where people say, ‘I just don’t know if I like her.’ She’s not coming over to your house. You don’t have to like her. You don’t have to like her. Do you like this country? Do you like this country? You better get out there and vote. Do you like the country? Do you like freedom and liberty? Do you like this country? OK. Do you like democracy or do you want a demagogue?” (  RCP Video) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
