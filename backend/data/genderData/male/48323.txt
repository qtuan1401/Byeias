’   If you watch HBO’’s ”Silicon Valley,” then you may remember a now   classic scene  —   below  —   from the most recent season, where our   hero, Richard Hendricks, ends his relationship with a   Facebook engineer over her programming style. ’ ’   The  as presented in HBO’’s ”Silicon   Valley,” is real. Developers have been arguing over using tabs   versus spaces for formatting their code for almost as long as the   concept of programming has existed. ’ ’   At stake is the aesthetics of the code itself: Does putting a tab   after each new line make it more readable? Or do you just push   the space bar a few times? ’ ’ ’ ’   A more detailed explanation of the    debate   can be found . ’ ’   And so, . By analyzing a   billion files, taken from the 400, 000 top programming projects on   the GitHub social network for software developers, representing   14 terabytes of data all told, he was able to see who was using   tabs and who was using spaces in most major programming   languages. ’ ’   You can  but the end   result is bad news for the   Hendricks. ’ ’   Check it out: ’ ’  ’ ”   As you can see, spaces far outpace tabs in every major   programming language with the exceptions of C,  and Google’s Go, an upstart of a programming language   that’s finding fans among people writing software for the server. ” ”   This doesn’t exactly prove which one is better, but it shows the   way that programmers are working in real life. And in most ways   that matter, it seems that the debate is already over. ”
