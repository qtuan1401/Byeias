’  ’ ’   New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Vice President Joe Biden headed to   Queens on Tuesday afternoon to break ground on the renovation of   LaGuardia Airport, a $4 billion   partnership that   was   ’ ’  ’ ”     The vice president, who gave a long and rambling speech about     America’s role in the world, did not point to the example of     American exceptionalism right there on the podium: Cuomo’s     astoundingly bad train project.   ” ’     The Air Train, which the governor first proposed in January of     2015, will link the waterfront airport with subway and Long     Island Railroad stops at Willets Point, in Queens. Contrary to     some news reports, it did not break ground on Tuesday. But why     is it still part of the LaGuardia Airport plan at all?   ’ ”     New York City needs this train like a fish needs a bicycle. It     would be an egregious misuse of money and initiative, in a city     whose everyday transit functions are at capacity, to extend     such a gift to airport travelers, of all people. But then, it’s     not a gift at all: The Cuomo Train is that rare project that     both has the wrong goals and fails to meet them. (Two     wrongs don’t make a right, in this case.)   ” ”     I had hoped the train might have been forgotten. As originally     proposed, it certainly looked like an    throwaway     Photoshopped by an intern in Albany. But the governor’s     assurances on   with MTA chief Thomas     Prendergast’s last       that he really does plan to build it. You wouldn’t have known     it: There has been no comparison of alternative routes or     methods, or any serious public analysis at all. (An Airport     Advisory Panel, whose head was appointed by the governor,      the idea a       sentence of approval last summer.)   ” ’     Any semblance of study would have unearthed what Yonah Freemark      when the plan was     announced back in 2015: For almost all New Yorkers, the $450     million Cuomo Train will actually be a slower way to     get to the airport than existing transit services.   ’ ’  ’ ”     Airport transit proposals tend to be designed for       professionals, and this plan is no exception: Its calling card     will be the link to the city’s major midtown train stations,     Penn Station and Grand Central. To  transit designer     Jarrett Walker, it’s obvious that LaGuardia’s 11, 000 airport     workers, traveling twice a day, make more annual transit trips     than 500, 000 professionals traveling three or four times a     year.   ” ”     But the plan doesn’t reflect that logic. Most LaGuardia workers      in Western Queens, East     Harlem, Upper Manhattan, and the Bronx. This train isn’t for     them.   ” ”     Whom would it help, then? The trip from Penn Station to the     Cuomo Train is 16 minutes, and if the Cuomo Train takes another     10 minutes, the total journey will be less than half an hour.     But all you need is Google Maps to see that the transit trip     from Penn Station to LaGuardia, using the airport bus from     Woodside, can already be made in less than half an     hour. (It’s not an accident that all previous Air Train ideas     for LaGuardia had the train coming from the airport’s       west or south, not, as Cuomo’s plan has it, from the     east.)   ” ”     The governor has his eye on  the megaproject     that will link Grand Central Terminal to the Long Island     Railroad, or LIRR, in 2022. But here’s the thing: LIRR trains     only run past the Cuomo Train site every   on weekday     afternoons. If those trains get evenly divided between     Manhattan’s two major train stations, you’re looking at one     express train per hour heading for the airport from each     corner of Midtown.   ” ’  ’ ”     That’s pathetic, but the   the tunnels with     empty commuter trains to cart a few travelers to the       worse. (If you’re taking the subway, the bus from Woodside is     much faster.)   ” ”       The groundbreaking of the new airport will prompt another       round of comparisons between Cuomo and Robert Moses, New       York’s midcentury master builder. There is one way in which       Cuomo seems to have inherited the Moses legacy. The       midcentury planner was largely concerned with getting people       in and out of New York City, with little       regard for how his solutions would affect the city itself.     ” ’       Cuomo has that mentality too. He left New York City years       ago, and nearly every grand urban project he has         Penn Station to the Long Island Rail Road to         to aim to help more people do the same.     ’ ’New York Gov.
