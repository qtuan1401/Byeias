’  ’ ’   The legend of Aaron Rodgers grew in the divisional round of the   NFL playoffs when he converted a long pass in the closing   seconds of the win over the Cowboys by simply making up a play,   on the fly in the huddle, as if the Packers were just   playing in the backyard. ’ ”   On Wednesday, Rodgers was a guest on ESPN Radio’s  and he   explained what went on both prior to the big play and as it   was unfolding. ” ’   When Rodgers was asked about reports that he had just made up the   final play, he explained that what he told his players was even   more basic than anybody realized. ’ ’   ”I said everybody kinda run over to the left and get open,”   Rodgers told Le Batard. ”Not exactly in those words, but that was   basically the gist of it.” ’ ’ ’ ’   Prior to this, there was a general assumption that Rodgers had at   least given his receivers specific routes to run. ’ ’   Rodgers went on to explain that head coach Mike McCarthy gives   him the freedom to call his own plays in certain situations.   However, when Rodgers was asked how often he just makes up a   play  —   as opposed to picking from a group of plays he and   McCarthy had picked out  ’ ’   Rodgers also noted that he decided to go rogue during such a   huge moment because, ”the best plays are often the simplest plays   and the simplest way of explaining them.” ’ ’   Well, it worked. Jared Cook ran across the field to the left and   made a spectacular catch, gaining 36 yards on the third down, and   setting up the   field goal. ’ ’ ’ ’   And now the Packers are one step closer to the Super Bowl. ’
