Frutos had earlier told France Info radio station that he would not invite Eagles of Death Metal back to the Bataclan, after Hughes made accusations about its security.

In   strikes that night, other gunmen and suicide bombers targeted a soccer stadium and several cafes in Paris. In all, the Islamic State militants killed 130 people.
