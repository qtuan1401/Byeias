Twitter has reversed one of its new   features following complaints that it encouraged even more abuse on the platform. [After Twitter announced on Monday that a new   feature would stop notifying users when they’d been added to a list, several complaints started to immediately gain traction.  We want you to get notifications that matter. Starting today, you won’t get notified when you are added to a list. https:  .   —   Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) February 13, 2017,  “Being added to a list and knowing what list you were added to was literally the last useful thing about Twitter,” complained one user. @TwitterSafety Being added to a list and knowing what list you were added to was literally the last useful thing about Twitter.  —   Anthony Quintano 🌴 (@AnthonyQuintano) February 13, 2017,  “This isn’t a good move.

The changes reportedly include extra measures to stop suspended users from creating new accounts, “safer search results,” and the collapsing of “potentially abusive or   Tweets. ” “In the days and weeks ahead, we will continue to roll out product changes  —   some changes will be visible and some less so  —   and will update you on progress every step of the way,” declared Twitter in their post. “With every change, we’ll learn, iterate, and continue to move at this speed until we’ve made a significant impact that people can feel. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
