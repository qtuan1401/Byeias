During an interview with NBC News Senior Investigative Correspondent Cynthia McFadden for “Dateline on Assignment” broadcast on Wednesday’s “MSNBC Live,” Marcel Lazăr Lehel, the hacker known as “Guccifer,” stated that he had access to Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email server, which he described as “like an open orchid. ”  Guccifer said, per a translator, that Clinton’s server was unprotected, and he had total access to the server that “was like an open orchid on the Internet, as many such servers are. ” McFadden added that Guccifer told her he had downloaded things from the server, but couldn’t provide those materials since he was in prison. She continued that an FBI official she spoke to on camera said that Guccifer had admitted to a federal crime on camera, and questioned why he would do so if it wasn’t true.
