Truth is, no one can really replace Beyoncé. But at Coachella this year, Lady Gaga will take her spot. The festival announced late Tuesday that Lady Gaga would perform instead of Beyoncé on the second night of its   event in Indio, Calif. over two successive weekends, April   and    —   giving Lady Gaga a headlining spot at the biggest and most influential American music festival just two months after she performed for 117. 5 million viewers at the Super Bowl halftime show. This year’s festival will also be headlined by Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar. Beyoncé, who is pregnant with twins, announced last Thursday that she was dropping out of this year’s event “following the advice of her doctors,” news that drew lots of devastated tweets from her fans and a sharp price drop for Coachella tickets on the scalping market. (She is to return as a headliner next year.) A number of major acts had been rumored as possible replacements for Beyoncé, including Rihanna, Chance the Rapper, Daft Punk and even Jay Z, her husband. But the selection of Lady Gaga preserves at least one aspect of Beyoncé’s booking: a major female pop star known for playing to the crowds with a big, choreographed production, something entirely new to the Coachella stage.
