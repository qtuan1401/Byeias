Actress Tina Fey, who was once thought to have “swung” the 2008 election toward Obama with her Sarah Palin impersonation, is sounding off about how much she loathes the “ugly” nature of presidential politics in 2016. [“I hate them all,” Fey said of the current candidates, in recent interview in Town  Country magazine.  Fey says the 2008 presidential election was “genteel” compared to today’s. “It’s funny until it isn’t. It’s gotten kind of ugly,” the Saturday Night Live alum said. Fey is described by Town  Country magazine as a “longtime independent. ” While not giving any formal endorsements, Fey did shower praise on Hillary Clinton in 2008 during a sketch on Saturday Night Live.  Fey questioned why women were voting for Barack Obama and not Clinton. She thought it might be because the   York senator was a “bitch”. “Let me say something about that,” Fey said in 2008. “She is a bitch. And so am I. Bitches get stuff done. That’s why Catholic Schools use nuns instead of priests. At the end of the year you hated those bitches, but you knew the capital of Vermont. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
