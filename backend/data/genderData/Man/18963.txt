Police in Easton, Pennsylvania interrupted a local high school substitute teacher in the act of having sexual relations with a teenaged student in the parking lot of a cemetery, according to reports. [Kelly Aldinger, a substitute teacher at Easton Area High School, was discovered in the cemetery parking lot with a    student earlier this month. She appeared before District Judge Daniel Corpora this week where she was charged with institutional sexual assault and ordered held on $50, 000 bail.  After her arrest, the school reported that her substitute teaching contract has been canceled. Court records show that on May 6 police came upon the teacher’s car in the parking lot of Easton Cemetery at around 1 PM. When the officer walked up to the auto he discovered the teacher and student in a compromised position. Upon questioning, the student told officers that he and the woman had been in a sexual relationship since the fall of 2015 when he was a    student in the woman’s class. In court, the suspect admitted that she is no longer employed. “The assignments that she had lined up until the end of the year have been terminated. So I don’t know what that will mean for her in the future pending on the disposition of the charges,” Aldinger’s attorney said. Cemetery Superintendent Jeff Mutchler said the facility has had problems with people using the cemetery for reasons other than mourning loved ones in the past and will be putting surveillance cameras in to try to deter future violators. Aldinger was also a   leader at St. Paul’s III Lutheran Church of Palmer Township. Rev. Chris Drunkenmiller said the church is praying for her but other wise had no other comments on her situation.
