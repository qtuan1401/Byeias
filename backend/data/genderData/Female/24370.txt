In the wake of the heinous Sunday morning attack that took the lives of three Baton Rouge police officers, East Baton Rouge Sheriff Gautreaux stressed that the attack was not a gun issue as much as it was an issue of the heart.  CNN reports the three officers were shot and killed after responding to a suspicious persons call on Sunday morning. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards (D) described the shooting as “an unspeakable and unjustified attack on all of us at a time when we need unity and healing,” WAFB tweeted a statement from Sheriff Gautreaux, which said: “This is not so much about gun control as it is about what’s in men’s hearts. ” The Guardian reports that this was just a portion of a larger statement, in which he said: With God’s help, we will get through this. To me this is not so much about gun control as it is about what’s in men’s hearts. And until we come together as a nation, as a people, to heal as a people. If we don’t do that and this madness continues, we will surely perish as a people. Baton Rouge has been a powder keg of tensions since the   shooting of Alton Sterling. An investigation into that shooting is ongoing. Suspects are still being sought in the Sunday morning shooting of the three officers. The number of   suspects is unreported.
