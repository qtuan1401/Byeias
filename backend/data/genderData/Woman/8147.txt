On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Messy Truth with Van Jones,” host Van Jones argued that “sometimes liberals are too  ” about standing up to Islamic fundamentalism.  Jones said to his guest, HBO’s “Real Time” host Bill Maher, “[Y]ou and I actually agree a lot on the need to be tough on these fundamentalists. And I think that sometimes liberals are too   about standing up. And at the same time, I think even somebody who is very concerned about the bad part of Islam has to be excited about the good part of Islam. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
