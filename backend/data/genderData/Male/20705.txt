BATON ROUGE, Louisiana  —   Attorneys handling a lawsuit filed against the city of Baton Rouge by #BlackLivesMatter protester DeRay Mckesson announced that a settlement may soon be reached between the two parties. The lawsuit challenged their arrests during a protest in the area that followed an   shooting of a black man. [There could be an “agreement in principle to amicably resolve the matter,” according to a court order obtained by the Associated Press (AP).

The police have been violent tonight. The protesters have not. ” Soon after, BRPD officers can be heard shouting “This is the police, you’re under arrest! Don’t fight me! Don’t fight me!” “I’m under arrest, y’all,” DeRay said on the   while being apprehended by police.
