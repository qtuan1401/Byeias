Last night we learned that Jeff Sessions, the attorney general of the United States, lied under oath to his colleagues in the Senate and to the American people about his communications with the Russians. There are standard of professional conduct for attorneys, especially the top law enforcement officer in our country. ” “What is the message that that sends to the country, to the lawyers in the State Department, to the American Bar Association, which has standards of moral and professional conduct, to the state of Alabama, which has standard for professional conduct for its attorneys?” she continued. “The fact that the attorney general, the top cop in our country, lied under oath to the American people is grounds for him to resign. It’s grounds for him to resign. He has proved that he is unqualified and unfit to serve in that position of trust. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
