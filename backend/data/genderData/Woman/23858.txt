Friday in Washington, D. C. at the shared convention for the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton promised ‪ not to deport “  people. ”  When answering a question about immigration, Clinton said, “We lost a lot of the leverage because we lost the House of Representatives. So nothing happens easily or quickly in modern politics in America, but here’s what I know. As I have said, we are not going to be deporting   people and break up families. I’ve been on record for a year and a half about this, and that will be how I direct the Department of Homeland Security to act. We are going to push on immigration reform and I will need not only a considerable vote in November, but I will need people across our country to make it clear to their elected representatives that they are going to be held accountable for how they are going to act on immigration reform. If we put enough organizing and political effort into this, I am optimistic and I believe we can get this done. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
