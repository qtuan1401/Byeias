’  ’ ’   There wasn’’t much of a fight put up by the newbies to the   multiplex, ”The BFG” and ”The Legend of Tarzan,” as    ’’s ”Finding Dory” is No. 1 at the US box office for a   third consecutive week, with an estimated $41. 9 million,   according to . ’ ’   By the time the Fourth of July holiday wraps, ”Dory” will have   earned over $50 million over the long weekend and a domestic   total of over $370 million, putting it on track to be one of the   biggest animated sequels. ’ ’   The latest attempt to bring Tarzan to the screen did better than   most projected, with a second place  earning over three days and   around $45 million by Monday, but that’’s still not enough to make   up the $180 million it cost to make ”The Legend of Tarzan.” It   will certainly need help from the foreign box office. ’ ’   While Steven Spielberg’’s   adaptation of Roald Dahl’’s   ”The BFG” didn’’t bring in the crowds Disney hoped for its first   collaboration with the legendary filmmaker, as it took in just   $19. 6 million ($23. 6 million by Monday) according to Variety, to   come in fourth place. ’ ’  ’ ’   It was the   ”The Purge: Election Year” that made   more than   ”BFG,” as it came in third place with    ($34. 01 million over    ). ’ ’   This holiday weekend has all the makings of a repeat of last   year’’s, where holdovers like ”Inside Out” and ”Jurassic World”   beat out the ”big” holiday release, ”Terminator Genisys.” ’ ’   So it looks like with Hollywood having a sequel problem this   summer it also has an issue with landing huge hit titles on big   holiday weekends over the summer. ’ ’   After a   summer last year, with failed sequels and     originals this year, revenue for the quarter is down   10% compared to this time last year, according to . ’ ’   It will up to upcoming movies like ”The Secret Life of Pets,”   ”Ghostbusters,” ”Jason Bourne,” and ”Suicide Squad,” to bring   this summer movie season back to respectability. ’
