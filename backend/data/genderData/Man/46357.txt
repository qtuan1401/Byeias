’’ ’Ride sharing is supposed to strike fear in heart of the auto industry.’ ’Who needs to buy a car when you can have mobility on demand?’ ”According to Deutsche Bank, startups such as Uber and Lyft may shake up business as usual, but the outcome won’t be as dire as some pundits have predicted.” ’”The consensus view amongst investors is that a decline in the total population of vehicles will lead to a decline in annual vehicle sales,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a recent note. ”We believe that this is wrong. ”’ ’They continued: ”Annual sales will likely increase and the Auto Industry may also become somewhat less cyclical. ”’ ”Here’s the gist of that argument: Ride sharing, as it grows, will increase physical demands on cars, leading to earlier retirement and replacement of these vehicles. A lot of trips taken by these cars will be   as drivers get from a   to the next pickup.” ”Deutsche Bank says the average NYC Taxi is unoccupied 51% of the time, and the typical UberX vehicle isn’t far off that mark.” ”So the view here is that the professional drivers will be replacing cars far more often than the typical car buyer. And those replacements will take place regardless of what’s going on in the broader economy. You can put off buying a new car for a few years if you’re worried about your job, but you can’t if the car is your job.” ’If that holds, it would solve a big problem for the auto industry.’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’Ride sharing is supposed to strike fear in. ..’
