Can’t really bring myself to like the Wonder Woman trailer since Gal Gadot is an outspoken Zionist who boasted about killing Palestinians.  —   Adila. (@adilaislamb) July 24, 2016,  The comments come in response to Gadot’s military service, where she spent a mandatory two years in the Israeli Defense Force. Gadot has been vocally supportive of the Israeli military since her service and has been criticized frequently for it. “I am sending my love and prayers to my fellow Israeli citizens” wrote Gadot in a Facebook post two years ago. “Especially to all the boys and girls who are risking their lives protecting my country against the horrific acts conducted by Hamas, who are hiding like cowards behind women and children  …    We shall overcome! !! Shabbat Shalom! #weareright #freegazafromhamas #stopterror #coexistance #loveidf”. The post received over 200, 000 likes in support, but started a very bitter group of critics against Gadot’s work. Simply searching “Gadot Zionist” on Twitter will reveal dozens of tweets against the actress, with some users even declaring a boycott on Gadot’s work, and expressing hope that the film gets cancelled. also im feeling more than slightly disillusioned abt wonder woman now that i realize what a vehement zionist gadot is  …      —   Kayleigh Lobdell (@kayleaving) July 25, 2016,  ok wtvr just gonna pretend gal gadot wasnt a zionist combat trainer in the idf so i can enjoy wonder woman,  —   kaitlyn (@ashyrvers) July 25, 2016,  my    watching the new wonder woman trailer ”gal gadot is an   zionist who supports the occupation and oppression of the palest,  —   luke (@lukecolbourne) July 24, 2016,  When you were super pumped for the Wonder Woman movie as its female led but realise Gal Gadot is a Zionist 🙃  —   mhysa (@doseofprose) July 23, 2016,  I wish Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) wasn’t a Zionist who supported the occupation of Palestine thru her IDF work, I would enjoy DC more :   —   ️️ (@alitoosad) July 24, 2016,  I hope Wonder Woman flops bc gal gadot is a Zionist and they recast her,  —   kayla (@solosstyles) July 23, 2016,  when you love wonder woman but gal gadot is a zionist who was in the israeli army and fought against palestinians pic. twitter.   —   woo jiho devotee (@jihowoos) July 23, 2016,  I like Gal Gadot as wonder woman.

(@marvelsrise) July 25, 2016,  The   tweets are somewhat ironic considering a majority of the same people would frequently advocate for such a large movie portraying a strong female lead, however Gadot’s political views distance herself from the crowd, and she now appears to just be another target in the crosshairs of social justice.
