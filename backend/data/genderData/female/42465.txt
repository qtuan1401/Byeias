 (CNN) Three people have died and dozens more are injured after a man drove into a crowd    on purpose, the local government says    Saturday in the Austrian city of Graz. The    male driver intentionally used his vehicle as a weapon, the Graz City Council said in a statement. Roman Sommershsacher, a spokesman for the Austrian city’s government, said the man drove through Graz’s inner city    including into a place where cars are not normally allowed    trying to hit people. One of the three fatalities is a child. At least 34 more people suffered injuries, Sommershsacher said, including ten seriously and one in critical condition. The driver    described as an Austrian citizen with Serbian roots    has been arrested, officials said at a Saturday afternoon press conference. The officials added that they don’t know the man’s motive but do not believe it has anything to do with terrorism. Photos from the scene showed a mangled bike and what appeared to be a body draped by a white sheet. Located in Styria province in southeastern Austria, Graz is that country’s   populous city.
