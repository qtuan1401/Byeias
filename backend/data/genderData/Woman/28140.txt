Wednesday, Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson told The Des Moines Register editorial board there should be “secret shoppers” monitoring government agencies for political bias, inefficiency and unresponsiveness.  Carson said, “I believe in the secret shopper concept for all government agencies. I believe that there should be people out there who are acting as consumers and seeing if we are taking care of them appropriately. ” He added, “Not just classrooms and libraries, but anything that the taxpayers are paying for. We ought to be monitoring it and making sure it is done appropriately. ” On monitoring schools, Carson said, “Basically, when complaints are heard, you know, from students or from other faculty members, you would go in and investigate. You can do that rather surreptitiously. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
