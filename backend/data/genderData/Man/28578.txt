Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid came out to watch his neighbors caucus in his own Henderson precinct, where they overwhelmed Bernie Sanders’ supporters and backed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. [The first round of Reid’s precinct voting went primarily for Clinton with only three people voting for Sanders and 22 people for the former Secretary of State.  But the three Bernie voters did not meet the mandatory minimum of voters to be considered for the award of the two delegates in Nevada’s precinct 1519. That threshold required seven votes in this group or 25 per cent of the 27 eligible voters present. The three   caucus goers were resolved in their support for the Senator and would not relent to join the Clinton ranks. One young woman was invited repeatedly to join the Clinton side but adamantly refused. Her dad caucused for Clinton. A husband and wife were split, one for Sanders and one for Clinton. The husband ended up volunteering as one of the two delegates for Clinton. Breitbart News followed up with wife, Linda   who said, “We depended on Obama to be the savior and he let us down but I think Bernie empowers the people to accomplish change. With Bernie he does inspire me this way. ”   described herself as the more ideological one of the household while her husband is the more pragmatic voter. Reid told the single male Sanders supporter, “Hey young man, if you change, I’m gonna tell Bernie. ” The precinct leader conducting the vote for Reid’s group read statements from Clinton and Sanders ahead of voting. When asked if he wanted his statement read aloud, Reid shook his head and said no. Also, Reid and wife Landra Gould declined to register a vote for either Clinton or Sanders. Reid has not made an endorsement in the Democratic primary race. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
