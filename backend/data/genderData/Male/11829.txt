Oculus Rift “ ” demonstrating the VR headset are shutting down in the hundreds after a lack of public interest has left some of them empty for days at a time. [Nearly half of   demonstrations at Best Buy of the   Oculus Rift are being axed because of “store performance,” according to an internal memo from a   contractor. Oculus spokeswoman Andrea Schubert, however, chalked the dramatic cuts up to “seasonal changes. ”  But even during the height of the holiday season, Best Buy’s designated “Oculus Ambassadors” counted themselves lucky to sell a few units during a week of the otherwise bustling shopping season. Several Best Buy   employees told Business Insider that “it was common for them to go days without giving a single demonstration. ” Nevertheless, Schubert said that Oculus “still [believes] the best way to learn about VR is through a live demo” and asserted that the company is looking for “opportunities to do regular events and  ” in both retail locations and within communities. According to Best Buy, the lack of demo stations won’t stop them from selling the Rift or its peripherals. It was a much more reserved statement than CEO Hubert Joly’s original pitch last year of a “cool and fun” experience with the potential to contribute to Best Buy’s growth as a whole. It sounds like Zuckerberg’s prediction that Oculus “won’t be profitable for a while” is ringing all too true. This is, of course, in addition to the   they’ll be forced to pay Zenimax for the technology’s development as the result of a   legal battle.
