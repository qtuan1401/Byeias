Arizona Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Hillary Clinton supporter, thinks that the Clinton Foundation should be “cut off” due to the    scandal haunting Clinton’s campaign. [“We’ve got to get rid of extraneous issues and if this foundation is an extraneous issue that goes to the heart of whether it’s trust or transparency then get rid of it because there is so much on the table right now for the American people and for the future of this nation, that extraneous issues such as the foundation, if that is something that needs to be cut off then it should be cut off,” Grijalva said in an interview with MSNBC’s Tamron Hall.
