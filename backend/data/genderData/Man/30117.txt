During a rally in Orlando, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lamented the number of black Americans killed by police. [“It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable,” Clinton said, pointing to a “long list of African Americans killed by police officers. ”  She specifically mentioned the death of Keith Lamont Scott, shot by police officers in Charlotte on Tuesday, after he exited the vehicle and refused to drop a handgun in his possession. She also referred to the shooting Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma by police officers. “It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable,” she said. Clinton was careful to point out recent attacks against police officers, including in Philadelphia, and the rioters in Charlotte who injured over a dozen law enforcement officials Tuesday night. “Look, I know I don’t have all the answers, I don’t know anyone who does but this is certain  —   too many people have lost their lives who shouldn’t have,” she said. Clinton called for both citizens and police officers to come together and find a solution to the problem inflaming protesters across the country. “We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities,” she said.
