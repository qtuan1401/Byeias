Tuesday on his radio show, conservative talker and Fox News host Sean Hannity emphasized the importance of Republicans standing up to President Barack Obama on filling the Supreme Court vacancy previously held by the late Antonin Scalia.  Hannity argued based on their previous stands on the court and filling vacancies, Obama and    Senate Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer cannot complain if Republicans stonewall Obama’s nominee until the end of his term. However, he warned vulnerable Republicans to not cave to Obama for sake of political expediency. “Again and again, Barack Obama is in a weaker position than anybody on this planet to insist his nominee is on the court,” Hannity said. “Mr. President, spare us your   lectures and your little political power plays. And you can basically sit down. You’re not involved with this. It’s not up to you. You have no standing to make your case. Your senate career is the only thing Republicans need to cite. And Chuck Schumer, the new senate majority   be, is the only person we need to cite. And to Sen. Schumer, I would say you can take a seat next to Obama and sit down and you can shut up, too, because you have no standing based on your previous hypocritical positions. ” “Now the press is reporting that Senate Republicans who oppose this are taking a political risk, to which I say  —   you know, we have some tough races: Kelly Ayotte, Ron Johnson, Mark Kirk, Pat Toomey, Rob Portman,” he continued. “Well, this nomination is more important than your careers. And if you give in and support Obama, I promise you I will do everything I can do in my power to help anybody that challenges you because it is that important  —   the future of the Court and the future of the Constitution, which are at stake here. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
