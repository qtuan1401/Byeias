Demand for the motion picture adaptation of New York Times bestseller Clinton Cash has soared since its global premiere, with online viewership of the groundbreaking documentary surpassing 3. 5 million. [Views of the film on Breitbart News’ YouTube channel and the Philly Blunt pirated YouTube version have cleared a combined count of more than 3. 5 million views.  The overwhelming popularity of the Clinton Cash documentary  —   directed by M. A. Taylor and written and produced by Danny Fleuette and Stephen K. Bannon  —   was evident after it had garnered more than 500, 000 views online 48 hours after its worldwide release and trended on Facebook for all three days of the Democratic National Convention. Buzz around the film was spurred by the July 26 release of the paperback version of Clinton Cash, as well as the August 8 debut of the Clinton Cash graphic novel. Clinton Cash exposes the alarming pattern of   speaking fees to Bill Clinton and major donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign contributors, which conspicuously coincided with favors for foundation donors while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State. The documentary’s current online view count does not include an accounting of those who have watched the recently released director’s cut of the film, attended watch parties, watched the film during its debut over the weekend on One America News Network or viewed it via myriad other pirated formats. Earlier this month, Clinton Cash premiered on conservative cable news network Newsmax TV, making the film available to more than 40 million American homes.
