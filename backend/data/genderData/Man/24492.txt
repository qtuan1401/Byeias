Purported   outlet PolitiFact has run another Uranium    State Department story first reported by The New York Times (NYT) and based on research from the NYT bestseller Clinton Cash. The article   ignores several key facts and conflicts of interest, potentially damaging to the Democratic presidential nominee. [The most recent Uranium One   article was researched by Tom Kertscher and edited by Greg Borowski. In July, PolitiFact staff writer Linda Qiu published a piece full of factual errors, glaring inaccuracies, and omissions.  Breitbart News published a     refutation of the last Politifact Uranium One piece, which the latest one references. Kertscher’s piece, however, is more of the same sloppy script. Several of the 13 refutation points still apply to this latest “ ” article, but below are two additional points that deserve attention: 1. It’s true that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has nine agencies that approved the sale of American uranium reserves. However, only one of those agencies, the Hillary   State Department, employed a person whose family foundation collected $145 million from investors in the deal  —   an alarming conflict of interest. 2. PolitiFact says, “Given that Russia doesn’t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest uranium producer, our colleagues said. ” However, according to The New York Times, that is patently false. As The New York Times reports, “The commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellow cake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. ” The Times report continues: Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson.
