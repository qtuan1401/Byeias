Columnist Charles Krauthammer argued Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attacking fellow candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) for his criticism of President Obama is a calculated push for   votes in South Carolina by “saying, ‘You’ve disrespected this icon in black American history. ’” on Thursday’s “America’s Election HQ” on the Fox News Channel.  Krauthammer said, “[I]t’s interesting the way that Hillary wrapped herself in Obama. That hasn’t worked up until now. Obama is not popular. Obviously, it hasn’t worked, because it associates her with the status quo. And all sides, Democratic and Republican, are railing against it, and saying how bad our situation is. Nonetheless, her strategy is I think quite specific, pointed at South Carolina. She has to win big there. If not, I think her whole campaign could collapse. It’s heavily   and I think her sense is, her calculation is that in that community, Obama is a source of iconic pride, and when she specifically came after Sanders for his attacks on Obama, I think it was a way of saying, ‘You’ve disrespected this icon in black American history.’ Whether it’ll work or not, I don’t know, but it had a logic to it. ” (  Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
