’    ’ ’ProPublica has an  out Tuesday about the 2013 merger between American   Airlines and US Airways, a display of corporate muscle that shows   all the ways antitrust fights have gone wrong for consumers   during the Obama administration. ’ ’     The revolving door, the influence of corporate money in     politics,   a government outgunned, outmanned, and     outplanned by airline lawyers and lobbyists —  all were present in     the fall of 2013 when the Department of Justice quickly moved     to settle its own case to block the merger.   ’ ’     Among politicians, Justin Elliott’s story reveals, Chicago     Mayor Rahm Emanuel behaved particularly shamefully, publishing     a widely shared letter of support for the merger that .     Later, the Democrat received $53, 000 in   campaign     contributions from American Airlines executives.   ’ ’     Meanwhile, Tom Horne, a Republican then serving as attorney     general in Arizona and a   in the suit, told     ProPublica that lobbyists threatened to spend $500, 000     to unseat him if he didn’t drop the suit. (It was resolved     before his campaign was underway.)   ’ ’       Of course, craven politicians and moneyed lobbyists are a       dime a dozen. The more damaging conclusion is that the DOJ is       woefully vulnerable to the enormous political and financial       pressure of antitrust suits, even in an administration that       claims to be taking a hard line on         consolidation.     ’ ’       As Elliott points out, Obama —  like Hillary Clinton today —  ran       on the promise of renewed antitrust enforcement. But in some       ways, his administration  to George       W. Bush’s lax approach than to Bill Clinton’s. He has also       presided over a   wave of mergers, as companies       combine at nearly three times the rate they did during the       early ’90s.     ’ ’  ’ ’       Globally, 2015 was the  on record for       mergers. The trend has been especially pronounced in the U. S.       As the Economist reported last month, the share of       GDP generated by the 100 biggest U. S. companies is up from 33       percent in 1994 to 46 percent in 2013. The number of listed       U. S. companies fell by half between 1997 and 2013.     ’ ’       Two companies control more than half of all U. S. sales in       beer and in music. Three companies control 99 percent of the       pharmacy business. Following this year’s merger of Charter,       Time Warner, and Bright House, two companies  between 70 and 90       percent of the U. S. broadband industry.     ’ ’       Has the spate of airline mergers, which has left four       companies in control of more than 80 percent of the       commercial   market, hurt consumers? That was the       case made by, well, Attorney General Eric Holder, in August       2013, in a complaint about the AA —  US Airways merger. “The       American people deserve better. This transaction would result       in consumers paying the price —  in higher airfares, higher fees       and fewer choices,” he said.     ’ ’       As you’d expect, the official line is that the massive PR       campaign, the letters, the spending ($275 million from AA       alone on bankruptcy and antitrust lawyers) et al. did not       influence the DOJ’s quick change of heart. “The lobbying       had absolutely no effect on us, and that’s true from the       staff level right up to my boss,” William J. Baer, the head       of the antitrust division,  the New York       Times after the settlement was announced.     ’ ’       But the concessions achieved in the settlement have done       little to challenge the problems that Holder perceived in       airline consolidation that summer. Three years later,       many of his (initial) concerns have been validated. With fuel       prices falling by   in 2014 and 2015, the latter       year was the  in       40 years.     ’ ’       A 10 percent drop in the average fare since 2014 has been       easily countered by $10. 8 billion in fees, up 24 percent in       that time. According to a  prepared by a       former DOJ antitrust lawyer, fares went up 7 to 17 percent in         markets where the AA —  US Airways merger       significantly reduced competition.     ’ ’       Not such a ””       after all.     ’
