Beyoncé ignited a firestorm of controversy when she performed a politically charged concert at the Super Bowl halftime show in February. The concert included a performance of her Black Lives   song “Formation” and featured backup dancers dressed in uniforms of the militant,   Black Panther Party. The pop star followed up her halftime performance with the release of the new “visual” album Lemonade, which again featured Black Lives Matter and other   imagery. Police unions in Florida had vowed to boycott the concerts, but no such boycott or protest reportedly materialized. “The PBA and our chief made it very clear that we were going to staff the concert as we would any other event,” a representative for the Tampa Bay Police Department told local NBC affiliate WFLA. “If an officer felt like they didn’t want to work the event, it’s a voluntary thing, they didn’t have to work that event. ” Beyoncé’s Formation Tour continued Sunday with a   concert in Atlanta, Georgia’s Georgia Dome.
