 (CNN) New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s supporters are in the early stages of starting a leadership political action committee that would serve as an apparatus for him to travel and to hire staff as well start to lay the groundwork for a possible presidential campaign, several sources confirmed to CNN on Tuesday. What’s happening in 2016: Romney and everyone else, The committee is expected to be formed soon, possibly before the end of the month, one supporter told CNN. Such a PAC would allow prospective donors an opportunity to show support for Christie as he mulls launching a campaign. Phil Cox, the former executive director of the Republican Governors Association, is involved in the effort. He worked closely with Christie, who headed the RGA during the last election.  The New York Times first reported the move towards forming the PAC.
