At a Monday campaign event at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno, Nevada, Hillary Clinton barked like a dog to hammer home the point that Republicans are lying about the cause of the Great Recession.  She blasted Republicans for claiming that the “Great Recession was caused by too much regulation on Wall Street. ” Clinton said one of her “favorite, favorite political ads of all time was a radio ad in rural Arkansas where the announcer said, ‘wouldn’t it be great if somebody running for office said something, we could have an immediate reaction whether it is true or not? Well, we’ve trained this dog. And the dog —  if it’s not true, he’s going to bark. ’” “And the dog was barking on the radio,” Clinton said. “And so people were, like, barking at each other for days after that. ” Clinton then said, “I’ve got to figure out how we can do that with the Republicans. We need to get that dog and follow ‘em around. And every time they say these things like, ‘oh, the Great Recession was caused by too much regulation,’ Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!” WATCH: @HillaryClinton barks during story about fact checking Republicans: https:  . :  .   —   ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 16, 2016,
