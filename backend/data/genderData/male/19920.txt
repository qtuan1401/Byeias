Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reacted to the vote by the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union by sounding the alarm over economic uncertainty. [“Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America,” she warned.  Clinton argued that she would be the best choice for president, assuring voters that her experience would help stabilize the world. “This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans’ pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests. ” Clinton also hinted that the United States should reject the nationalistic, economic populist tone that fueled the “leave” vote in Britain. “It also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down,” she said. Clinton made a symbolic gesture to the United Kingdom, recalling the “special relationship” that would continue with the United States. She said she respected the decision by voters.
