The Times of Israel reports:  The IDF on Monday demolished the home of a Palestinian terrorist who murdered an American tourist and injured several other people in a stabbing spree in March. The army said in a statement that it carried out the demolition in the West Bank village of Kafr Haja, near Nablus, in coordination with the Civil Administration and Border Police. Bashar Massalha, 22, from Qalqilya, murdered US citizen Taylor Force and injured 10 others in a rampage along the Jaffa boardwalk on March 8. He was killed by security forces at the scene of the attack, which coincided with a visit by US Vice President Joe Biden, who was meeting with Shimon Peres minutes away from the scene. Last month Israel returned Massalhaâ€™s body to the Palestinian Authority for burial. Read more here.
