Former Department of Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge says it is “unreasonable” to think gun control could have somehow prevented the Orlando terror attack. [He said he does not know what is motivating the Democrats, who keep pushing gun control as an answer to Orlando. “You kind of wonder what kind of glasses some of the Democrats are wearing as they look at that horrible tragedy,” he said.  According to The Hill, Ridge said these things during an interview on “The Cats Roundtable” radio show with John Catsimatidis. He stressed that “the notion that somehow gun control would have eliminated [the Orlando attack] is just an absolute disconnect. ” And he explained that this is so because the gunman —  Omar Mateen —  was determined to carry out a heinous act that he had “pledged allegiance to [ISIS] and was probably inspired and converted by the virtue of the internet and some of his travel. ” Ridge had no criticism for those working to keep terrorists away from guns, but he emphasized his conviction that more gun control is not the solution.
