On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “New Day,” Representative André Carson ( ) who has endorsed Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, stated that while there isn’t a “smoking gun” in the   Clinton Foundation documents and emails, “there is always a slippery slope of sorts, when you have donors who give, and then after they give, they make requests from bureaucrats or politicians. ”  Carson said, “Well, I think there is always a slippery slope of sorts, when you have donors who give, and then after they give, they make requests from bureaucrats or politicians. You never want to have the appearance of impropriety, or pay to play, but when you’re dealing with human beings things happen, and we get into this kind of messy area. But I think what is clear, is that, Secretary Clinton, soon to be President Clinton, nothing has been found, to your point. There’s no smoking gun. She will be our next president. And I think it shows over and over again, despite the assertions of others, that she is someone who has great integrity, and she is fit to lead our country. ” He added, “I think sometimes our impulse to either pay back a favor, or to do something for someone can get muddied, and in this era of email exchanges, and it could give an appearance of some sinister plot when there isn’t really one. But I think there are always ethical considerations that we should take into consideration. We make decisions. But at the end of the day, we’re all human beings, and we should all be more mindful about the ways in which we approach things. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
