A new report reveals that President Obama is throwing the weight of the federal government behind a program to secure summer jobs for hundreds of “refugees” brought into the U. S. by the President’s refugee program guided by the United Nations. [The President has unveiled a program he is calling the Summer Opportunity Project, insisting, “Access to a job in the summer and beyond can make all the difference to a young person —  especially those who don’t have access to many resources and opportunities. ”  Obama is providing $21 million in tax dollars for the program to help American youth find work for the summer, but along with finding jobs for Americans, $2 million of the funds are being earmarked for about 400 “refugees” currently situated in New York. According to Syracuse. com, the money will be spent to aid the refugees to gain work experience by offering academic tutoring in English and math, as well as finding them   jobs. Obama has done this before, of course. In 2012, the President’s jobs program helped illegals compete with Americans for scare job opportunities. Further, by 2014 it was discovered that Obamacare offered U. S. firms a $3, 000 incentive to hire illegals over Americans. Last year, it was discovered that Obama was bringing refugees into every state in the country but refusing to tell state governors where he was placing them all. Meanwhile, a recent report found that many of these refugees Obama is bringing into the country are racked with diseases, especially tuberculosis. Obama is not working alone on the refugee program. The United Nations is actually the chief agency helping him bring these refugees into the U. S. under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
