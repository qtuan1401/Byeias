’’ ”The 737 is Boeing’s    product.” ”Over the past five decades, it has become the   airliner of all time with more than 13, 300 jets ordered in the model’s history.” ’But now, industry sources tell  that Boeing may be ready to make significant changes to the 737 in order to fill a gaping hole in its product lineup left by the defunct 757.’ ’The rumored plan would call for a new version of the 737 nicknamed the ”MAX 10,” or the ”Mad MAX. ”’ ’A Boeing representative declined to comment on the existence of the rumored jet.’ ’All of this stems from a decision the company made in 2004.’ ’In that year, Boeing discontinued the     757 after more than 20 years in production.’ ’A decade later, the aging but versatile 757 has now become a highly coveted asset for its operators. Unfortunately, airlines simply have not been able to find a new aircraft capable of delivering the range, performance, and profitability of the 757.’ ”Airbus’ and Boeing’s current offerings  —   the A321neoLR and the 737 MAX 9  —   are widely seen as partial replacements for the 757, but are models adapted from smaller aircraft.” ’Frantz Yvelin, CEO of boutique airline La Compagnie and a Boeing 757 operator, told  earlier this year that he believed Boeing made a ”major mistake” when it put the plane out to pasture.’ ”Boeing’s problems are compounded by the fact that the Airbus A321neo has outsold the 737 MAX 9   .

The 737 has essentially maxed out on the engine size that can fit under its wings. As a result, Boeing will have to raise and relocate the plane’s landing gear.” ’Industry experts believe that the modification will likely cost Boeing up to $2 billion, according to Reuters.’ ’As steep as this price may be for Boeing, it is likely to be much less steep than building a new 757 replacement from scratch.’ ”The 737 is Boeing’s    product. ..”
