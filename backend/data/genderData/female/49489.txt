’  ’ ’   There’’s a ”you’’re doing it wrong” meme that’’s showing some strong   staying power these days: you don’’t need to warm up your car when   it’’s cold  —   in fact, if you do, you could harm your engine. ’ ’   The engineering behind this revision of what many folks have been   told their whole lives is solid, and . ’ ”   Modern cars don’t use carburetors to blend the   mixture.   They use electronic fuel injection, so a   warmup isn’t   mechanically necessary. ” ”   But here’s the thing: If you can’t run your modern car for ten   minutes or so when it’s cold, you should be asking some serious   questions about the allegedly advanced state of automaking in the   21st century. It’s possible that the   warmup would   marginally degrade your engine oil, but in 35 years of driving,   I’ve never heard of or experienced this. ” ”   Bottom line: Your car should be able to handle some serious   extremes of temperature, as long as you aren’t spending a lot of   time in Death Valley or the Arctic Circle. ” ’’ ”   Here’s why I often warm my car up when it’s cold  —   in fact, why I   have been avidly warming up my car since it began to get a bit   frosty in the Northeast  : ” ”   The first four are about comfort; the last one is about safety.   Plus, I think a warm and comfortable driver is a much safer   driver than one who’s hunched and shivering and has to wear   gloves. ” ”   Additionally, you won’t waste all that much gas with a   at   idle. You’d have to run the engine for an hour to burn a gallon. ” ”   So go ahead, warm up your car! It’s getting colder in much of the   US. Warm away! ”
