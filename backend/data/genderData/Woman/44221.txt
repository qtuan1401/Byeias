’  ’ ”   On a cold morning in February 2015, a group of men left the   spacious Google X headquarters in Mountain View, California,   before daybreak. They traveled more than two hours east to some   trailers parked in the middle of nowhere, on private ranch lands   in California’s Central Valley. ” ’   The men were there to test experimental drones for Google’s   celebrated    group, known as Google X (the   group now calls itself simply ”X”). The work was grueling and   involved   to   days of physically demanding labor in the   extreme temperatures of the Central Valley, outside the town of   Merced. ’ ’   The men had complained to their supervisors about the hours in   these conditions, but they felt their requests were largely   ignored. ’ ’   And on this day, their complaints turned into terror. One of   their team members, a man in his   collapsed on the job.   He fell to the ground and jerked violently, as if he was   crawling. ’ ’   The incident was caught on the field video. Miles from anywhere,   his coworkers called an ambulance and drove as fast as they could   to meet it en route. He was taken to a local hospital and held   overnight. ’ ’   Some people at Google X say he had a heart attack. Others say it   was a grand mal seizure. Word of the incident spread throughout   the company, with rumors swirling that it had been caused by   exhaustion and stress, multiple sources told Business Insider. ’ ”   While the man’s health recovered, his job at Google did not.   After taking a couple of months’ leave, he requested a transfer   to a less physically demanding role within the team or elsewhere   at Google X. Instead, he was sent back out into the field,   essentially demoted, sources say, and eventually pushed out of   the company. ” ’   We have changed the name of the person who experienced this   medical emergency to ”Joe,” because he declined to give us a   statement and requested that Business Insider not publish his   name. But half a dozen people familiar with this incident shared   details, including photos and emails, with Business Insider. ’ ’  ’ ’   Some members of the Project Wing field team painted an alarming   picture of hostile work conditions driven by engineers and   managers back at headquarters who scheduled the group to conduct   loads of tests, thereby producing loads of data, despite the long   hours outdoors that such a schedule required. ’ ’   What’s more, the field crew found much of their feedback and   expertise on how to improve their circumstances discounted or   ignored, in part, some say, because their backgrounds in the   military were allegedly viewed disdainfully by others on their   team. ’ ’   ”It was unconscionable” to make that team ”work that hard,” one   person told us about this team’’s experiences. ’ ”   The story of the drone crew reveals some of the problems that   have plagued Google’s efforts to build advanced delivery drones,   and it illustrates one of the risks when Silicon Valley’s worship   of workaholism and data crash into real people doing physically   demanding jobs. It’s a dangerous dynamic as companies like   Google, Facebook, and   startups expand into new   industries, from aerospace and delivery to space exploration and     cars. ” ’   It also comes at a time when the work conditions and cultures   across America’s tech companies are under scrutiny, in the   . ’ ’   ”It’’s just not right in Silicon Valley,” one person told us. ’ ’   The Valley is grappling with its reputation for being a ”bro”   culture dominated by entitled, young men with degrees from   prestigious universities. It’s a mentality that can result in   exclusion and the victimization of a broad swath of people, from   women and minorities to older men and even veterans. ’ ’   ”This was super wrong. Those folks were harassed in an incorrect   manner,” one person said of the Project Wing flight testers.   ”Those people, the   military folks, their team discriminated   against them very bluntly. ” ’ ”   For about five months, Joe had been a flight test engineer for   Project Wing. The Wing team was developing a delivery drone,   racing against Amazon and drone makers like DJI to invent what   could become a massive new market, delivering everything from   food to medicine to consumers’ doorsteps. ” ’  ’ ’   The team had some successful and highly publicized tests in   Australia the year before, and got the attention of Google   cofounder Sergey Brin. ’ ’   Brin even ”moved a desk into the bull pen of Project Wing where   everyone works,” one person said. Google X was his brainchild and   he often kept tabs on its projects. ’ ”   But things weren’t going so well. ” ’   The Project Wing drone was based on a   design that   took off and landed upright, like a helicopter. But the drone   kept toppling over on its nose. ’ ”   To solve the design problems, the   crew’s   supervisor, Tony Nannini, wanted to do what Google managers often   do in such situations: Collect loads of data. ” ’   Nannini  —   who worked in the corporate offices in Mountain View,   California, not in the field  —   crafted a schedule for ”thousands   of tests,” one person told us. For Joe and the rest of the     crew, that meant   to   days outdoors flying   the drones, sometimes in freezing temperatures or while standing   in fields of    mud and cow excrement or, at other   times, dealing with the Central Valley’’s infamous      heat. ’ ’   While Joe was the only person we know of to be hospitalized,   other people also complained of exhaustion and of difficulty   working in the harsh conditions, particularly the heat, according   to documents viewed by Business Insider. Although the worksite   included an   trailer for the crew, the work of   flying drones required spending long periods outside, sources   said. ’ ”   The crew also complained that the work schedule was so demanding,   with days spent away from home, it left them little time or   energy for a home life. And while they were able to take   advantage of some of Google’s perks (one person mentioned   Google’s free     laundry service) they were unable   to enjoy most of the benefits their coworkers had, such as social   gatherings, lectures, and the like. ” ’   Several people we spoke with said that Joe and the     crew at Project Wing seemed to be treated poorly in part because   they were labeled  . Joe was not actually a veteran but   had worked as a civilian for the military, people told us. The   team included several other retired and former military folks. ’ ’  ’ ’   There were conflicts between the   crew and their   immediate supervisor, Nannini, as well as the head of the project   at the time, Dave Vos, according to emails shared with Business   Insider. ’ ”   From the testers’ point of view, they had loads of experience   with sophisticated aircraft. They wanted clear rules, better   safety protocols, and reasonable work expectations from the   Project Wing managers. At the same time, some members of the     crew felt like their expertise on how to   accomplish their mission was being dismissed, people told us. ” ”   In contrast, some of the team’s managers felt as if the crew’s   skills with combat airplanes and military drones made them   somewhat overqualified and their ideas overkill for the task at   hand, according to a person close to the company. ” ’   It was a disconnect between two groups with very different   mentalities about how to get things done. ’ ’   Tension arose. A project manager from headquarters allegedly made   a disparaging comment to the crew about military people and their   ability to think independently. The crew members accused Nannini   of condoning such attitudes. ’ ’   Team members complained about the alleged antimilitary attitude   to a top manager and then, later, to the Google X     representative, Chelsea Bailey. Emails reviewed by Business   Insider, sent by two separate team members to Google HR, cite a   perception of bias against veterans. ’ ’   Others went to HR over everything from project management to the   hours required, to safety and general working conditions,   according to emails seen by Business Insider. ’ ’   When Google X conducted its annual   survey,   internally called ”Alphageist,” the   team gave Nannini   very low ratings. He gave them low   ratings,   too, multiple people told us. ’ ”   The low   ratings meant that they wouldn’t   qualify to be transferred to other jobs within Google, we   understand. This was particularly hard on Joe, people said. ” ’   ”They were asking him to work   hour weeks outside in the   middle of California in 110 degrees. He had a heart attack and   then they let him go on temporary medical leave,” one person said   regarding Joe. ”Then his manager, the key source of a lot of   those   allegations, just completely downplayed him   and constantly took retribution on him.” ’ ’   Nannini did not respond to our request for comment. ’ ’   But Google X spokeswoman Courtney Hohne defended Nanini’’s   management tactics, saying, ”Just because a manager doesn’t   accept someone’s idea or recommendation doesn’t mean they’re   dismissive of this person’s professional skills or background.   Ultimately a manager’s job, particularly when testing   technologies that are unlike those that have come before, is to   sift through a variety of possibilities and chart the most   promising path. ’ ’   ”Like other good people managers at X, Tony has worked hard to   build a team of people with diverse backgrounds and   perspectives,” Hohne said. ’ ’   Some people blamed Bailey, saying, ”That HR person was so   inadequate in handling the case. Her job is to protect management   the whole time.” ’ ’   Hohne denied that, saying that Google X has a separate     team that operates completely   independently, and that the company has confidential hotlines and   advisory groups for employees to turn to. ’ ’  ’ ’   The one person no one blamed was Brin, the Google cofounder back   at X headquarters. ’ ’   While everyone on the Wing team chatted with Brin (and described   him as a ”nice guy” filled with ideas on how to solve technical   challenges) they didn’’t lodge their complaints to him,   considering him to be too far above their boss’’s head to go to   for such matters. ’ ’   ”He wasn’t involved in    and maybe he couldn’t see the   angst on everybody’s faces,” one person told us about Brin. ”He   was there so much, I don’t know how he couldn’t have heard, but   he could be so above it all, it never floated to his attention.” ’ ’   Hohne also denied that work conditions for Project Wing field   people were harsh and said that employees were ”empowered” to   take breaks. ’ ’   ”The Wing site has an   trailer with plenty of   snacks and drinks, so our team can get the rest and shade they   need. We also monitor working hours and conditions, and we adjust   our testing schedules accordingly,” Hohne said. ’ ’   ”Given that our moonshots take   years to come into the world,   we set up our teams to think of their work as marathons rather   than sprints, and encourage them to pace themselves and take   breaks to step back, reassess, and make improvements and   adjustments. We empower our field teams to exercise their   judgment about what’s best to do when they encounter challenging   working conditions and locations.” ’ ”   After he collapsed, Joe took a couple of months of     disability leave and then got the doctor’s OK to return to work.   He asked to be transferred to another, less physical team on   Project Wing or within Google X. ” ’   He was an electrical engineer, in addition to being a pilot,   drone pilot, and   engineer, with decades of   experience, sources said. But he was told no other positions were   available for him, people told us. ’ ’   Instead, Joe was demoted from   engineer to a ”ground   operator” job with the field crew. Because of the medical   incident, his pilot’’s license was in question, so he was no   longer allowed to fly drones. This job still involved long   workdays outdoors helping to lug gear and otherwise conduct   tests. ’ ’  ’ ”   While he worked that job, he tried to transfer to other jobs   within Google. But then he was given a poor performance review.   Again, that’s the kiss of death for transfer requests at Google.   Only highly rated employees can move to other jobs, sources say. ” ’   In December, after working as a ground operator for months, he   was written up on a ”performance plan,” the final step before   firing someone at Google, sources tell us. ’ ’   Ultimately, Joe was given a choice: Accept being laid off, with   severance, and sign the standard papers waiving his right to sue,   or be fired with a long paper trail showing     assessments, sources told us. ’ ’   ”They laid him off saying he was not a team player. He almost   gave his life for the company, but he’’s not a team player?” one   person told us. ’ ’   The worst part is that, with his pilot’s license in jeopardy   (perhaps permanently) Joe may not be able to fly aircraft again,   which limits his abilities to get other jobs in his field. ’ ”   To understand why Joe and the rest of this crew didn’t just up   and quit, it’s necessary to go back to 2014 when a bunch of   people from Facebook wearing hoodies and tennis shoes flew   private jets to New Mexico and made an offer to buy a startup   called Titan Aerospace. ” ’  ’ ’   Titan Aerospace was creating   drones that could stay   aloft for years at a time and beam internet access down to earth.   It fit in with Facebook’s Internet. org project. ’ ’   Facebook  to buy Titan. But Google,   which had similar ambitions, swooped in and outbid Facebook,   acquiring Titan in April 2014. ’ ’   Titan employees were thrilled. Their        startup stock would become Google stock, vesting over four years,   sources told us. All they had to do was continue working at a   company with a reputation as a great place to work. ’ ’   At first Google was all in. It built Titan a . But eight months after employees moved into the   new building, Google started to ”dismantle” Titan, as one person   described it. ’ ’   In August 2015, Google  into Alphabet, transferring its hodgepodge   of ”moonshot” businesses into a category called ”other bets.”   Facing public scrutiny and business objectives for the first   time, several of those ”other bets” had . ’ ’   In October 2015, Google was rethinking Titan too. ’ ’   It decided to move Titan to Mountain View and laid off a bunch of   employees. It gave the remaining Titan staffers generous   relocation assistance to move to California, enough to cover the   cost of things like taking a $60, 000 loss on a fast sale of a   home, people told us. ’ ’  ’ ’   Employees simply had to commit to a standard term: stay at Google   for a year or be obligated to pay back the relocation money. ’ ’   A month after relocating those employees, and despite an   investment we estimate to be upwards of $75 million,  and laid off more Titan   employees. Some found other jobs inside of Google, including the     folks who landed at Project Wing. ’ ’   But when problems arose at Wing, former Titan staffers felt   stuck. ’ ’   It was a   situation. Even so, some of the team working   ”couldn’’t take it anymore” and did quit before their full payout   matured, sources say. ’ ’   Since these troubles last year, there was a coup of sorts within   the Project Wing group, people told us. ’ ’   The   design was eventually scrapped, replaced by a new   design with a fuselage. The new drone  in a special test site   in Virginia in September. ’ ”   The leader of the team, David Vos, who backed Nannini’s testing   schedule and allegedly had his share of   with the     team,  in October, with people confirming to us he   was essentially pushed out. Vos did not respond to a request for   comment. ” ’  ’ ’   When the leader of Google X Astro Teller was asked  he said, ”We   definitely aren’’t going to keep things the way they are for one   second longer when the right thing to do is to make a change,   which it frequently is, because that’’s learning.” ’ ’   Nannini remains at X with Project Wing. Several people told us he   was promoted, but a representative would neither confirm nor deny   that. ’ ’   Each X project is its own dominion and each winds up with its own   culture, one person told us. Project Wing was particularly known   inside Google X for its politics. ’ ’   The experience for veterans in other parts of X, or parent   company Alphabet, may be completely different. Hohne, the Google   X spokeswoman, says that plenty of   people are having   fabulous careers at X, including some in leadership positions,   and she lauded the unique skills, judgment, and field experience   that veterans bring. ’ ’   She also said that today, more than half of the current Project   Wing team has been in the military or spent parts of their   careers in the defense industry, as is common  ’ ’   Hohne declined to comment on the specifics of Joe’’s situation,   citing HR confidentiality, but said that safety and employee     are of the highest priority and that the company   follows all applicable regulations. Google X also employs   ”experts” to help teams mitigate challenging work environments,   and the Project Wing team made changes to the test site after   spending time with one such adviser. ’ ’   If an employee has a medical issue, Google follows the guidance   and restrictions of the medical provider and engages with the   employee to determine if a ”reasonable accommodation” is   necessary, she said. ’ ”   But some say the problem is deeper and that the Wing team’s   experience is symptomatic of a bias that the tech company has yet   to fully come to terms with. ” ’   ”Google makes a very big public effort with employees to try and   eliminate bias,” one person with knowledge of Google X said. But   for ”older” employees and for ”anybody who was in the military,”   at least in Project Wing, ”there’’s a huge unconscious bias,” this   person said. ’ ’   As Silicon Valley takes a hard look in the mirror, it is   increasingly apparent it needs to examine its whole culture. It   needs to make sure its mantra of ”work fast and break things”   applies only to its technology and not to its people. ’ ’On a cold morning in February 2015, a group of. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
