TMZ Sports caught up with former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel this weekend.  The free agent and former first round draft pick was cut last week after a plethora of   issues, but told the TMZ reporter “of course” he would be back next year. Manziel cleared waivers, meaning he can now sign with any team, but his constant partying and domestic issues will likely keep teams from giving him another opportunity. At least until he gets his life in order. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
