The range of content available on the online streaming service Netflix has dropped by a staggering 50% since 2012, according to a report from the streaming blog Exstreamist. [The study reveals that while the service had over 11, 000 titles available in 2012, that number has now dropped to around 5, 300 titles in the US, with the number differing slightly depending on the host country.  Netflix cites the company’s focus on providing exclusive content as the primary reason for the shrinking of their overall content library, as it attempts to fight off fierce competition from services such as Amazon Prime and Hulu. The service has produced hit shows such as House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, and Stranger Things and plans to continue investing in original content as a core part of the company’s strategy. “You should expect us to push toward more   in terms of original exclusive content and licensed content,” said the company’s CFO David Wells recently.    Evidence of this strategy is clear judging by the size of its recent investments, which include $120 million on The Get Down, directed by Baz Luhrmann, and $90 million on Bright, a film starring Will Smith.
