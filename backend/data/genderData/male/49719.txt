’  ’ ’   The Houston Texans benched quarterback Brock Osweiler midway   through the second quarter against the lowly Jacksonville Jaguars   on Sunday after he went    for 48 yards and two   interceptions.  ’ ’   Osweiler, who spurned the Broncos in the offseason to sign a $72   million contract with the Texans, now has 16 interceptions on the   season to go with 14 touchdown passes. His interceptions against   the Jags came on consecutive passes and led directly to ten   points for the Jaguars.  ’ ’   Tom Savage took over with roughly eight minutes left in the half   and the fans went nuts:  ’ ’ ’ ”   Here’s Osweiler’s second interception, a terrible decision to   force a pass deep in his own end of the field:  ” ’ ’ ”   Osweiler has struggled mightily during the bulk of his first   season in Houston. Still, the Texans have managed to take the   lead in the AFC South at  . It’s unclear for now whether   Osweiler will remained bench going forward (and potentially into   the playoffs) or if it’s just because he didn’t have it today. ” ”   Either way, it’s never great when you pay a quarterback $72   million in the offseason, and then have to bench him in Week 15   against a   team because he can’t stop throwing   interceptions.  ” ’   The Texans will pay Osweiler $21 million this season, including   his $12 million signing bonus. His $16 million salary for next   season is fully guaranteed. ’ ’  ’
