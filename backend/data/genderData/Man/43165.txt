’  ’ ’   The suspected Florida airport gunman was charged by federal   prosecutors on Saturday in connection to the mass shooting that   killed five and wounded six the previous day. ’ ’   Esteban Santiago, 26, could face the death penalty or life   imprisonment if he is convicted of the charges, which include   performing an act of violence at an international airport   resulting in bodily harm, as well as firearms violations. ’ ’   Santiago is set to appear in court Monday in Fort   Lauderdale. ’ ’   Federal authorities alleged earlier on Saturday that Santiago   appears to have traveled to the Fort     International Airport specifically to carry out the attack, the    reported. ’ ’   Prosecutors said Santiago pulled out a handgun in the   Terminal 2 baggage claim area and began shooting at the newly   arrived passengers, aiming at their heads until he used up his   ammunition. ’ ’’ ’   The suspect then dropped the gun on the ground after being   confronted by a Broward Sheriff’s Office deputy, and was   arrested, prosecutors said. ’ ’   Investigators said it’s unclear why the Florida airport was   chosen as the target, and they have not ruled out terrorism   as a potential motive. ’ ’   Authorities said Santiago was previously known to the FBI, having   officers at a field office in Alaska in November. He   reportedly told officers the federal government was controlling   his mind and forcing him to watch ISIS videos, according to the   Associated Press. ’ ”   Officers then seized a gun Santiago had left in his car    —   with his newborn child  —    and took him to get a   mental health evaluation. The returned the gun to Santiago on   Dec. 8, but it’s unclear whether it was the same gun used in   Friday’s massacre. ”
