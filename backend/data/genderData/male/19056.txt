Republican Presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson joined Breitbart News daily host Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius XM radio today and was asked about his recent Fox News   “It’s time to declare war on ISIS,” and also to explain his interpretation of “civilizational Jihad” and how it would set the framework for him as    when it came to taking on ISIS. [The following is a brief excerpt from Carson’s   linked above.  Most disturbing of all is the revelation during the Holy Land trial of a strategic document that called on members to conduct a “civilizational jihad” to impose sharia law in the United States. This is not representative of all Muslim Americans, but rather of the terrorist organizations to which some are tied. We must fight this radical Islamic ideology wherever we find it, and by every means at our disposal. We must destroy terrorist movements like ISIS around the world while countering radical Islamic ideology here in the United States. No group can subjugate the U. S. Constitution to their will. Said Carson as regards civilizational Jihad, “during the Holy Land foundation trial in 2006 and 2007 in Texas, one of the documents that was uncovered was an explanatory memorandum and  it talked about what their actual goals were, the Jihadists who disguised themselves as moderate Muslims. And it was to infiltrate, to multiply, to gain positions of power and to commit what they call ‘civilization jihad.’ Basically taking us down from within and replacing our basic   values with Islam. ” Carson added, “They said it would be easier to do in the United States because of our political correctness. We would be so busy trying to protect their rights, that we wouldn’t be watching our own. ” Carson defended against the charge that his views make him “islamophobic,” saying there is a difference between Muslims who accept America and those who don’t.
