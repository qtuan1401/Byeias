’  ’ ’     Look no further than the suburbs to see how American ideals     about success are transforming.   ’ ’     People in the US suburbs are changing the way they shop, where     they eat, and what they want in their homes.   ’ ’     Malls are shutting down as   continues to take over,     and the   chains that fed shoppers after a day of     hoofing it through the mall are struggling to cope.   ’ ’     Business Insider reporters from our consumer, transportation,     news, graphics, video, and innovation teams have explored this     idea in a series of stories.   ’ ”     We’re calling it the Death of Suburbia  —   because if the trends     that they identified continue, the many suburbs as we know them     will be forever changed.   ” ’     Urban and suburban areas are becoming less distinguishable as     modern populations value convenience and location over     size.    ’ ’     The line between city and suburb has already started to blur,     Fadi Masoud, an urban planning professor at the University     of Toronto who contributed to a forthcoming book called     ”Infinite Suburbia” told Business Insider’’s Leanna     Garfield.    ’ ’     ”Some people still attribute the oldest part of the city, which     is predominantly   and more dense as ‘urban,’     and then everything else that starts going out further in     distance from the core as ’’suburban. ’’ But that definition     doesn’t work as well now,” he tells Business Insider. ”What you     would usually define as urban and suburban is eroding.”   ’ ’     Urban planners across America are rethinking how suburbs are     designed. Towns like New Rochelle, a suburb of New York     City, are evolving to focus less on space and possession and     more on walkability and environmental impact.    ’ ’  ’ ’       The   mansions of old are plummeting in       value as homebuyers become more discerning.     ’ ”       In an article from August 2016,  from   site Trulia that       showed that the premiums paid for McMansions have declined       significantly in 85 of the country’s 100 biggest cities.     ” ’       For the purpose of the study, Trulia defined a McMansion as a       home that was built between 2001 and 2007 and that has       between 3, 000 and 5, 000 square feet of space.     ’ ”       To cite one example, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the extra       money that buyers were expected to be willing to pay to own a       McMansion fell by 84% from 2012 to 2016. In that same city in       2012, a typical McMansion would be valued at $477, 000, about       274% more than the area’s other homes. Today, a McMansion       would be valued at $611, 000, or 190% above the rest of the       market.     ” ”       Experts told Business Insider’s Madeline Stone that the       youngest generations of homebuyers tend to value efficiency       more than ever before, and feel McMansions are       impractical and wasteful.      ” ’  ’ ”       As anchor store behemoths like Macy’s, Sears, and JCPenney       close hundreds of locations, the future of malls is in       jeopardy.       ” ”       The commercial real estate firm CoStar estimates that nearly       a quarter of malls in the US, or roughly 310 of the nation’s       1, 300 shopping malls, are at high risk of losing an anchor       store.      ” ’       Once that happens, it spells trouble for communities  —         especially those in the suburbs where job opportunities are       more limited than in cities.      ’ ’       ”Malls are big, big contributors to city and state taxes,       jobs, and everything,” Howard Davidowitz, chairman of       research firm Davidowitz & Associates, told Business       Insider’’s Hayley Peterson. ”Once they close, they are a       blight on the community for a very long time.”     ’ ”       As a transformation in retail continues to shutter giants       Sears and Macy’s and threaten malls across the country, food       court mainstays like Sbarro, Cinnabon,  and Panda Express face an uncertain       future.      ” ’  ’ ’       ”In the past several years, a handful of America’’s largest       corporations have joined a mass exodus from their suburban       headquarters to new home bases in the city, and millennials       seem to be the driving force,” writes Business Insider’’s       Chris Weller.      ’ ’       Beginning in 2015,  and  have all left the leafy suburbs of Chicago       for office spaces downtown.  ’ ’ General Electric announced it was ditching       Fairfield, Connecticut, for Boston. And several years ago,       Swiss banking giant UBS  to New York City after 15 years in Stamford,       Connecticut. The reason? UBS  much of its top talent lived 35 miles south, in       Manhattan.     ’ ’       The roads and bridges that connect America’s suburbs are in       desperation need of repair.      ’ ’       The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gives the US a       D grade for its roads and a C grade for its bridges. The US       Department of Transportation estimates that almost $1       trillion is needed to improve the current Interstate and       highway system in the US.     ’ ’       ”In suburbs, the big challenge is repairing the existing       highway system,” Christopher Leinberger, chair of the center       for Real Estate and Urban Analysis at George Washington       University, told Business Insider. ”Ideally, there won’t be       any new highway capacity built because we can’’t afford to       maintain what we have.”     ’ ’  ’ ”       Playing golf was once a celebrated pastime. But today, many       of the country’s golf courses are on the brink of shutting       down or have closed already.      ” ’       The weakest link in the industry was casual dining, which was       the bottom performer in all but two months of the year. The       vast majority of these restaurants are in the       suburbs.       ’ ’       Ruby Tuesday is in search of a new CEO and in the process of       selling 95 restaurants amidst falling sales. Bloomin’’ Brands,       the parent company of casual dining chains including Outback       Steakhouse and Carrabba’’s Grill, announced plans in       Febuary to close 43 locations after a ”challenging” 2016.       Buffalo Wild Wings  —   where   sales fell 2. 4% in 2016        —   is engaged in a power struggle with activist investor       Marcato Capital.      ’ ’  ’ ”       America’s neighborhoods are changing like never before.     ” ”       In this series, we will explore the cause of this phenomenon       and the major shifts impacting the suburbs. We’ll also show       what things will be like in the future.     ” ”       To kick off the series, check out this exploration of what’s       happening to American malls and this photo essay of deserted       golf courses.
