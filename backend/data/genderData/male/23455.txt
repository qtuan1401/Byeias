According to a CBS Baltimore report, a Baltimore Police lieutenant and police union leader has been suspended following the surfacing of an email he sent to union members that called Black Lives Matter protesters “thugs. ”  The email that surfaced was sent to the entire police force from Lt. Victor Gearhart, who wrote of the protesters, “  …    expect more bad behavior from the thugs of Baltimore. ” Gearhart was suspended from the force after commanding officers discovered the email Monday. “The commissioner was absolutely outraged because it’s something that we’re constantly working on,” police spokesperson T. J. Smith said. Gearhart filed a lawsuit against the police department earlier this year after controversial tweets resulted in a reassignment to overnight security duty. The Baltimore PD has launched an internal investigation over the email.  An excerpt from the email read as follows: “By now you have seen that the THUGS from Black Lives Matter and other similar groups have attempted to disrupt the State FOP Convention being held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. Well today as   day with activities spread over the next 3 days so expect more bad behavior from the Thugs of Baltimore. On the bright side maybe they will stop killing each other while they are protesting us. ” #WJZ obtains controversial letter sent to FOP members from Police Lt @cbsbaltimore pic. twitter.   —   MeghanWJZ (@MeghanWJZ) August 15, 2016,  Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
