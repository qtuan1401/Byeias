 (CNN) For over six years, Vietnamese model and show producer Jessica Minh Anh has been turning the world’s most visited landmarks into her personal runway.  In recent years, she has staged    and starred in      productions at the Eiffel Tower and London’s Tower Bridge, along with the new One World Trade Center building in New York and a glass bridge 4, 000 ft above the Grand Canyon.  Her shows feature the collections of lesser known fashion designers from around the world (recent collaborators include emerging Lebanese brand Rouba. G and Peruvian designer Ani Álvarez Calderón) and involve as many as 50 models and crew members. ”I believe the most exquisite designs should be showcased at the best locations,” she previously told CNN.  ”I constantly search for the most unique venues that will amaze the world.”  Scroll through the gallery at the top to hear what drives Anh’s vision and which location has meant most to her.
