Kevon Smith Sr. walked out to his car after eating breakfast with his son at a Cracker Barrel in Willoughby, Ohio and found a note on his windshield that read, “We need more black dads like you. ”[“I noticed this older couple over in the corner,” Smith said. “They kept smiling at me and I was looking at my son like —   what is going on?”  Attached to the note was cash to pay for the father and his son’s breakfast. “Today your meal is on my wife and me. Enjoy that baby boy as long as God intends. Keep doing what you’re doing. The Masons,” the note said.   Smith, who said he didn’t have a father growing, was overwhelmed with emotion. That complete strangers were so generous and went out of their way to show their appreciation. Smith said fathering his son is his first priority, even though there are many men who unfortunately fall short. “There’s a lot of guys I know that aren’t taking care of their kids,” said Smith. “To show that not all of us are out here being gangbangers, some of us are out here being fathers. ” Smith said he can’t wait to explain to his son what happened, of course when he’s old enough to understand. “I’m definitely going to make sure I’m paying it forward,” Smith said. “I get blessed. I want to bless someone else. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
