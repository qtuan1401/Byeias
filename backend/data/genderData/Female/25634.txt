Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos joined CNBC’s Power Lunch to discuss free speech and his views on NFL player Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem. [“What do you think about Colin Kaepernick?” asked Power Lunch   Tyler Mathisen, after Milo discussed the reasons why Twitter actually banned him.  “Oh god, I’m so bored about hearing about this silly grandstanding,” replied Milo. “You know, those moments where you have the national anthem and everyone comes together despite their political differences, race, gender, whatever, those are the moments when you’re supposed to be respectful of your fellow players, of the audience, of everybody around you, come together for that moment, and say ‘okay, these are the things we believe in, let’s go and do this guys. ’” “But that seems to run against you,” said Mathisen, as CNBC Chief International Correspondent, Michelle Caruso Cabrera agreed. “Doesn’t that run against your thought that we should be less respectful?” “Oh no, I think we should be hugely respectful of free speech and freedom of expression” Milo disagreed. “No, I don’t want to get too uptight about it because I don’t care about some sportsman, as I started out to say. I don’t care about some sportsman having a little hissy fit spectacle, okay? What I would like though is when our sportsmen and celebrities do things like this and all eyes are on them afterwards, I would like them to actually say something of substance. Have a real argument, rather than these lefty talking points, and by the way, the reason sales of his shirt are going up is because people are burning them. ” Upon being asked by Cabrera whether he still believes in Kaepernick’s right to disrespect the national anthem, Milo replied, “Of course, I just think he’s an idiot. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
