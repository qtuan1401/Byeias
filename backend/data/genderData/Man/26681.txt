Rep. Luis Gutiérrez ( ) predicts that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the Obama administration’s executive amnesty programs. [“We expected the Supreme Court to take up the case and we expect the President’s point of view will prevail. The law, the legal precedent, and the people are on the President’s side,” Gutiérrez said in a statement.  The most vocal amnesty advocate in Congress reacted Tuesday to the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the government’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling preventing the implementation of President Obama’s plan to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation and grant them work permits. Gutiérrez charges that Obama’s opponents have been trying to “run out the clock” until Obama leaves office. “We are not going to deport our way to law and order in immigration, nor build a big wall around America,” he said. According to the Illinois lawmaker, Congress is the body that should be in the   business but, due to congressional inaction, Obama’s unilateral amnesty is a “coping mechanism. ” “What we need is a legal immigration system that works so that we do not have a large number of immigrants vulnerable to deportation, leaving them and their families and businesses to cope with the dysfunctional reality,” Gutiérrez said. “The President’s actions are not a substitute for Congressional action they are a coping mechanism for Congressional inaction. ” While Democrats like Gutiérrez have cheered the administration’s executive amnesty, Republicans argue it is unconstitutional, expanding the authority of the executive beyond reasonable limits. The high court is expected to make a final ruling on the legality of the programs later this year.
