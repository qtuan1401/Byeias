Troy Newman, a board member of the Center for Medical Progress, reports that officials from the California Attorney General’s office are searching the apartment of David Daleiden. [Daleiden is the   activist who produced the raft of videos exposing the Planned Parenthood baby parts trade that has roiled the abortion giant since last summer.  The film maker has been sued by Planned Parenthood. He was also indicted in Houston on various charges related to his expose of the Texas abortion clinic. According to Newman, the search being carried out now in Daleiden’s California apartment came at the direction of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, a longtime financial supporter of Planned Parenthood. Harris, who comes from the San Francisco area, is considered a bright star in the Democrat firmament, sometimes spoken of as a potential vice presidential candidate in the current cycle. It is not known at this time what officials from her office are looking for. And as yet there has been no statement from Daleiden or his representatives.
