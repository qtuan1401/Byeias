Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough excoriated Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton for her continued denial of wrongdoing pertaining to her use of a private email server and her reaction to the investigator general’s report saying otherwise.

Does she not have anybody around her that can tell her that we have to stop lying about this because everything she said in there was just a lie. I mean, it was allowed by the State Department. No, it was not allowed by the State Department. Everybody knew in the State Department we were doing it. No. They said we didn’t know, but if we did know we wouldn’t allow her to do it.
