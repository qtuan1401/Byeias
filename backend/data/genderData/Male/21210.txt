GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee blasted the White House’s newest executive actions that aim to restrict firearms. [“In America we believe in the   confiscations, dictatorships or kings, and Obama’s newest assault on the Second Amendment is a blatant, belligerent abuse of power,” Huckabee charged in a statement on Tuesday.  I will never apologize for my firearms, my ammunition or my concealed carry license. I will never apologize for defending your right to have the same. I will never apologize for protecting myself, my family or my friends. I will never apologize for supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I will never bow down and surrender to Obama’s unconstitutional, radical,   agenda. Washington is    and it’s time for a president that puts Americans first. President Obama is issuing unilateral actions expanding background checks, among other gun control moves.
