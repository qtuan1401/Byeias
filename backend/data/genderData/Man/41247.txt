 (CNN) A rambunctious    managed to trigger a White House lockdown Sunday. Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN that a ”   child climbed under (a) temporary bike rack along Pennsylvania Avenue. Child was fine and was safely reunited with parents.” But the child’s seemingly simple exploration was enough to prompt the Secret Service to close off the presidential residence for a few moments. It was the second lockdown in Washington in as many days. A man committed suicide at the Capitol on Saturday, sparking a lockdown and ”shelter in place” order there.
