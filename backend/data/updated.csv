1,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-mueller-properly-appointed-orders-stone-aide/story?id=61327058,The appeal was launched on behalf of Andrew Miller a former associate of Stone A federal appeals court rejected the most direct constitutional challenge to special counsel Robert Muellers authority on Tuesday telling a former associate of Roger Stone he must testify before Mueller because the special counsel was properly appointed to his role overseeing the independent investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election The appeal was launched on behalf of Andrew Miller a former associate of Stone a political provocateur and steered by the National Legal and Policy Center a wellfunded conservative legal group with a deep history of mounting legal challenges against leftleaning organizations and Democratic politicians Miller is fighting a special counsel subpoena compelling him to appear before Muellers federal grand jury which has  been met with heavy legal resistance In late June Miller turned over requested documents to prosecutors but he was also subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury in the Russia probe The three judge panel found that Mueller was properly appointed in the spring of 2017 by the thendeputy attorney general of the United States Rod Rosenstein after  the attorney general at the time Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation Because the Special Counsel is an inferior officer and the Deputy Attorney General became the head of the Department by virtue of becoming the Acting Attorney General as a result of a vacancy created by the disability of the Attorney General through recusal on the matter we hold that Millers challenge to the appointment of the Special Counsel fails Accordingly we affirm the order finding Miller in civil contempt DC Circuit Court Judges Karen Henderson Sri Srinivasan and Judith Rogers wrote in an opinion Tuesday In upholding the contempt order the threejudge panel ordered Miller to testify before Muellers grand jury After oral arguments last November Millers attorney Paul Kamenar told ABC News Even if we lose this appeals case we will certainly bring it to the Supreme Court Kamenars challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe is based on a claim that Muellers appointment was not handled properly He argues Mueller has been effectively operating as a US Attorney at large and as such should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate  neither of which occurred In a statement to ABC News following the judges decision to uphold the contempt order against Miller Kamenar wrote We are disappointed with the decision and will be considering future legal action whether before the full court of appeals or the Supreme Court Kamenar added The fact that the court took over three months to decide this appeal after oral argument compared to the three days it took in December to decide another challenge to a Mueller subpoena issued to an unnamed foreign corporation demonstrates that this was a serious and substantial challenge Reached by ABC News on Tuesday special counsel spokesperson Peter Carr declined to comment Miller 34 paints houses for a living now but served as an aide to Stone until 2013 Stone who was a longtime informal political adviser to President Donald Trump once described Miller as his wingman because he helped manage Stones schedule travel and media appearances and also provided some IT work Miller identifies himself as a libertarian and has said he did not support Trumps candidacy but he did accompany Stone to the 2016 Republican National Convention On Jan 25th Stone was arrested in a predawn FBI raid at his home in Florida and charged with a sevencount indictment in Muellers probe On Feb 1 he pleaded not guilty to the charges  247 coverage of breaking news and live events,0

rid of the Electoral College US Senator Elizabeth Warren who is competing for the Democratic nomination for president said this week that she supports getting rid of the electoral college and having the presidency decided by a national popular vote She was quickly attacked by many who think this is a radical idea Let us pause for a moment and examine that hypothesis First in polling over the last few years a large majority of voters support deciding the presidency by popular vote as opposed to the Electoral College Support for the popular vote has risen as Americans have witnessed in the last 20 years two presidents win the Oval Office while losing the national popular vote The difference in 2016 was greatest  Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million but lost the Electoral College to Donald Trump Second the argument that the Electoral College ensures that candidates travel to smaller states as well as large ones isnt true and is no longer happening In the 2020 elections campaigns and candidates from both major parties are expected to concentrate nearly all their time and efforts in only 5 or 6 states which represent less than 20 percent of people who will vote for president Therefore 44 or 45 states large and small will be virtually ignored in the process as it is now If the 2020 election were to be decided by a national popular vote instead of the Electoral College candidates and campaigns in the general election would have to completely refashion their strategies In all likelihood they would have to run a national campaign with national advertising buys where all Americans would be involved in the debate over who the next president should be To reallocate resources the campaigns would have to put time and effort into at least 40 states representing 90 percent of the countrys voters In a national popular vote effort campaigns would have to spend time in places like Texas California New York Louisiana Washington Missouri Illinois Kentucky Massachusetts George North Carolina etc Under the current system candidates only go to those states to fundraise A popular vote effort would have to appeal to voters in urban suburban exurban and rural communities of America And campaigns would have to concentrate on both turning out their bases as well as persuading swing voters If you are someone who is an independent and wants choices in the presidential race other than Democrat or Republican ending the Electoral College removes a major impediment for an independent presidential candidacy It is much easier for an independent to win the popular vote than it is for that candidate to win the Electoral College Third while passing a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College is highly unlikely  the bar of threefourths of states passing an amendment in this polarized environment is almost impossible  there are constitutional ways to make the presidential election more representative of the nation as a whole involving more voters from more areas Already a number of states have signed on to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact in which a states electoral votes would be assigned to whoever won the national popular vote  Though they are not yet at the required number of states necessary to total 270 electoral votes there is a path to get their politically in the years ahead Another way to make the popular vote matter while retaining the Electoral College is to adopt the Maine and Nebraska model Those states assign electoral votes by a combination of two statewide and one for each congressional district in their states A presidential candidate wins one electoral vote for every house district they win  This would need to be combined with efforts to fix gerrymandering and expanding their number of members in the US House of Representatives Today each House member represents on average about 750000 people which has become both unwieldy and less responsive to constituents Keep in mind in 1789 after the first apportionment 105 House members each represented roughly 37000 people according to the Pew Research Center The number of representatives has increased after nearly every census apportionment until it reached 435 members in 1913 when the average district size was at approximately 200000 people A law was passed in 1911 limiting the size of the House to 435 members and it has remained for more than 100 years Our founders foresaw a rise in House members as America grew in population and Congress could pass a law to expand the House to a more representative number So while abolishing the Electoral College as Warren suggests may be near impossible her statement that a president should be elected by national popular vote is not radical it is actually mainstream We can get closer to the national popular vote having greater weight in presidential elections and having a president represent all Americans in ways that dont require amending the Constitution These fixes will make presidential candidates run more diverse campaigns and campaign in all cities and communities of our country That will help unify us more as a country and would likely lead to more informed public policy How can anyone be against that outcome 247 coverage of breaking news and live events,-1

power in Venezuela  President Donald Trump and the Trump of the Tropics Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro met face to face at the White House on Tuesday Bolsonaro  a nationalist Twitterloving fakenews decrying politician  chose to make the first bilateral trip of his presidency to Washington where he has found an important friend and ally in Trump As part of a threeday visit in Washington Bolsonaro held a press conference with Trump as he aims to strengthen economic ties and positioning with the US as Brazil seeks an allied front in the Western Hemisphere In a statement ahead of the visit White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the two leaders will discuss opportunities for defense cooperation progrowth trade policies combating transnational crime and restoring democracy in Venezuela A senior administration official who requested anonymity told reporters Bolsonaros visit represented a real opportunity to fundamentally remake our relationship with Brazil The USBrazil relationship has always been one of potential but yet that potential has not always been met the senior administration official said This time it is different This is a historic remaking of the USBrazil relationship where there is truly going to be a NorthSouth axis of the two largest economies in the Western Hemisphere and a true partnership of the largest economies At the start of their White House meetings the president said he is considering NATO membership or some kind of similar alliance for Brazil We are looking at it very strongly We are very inclined to do that The relationship that we have right now with Brazil has never been better I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents There is zero hostility with me Trump said  And we are going to look at that very strongly in terms of whether it is NATO or something having to do with alliance In the Rose Garden press conference the two leaders said they were able to discuss their goals in Venezuela Trump threatened tougher sanctions on Venezuela and said all options are on the table Maduro would not divulge any new strategies in the region but said establishing a true democracy in the country was a shared priority The leaders on Tuesday also discussed a Brazilian offer to grant the United States access to a rocket launch site the removal of a Visa requirement for Americans traveling to Brazil and trade If Bolsonaros goal was to strengthen the relationship between Brazil and the United States it appeared he was successful at least in gaining the friendship of Trump who gave him a warm welcome in the Rose Garden Bolsonaro even got a chuckle out of the president for saying he believed he would get reelected Well its an internal affair We will respect whatever the ballots tell us on 2020 but I do believe Donald Trump is going to be reelected fully Bolsonaro said when asked about the 2020 elections Thank you I agree Trump said with a smile Trump said he liked to hear Bolsonaro use the term fake news In his opening statement Bolsonaro said that Brazil and the United States stand side by side in their efforts to ensure liberties in respect to traditional family lifestyles respect to god our creator politically correct attitudes and against fake news Trump said he was proud to hear his new Brazilian buddy use the same term Bolsonaro who was accompanied on his trip to the United States by his son lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro visited CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia on Monday and addressed the US Chamber of Commerce Brazil is the secondlargest economy in the Western Hemisphere and the United States is Brazils secondlargest trading partner after China For the first time in a while a proAmerica Brazilian president arrives in DC Bolsonaro tweeted upon arriving in Washington Its the beginning of a partnership focused on liberty and prosperity something that all of us Brazilians have long wished for Like Trump Bolsonaro is a rightwing populist with a penchant for rocking the status quo and using Twitter to blast his message around the globe Bolsonaro has been accused of making racist and homophobic remarks and recently has come under fire for a sexually explicit tweet during Brazils Carnival festival Trump was one of the first world leaders to call and congratulate Bolsonaro after this landslide victory in October Similar to Trumps election Bolsonaros win stunned the world and was part a wave of nationalist rightwing leaders elected in Latin America His election he broke all of the historic taboos of winning an election in Latin America He was unabashedly particularly in Brazil pro America a senior administration official said of Bolsonaro He ran on a campaign that he wanted to be the best friend of the United States that he wanted to have this close relationship with President Trump and what that would mean for Brazil for the region for the world I think that was very important The official said the president took note of Bolsonaros Trumplike rhetoric and social media presence and called Bolsonaro to congratulate him within hours of his election US officials hope the visit will not only boost their economic relationship but align efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Venezuela Brazil shares a border with Venezuela and like the United States has joined with dozens of other world leaders in pressuring socialist Nicholas Maduro to turn over power to opposition leader Juan Guaido But while Trump has said every option is on the table in Venezuela suggesting the use of military force Brazil has pushed for diplomatic talks to lead to a change in power A senior administration official said Brazil plays an important role as an interlocutor between the US and Venezuela Brazil has allowed the United States to preposition humanitarian aid for Venezuela on Brazils northern border and we are very grateful to that and we thank him for working tirelessly to provide aide to the Brazilian people and them opening their doors the official said Theres also an opportunity here where they can be very good interlocutors The Brazilian Military has very good relationships with the Venezuelan military and clearly communicate with them as to what should be the role with the Venezuelan military in regards to civility and not repressing and not maintaining the usurpation of democracy Maduro seeks The US and Brazil hope to end the meetings with signed agreements including an agreement that would allow the US to launch satellites and rockets into space from Brazil You will see  after the visit tomorrow we will plan to announce a joint statement that will have a lot of deliverables some which are currently frankly right now being signed and being finalized and being negotiated And thats all extraordinarily positive an official said Monday We think that we have really a historic opportunity to reframe hemispheric relations with this NorthSouth axis 247 coverage of breaking news and live

President Donald Trump continues his feud with Rep Ilhan Omar liberals are criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of not defending the freshman Muslim congresswoman quickly or strongly enough In an interview with local television station KSTP during a trip to Minnesota on Monday Trump was asked if he had any regrets about his Friday tweet accusing Omar of downplaying the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks No not at all Trump said Look shes been very disrespectful to this country Shes been very disrespectful frankly to Israel She is somebody that doesnt really understand I think life real life what its all about Its unfortunate Shes got a way about her thats very very bad I think for our country I think shes extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country On Tuesday Pelosi on a congressional trip to London was asked during an interview with CNN if she agrees with her critics that she did not defend Omar swiftly enough Well I havent had a chance to speak with her Im traveling Pelosi told CNNs Christiane Amanpour She added I dont even know what was said but do I know what the president did was not right On Friday the president tweeted a video that used footage of 911 with comments Omar made at the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations The 43second video captures Omar saying some people did something in reference to terrorists who killed thousands when they crashed planes into the World Trade Center the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania The video which features dramatic music and video of the chaos in downtown Manhattan asks Some people did something But it does not show the entirety of Omars comments For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a secondclass citizen and frankly Im tired of it and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it Omar said at CAIR in California last March CAIR was founded after 911 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties Omar went on to say that the 911 attacks changed how Muslims are viewed in America and encouraged Muslims to not tolerate being treated as secondclass citizens Republicans have criticized the seemingly passive reference to the terrorists who carried out the attacks while Omars defenders have countered that the remarks were largely taken out of context and have been seized on in order to stoke antiIslamic sentiment against the Muslim congresswoman Pelosi condemned Trump for the video but she did not initially mention Omar who was the target of Trumps video by name Since the Presidents tweet Friday evening I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my lifemany directly referencing or replying to the Presidents video Omar said in a statement Sunday evening I thank the Capitol Police the FBI the House Sergeant at Arms and the Speaker of the House for their attention to these threats Pelosi confirmed Sunday that she personally spoke with the House SergeantatArms in order to ensure the safety of Omar as well as her family and staff The Presidents words weigh a ton and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger Pelosi said President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video Fellow Democratic freshman Alexandria OcasioCortez of New York called on Democrats to respond to Trumps tweet and cautioned that if they were to remain silent they would be complicit in Trumps attacks Members of Congress have a duty to respond to the Presidents explicit attack todayIlhanMNs life is in danger For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright dangerous targeting of a member of Congress OcasioCortez wrote Has Nancy Pelosi ever visited a mosque in this country said Waleed Shahid spokesman for the liberal group Justice Democrats in a tweet Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill forcefully denied Shahids suggestion in an emailed response to ABC News saying  the Speaker has been to many mosques in this country and throughout the world This one group attacking the Speaker believes its more important to raise money for their own organization than condemn the Presidents disgusting and vile attacks on Democrats Hammill said of the Justice Democrats group On the presidents attacks against Omar Hammill said The President is making these attacks because of the imminent release of the Mueller report in a desperate attempt to change the subject Rep Rashida Tlaib DMich who is also Muslim expressed frustration over how Democratic leadership was handling Trumps attacks against Omar They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse Tlaib tweeted over the weekend slamming top Democrats for failing to defend Omar from Trumps Islamophobic attacks while also insinuating their diversity is a prop for the Democratic Party However when we ask to be at the table or speak up about issues that impact who we are what we fight for  why we ran in the first place we are ignored she continued retweeting a California state legislative aide who criticized the attacks on IlhanMN and subsequent lack of support from Democratic leadership Just hours after Omar released a statement reporting a surge of threats against her life following a tweeted attack from Trump Trump again took aim at Omar on Monday by describing her as Pelosis leader Before Nancy who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done decides to defend her leader Rep Omar she should look at the antiSemitic antiIsrael and ungrateful US HATE statements Omar has made Trump tweeted She is out of control except for her control of Nancy Pelosi is also taking heat for remarks she made Monday at the London School of Economics in which she seemingly downplayed her and OcasioCortezs stunning midterm election victories When we won this election it wasnt in districts like mine or Alexandrias And shes a wonderful member of Congress I think all of our colleagues will attest the California Democrat said But those are districts that are solidly Democratic This glass of water would win with a D next to its name in those districts she said as she hoisted a glass of water OcasioCortez Tlaib and Omar all

returns both as a candidate and as president Here are some of the notable takeaways from the new financial data of Sens Bernie Sanders of Vermont Kamala Harris of California Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts Kirsten Gillibrand of New York Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota Washington Gov Jay Inslee and former Texas Rep Beto ORourke One of the most apparent takeaways from a candidates tax documents is how much theyre making each year All the candidates reported making more than 200000 filed jointly with their spouses in adjusted gross income in 2018 putting them substantially above an average Americans earnings ranging from Harris 19 million and Warren 846394 to Inslee 202912 Of the seven 2020 candidates to release returns at least three are millionaires Sanders Warren and Harris Sanders famous for his campaign against the unjust power of the richest 1 reported an adjusted gross income of 106 million in 2016 and 113 million in 2017 The bump in income those years was more than four times his income from a year earlier because of his bestselling 2016 book Our Revolution The senator who joked before the release of his returns that if someone else wrote a bestselling book they too could be a millionaire later said he was grateful for the financial success and that it marked a sharp contrast to his upbringing in a paychecktopaycheck household Warren whos also made anticorruption a key focus of her campaign is also part of the 1 the documents show Her adjusted gross income in 2018 after filing jointly with her husband exceeded 846000 Between 2013 and 2015 her adjusted gross income was over 1 million and neared 155 million in 2014 after her first book was released Harris reported the highest 2018 gross income at 189 million Her husband an attorney whom she married in 2014 earned most of their income For 2018 Harris reported just over 157000 in Senate salary and 320125 in profits from the book she authored ahead of her campaign announcement Gillibrand reported 214083 in adjusted gross income for 2018 and Klobuchar reported 338121 ORourke has yet to submit his 2018 returns but reported 366455 for 2017 The most generous candidate in 2018 according to candidates tax returns was Warren She and her husband gave 50128 to charity almost 6 of her household adjusted gross income for the year Next up was Inslee who donated about 4 of his and his wifes income or about 8300 In comparison to other Americans with similar adjusted gross incomes Warren donated about twice the average percentage  which is about 27 for an income between 500000 and 1 million the latest IRS figures show Inslee who reported earning nearly 203000 in 2018 donated about one and a half times more than the average percentage for someone of the same income Sanders and his wife gave about 33 of their income to charity over the past two years They gave 18950 in 2018 and 36300 in 2017 The couple also donated the proceeds of one of the senators books The Speech though the donations did not appear on their tax returns according to the campaign The donations have gone primarily to senior centers lowincome organizations educational entities and environmental and housing advocacy groups the campaign said Sanders donated about the same as the average for similar income according to IRS figures Klobuchar and Gillibrand donated about 2 of their adjusted gross income in 2018 coming to nearly 6600 for Klobuchar and 3750 for Gillibrand Klobuchar and Gillibrands donations also match up with the average percentage that people at those income levels donate IRS figures show ORourke appeared to give the smallest percentage of his familys income to charity in 2017  a total of 1166 or 03 which falls below the average percent donated by someone of his income level while Harris and her husband donated 27000 about 14  less than half of what the average is for similar adjusted gross incomes according to IRS data On average those who earn between 15 million and 2 million donate around 34 of their income to charity the latest IRS figures show Roughly half of all charitable donations come from households with annual incomes of at least 100000 IRS figures show but the percentage doesnt usually skyrocket as wealth increases For example while the average donation for an income bracket between 500000 and 1 million is 2 the average donation for those who earn at least 1020 times more money 10 million a year or more is around 104 The thing thats really shocking is as incomes go up peoples propensity to give doesnt grow proportionally said Len Burman a cofounder of the Tax Policy Project Burman tracked the donations by candidates in the 2012 election and found some like former President Barack Obama and candidate Mitt Romney gave around 14 of their income to charity while candidates like Newt Gingrich gave around 26 If youre well off you probably have an obligation to share with people who are needy Burman said Charitable donations can be tracked only after candidates release their returns a tradition that has continued since former President Richard Nixon was in office  but some point out that none of this information which is often scrutinized is required to be provided by law If the biggest complaint voters can have from all these returns is whether   the candidate is charitable enough then this is a victory for all these candidates Tony Nitti a CPA and partner at Rubin Brown LLP told ABC News The fact that you have the transparency allows us to go through this exercise so we know that theres nothing to worry about Nitti said The Democrats who released their returns all appear to be paying their fair share of taxes given their income said Chris Edwards director of tax policy studies at the rightleaning Cato Institute None of these folks are seemingly cheating or getting away with anything he told ABC News after reviewing the returns made public by the campaigns Harris and her husband earning about 19 million paid at an effective tax rate of 37 the highest among candidates whove disclosed returns Gillibrand who reported earning 214083 had an effective tax rate of 14 according to her returns Sanders who released 10 years of returns Monday had an effective federal tax rate of 26 in 2018 paying 145840 in federal taxes on adjusted gross income of 561293 Warren with an adjusted gross income of 846394 in 2018 paid 27 With an adjusted gross income of 366455 in 2017 ORourke had an effective tax rate of 22 Klobuchar who had a 2018 adjusted gross income of 338121 and Inslee who had a 2018 adjusted gross income of 202912 round out the list with some of the lowest tax rates of 19 and 15 respectively There are often complaints that rich people are able to take lots of loopholes Edwards said referencing billionaire Warren Buffetts oftencited comments that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary None of these candidates seem to be as lucky as Warren Buffett They are paying tax rates as high as people with similar incomes While little is known about the presidents returns The New York Times reported last year that the president and his siblings allegedly used fake corporations to hide money received from their parents to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes The White House called The Times report a misleading attack against the Trump family and claimed the IRS signed off on the transactions detailed in the report While five candidates have released years of tax returns most among the nearly 20 Democrats seeking the White House in 2020 have yet to do so The president has refused to release his and the White House vows he likely wont Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush set the record for tax information released by a presidential candidate in 2016 by disclosing 33 years of returns The early disclosures more than a year away from the election are significant and represent a shift in the Democratic Party Joe Thorndike director of the Tax History Project told ABC News It doesnt take a rocket scientist

Krafts ownership of the Patriots  Robert Kraft the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots is being offered a deferred prosecution agreement in which he would not be required to plead guilty to any charges surrounding his visits to a Florida spa in January that was under investigation for sex trafficking and prostitution a prosecutor in the case announced on Tuesday Kraft is facing two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution for allegedly visiting the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter Florida on two occasions earlier this year and paying for sexual favors from the massage parlors staff The proposed pretrial diversion program would require Kraft to either acknowledge guilt or admit that he would have been proven guilty at trial according to the spokesperson for the Palm Beach County State Attorneys Office Mike Edmondson While Kraft is currently facing a statutory maximum of one year in jail if he were to accept the plea agreement the misdemeanor charges would be dropped As part of the statute Kraft would have to perform 100 hours of community service attend a class on the dangers of prostitution and pay a 5000 fine per count according to Edmondson The deal has been offered to Kraft and 24 other men charged in the case No one has accepted the deal so far Edmondson said The Wall Street Journal first reported news of a proposed deal Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg tweeted in response to the newspapers tweet of their story on the plea deal thatThe offer of a deferred prosecution agreement with several conditions to first time offenders is standard in cases like this It was not immediately clear whether Kraft would accept such an offer None of his three primary defense attorneys immediately responded to a request for comment A spokeswoman for the Jupiter Police Department which conducted the investigation referred requests for comment to the prosecutors office The Patriots team owner had pleaded not guilty and opted for a nonjury trial before a judge  while assembling a powerhouse team of highprofile Florida criminal defense attorneys Florida criminal defense attorney Mark OMara said that the Kraft deal is best outcome he could hope for short of a dismissal of the charges In a pretrial diversion you divert the case away from the criminal justice system into what Id call a preplea probation said OMara  who won George Zimmermans acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the fatal 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin This is a variant of a pretrial diversion  In my opinion a deferred prosecution agreement is much more informal more of a letter contract between the prosecution and the defense OMara said Its the best deal he can get but I give kudos to his defense attorneys because they worked out the best deal they could without a complete dismissal Its the best of all worlds because youre not entering a plea OMara said such deals are generally reserved for firsttime offenders Even with the charges dropped Kraft could still face discipline from the National Football League NFL which has a strict personal conduct policy The policy reads in part that it is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime We are all held to a higher standard and must conduct ourselves in a way that is responsible promotes the values of the NFL and is lawful Twentyfive people were charged in the sting at the Jupiter spa police said Authorities set up hidden cameras at the spa and Jupiter Police Detective Andrew Sharp said theres video evidence of all of the suspects participating in the alleged sexual acts Stacey James a spokeswoman for Kraft 77 said in a statement at the time that we categorically deny that Mr Kraft engaged in any illegal activity Because it is a judicial matter we will not be commenting further NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has punished Krafts Patriots more severely than any other franchise during his tenure according to ESPN He fined them 250000 and coach Bill Belichick 500000 for spying on an opponents defensive signals in 2007 He fined the Patriots 1 million stripped them of two draft choices and suspended quarterback Tom Brady as part of the 2015 Deflategate investigation News of the charges being dropped came the same day that a coalition of sexual exploitation and sex trafficking survivor networks wrote a letter calling on  Goodell to investigate criminal charges against Kraft and if found to be true to strip him of ownership of the Super Bowl champions franchise according to a letter released by the coalition on Tuesday If the results of an NFL investigation show Mr Kraft to have engaged in the purchase of women for sex the NFL must banish Mr Kraft from team ownership because men who purchase others for sex inflict inestimable amounts of human suffering on those they exploit for sex the letter reads which goes on to call for the sports league to take immediate action rigorous measures to create a corporate and sport culture that respects others by rejecting all forms of sexual objectification harassment assault and exploitation of women by owners coaches players team personnel and others associated with the NFL The prostitution marketplace is the context in which most sexual exploitation and sex trafficking transpire The prostitution marketplace encompasses any of the various modes by which prostitution is marketed strip clubs massage parlors escort services Internetbased prostitution websites brothels as well as pimpfacilitated streetlevel prostitution and pornography ie  prostitution for mass consumption The coalition which includes groups like Breaking the Silence Together Veronicas Voice Freedom From Exploitation Inc DIGNITY House and the Survivor Leader Network cite the NFLs own Personal Conduct Policy which describes misconduct as conduct by anyone in the league that is illegal violent dangerous or irresponsibly put innocent victims at risk damages the reputation of others in the game or undercuts public support for the NFL The NFLs media representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News The allegations against Kraft come three weeks

16,ABC,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/takeaways-1st-major-fundraising-reports-2020-presidential-race/story?id=62430583&cid=clicksource_4380645_null_icymi_image,The first major fundraising reports could be a roadmap for the race ahead Presidential candidates submitted their first quarter fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission FEC and its the first major barometer of who is breaking through in a crowded field and how wellresourced campaigns could be for the long race ahead But amid the clamor to scour the latest filings for indications of whos up and whos down its important to remember that a good fundraising haul is no guarantee of votes or viability And that uncertainty will continue to reign in the early stages of a historically diverse Democratic primary with well over a dozen declared candidates The reports show an incumbent Republican president eager to build a warchest sufficient enough to hold off any potential challenger and a Democratic race that will undoubtedly remain competitive up until the first nominating contests in 2020 It is also important to note that while former Vice President Joe Biden has not officially entered the race he is presumably a candidate who would draw major interest from donors of all sizes Here are five major takeaways from the reports filed with the FEC Top dollars Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont topped the Democratic field in the money race with relative ease bringing in an 182 million total haul followed by Sen Kamala Harris of California who brought in nearly 12 million Former Texas Congressman Beto ORourke raked in 94 million in the first quarter of 2019 including a 61 million haul in the first 24 hours of his campaign a total that surpassed even Sanders initial haul South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in an unexpectedly impressive haul for a candidate who is still introducing himself on the national stage Buttigieg who officially announced his candidacy this past weekend brought in over 7 million in the first quarter from over 155000 individual donors outpacing the four other US senators in the race and cementing his status as a toptier candidate in the campaigns early stages Mayor Pete also had a relatively low burn rate spending just 685000  or less than 10 percent  of his total fundraising haul Sen Elizabeth Warren brought in just over 6 million followed by her Senate colleagues Amy Klobuchar with 52 million Cory Booker with 5 million and Kirsten Gillibrand with 3 million   putting them all in the middle of the pack in terms of fundraising In another surprise entrepreneur Andrew Yang who raised 24 million in the first quarter outpaced two governors in the race Washington Gov Jay Inslee and Colorados former Gov John Hickenlooper Yang also outraised as Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney who loaned his campaign 117 million In terms of cash on hand Sanders also holds a significant advantage over the field with 157 million in the bank The early numbers also revealed the advantage sitting US senators  who ran reelection campaigns in 2018  have over the field Both Warren and Gillibrand transferred large sums from their Senate campaigns  Warren 104 million and Gillibrand 96 million  which gives them some more flexibility to spend more money early Warren spent 87 percent of the money she raised from individual contributions in the first quarter and Gillibrand burned through 81 percent both at much higher rates than the rest of the field Grassroots success A big theme emerging this cycle is the emphasis on the number of individual donors giving to a specific campaign both for its indication of a candidates grassroots support and because it is now one of the main criteria set forth by the Democratic National Committee DNC for making the debate stage Sanders again led the pack announcing earlier this month that his 181 million came from 525000 individual donors well beyond the 65000 required by the DNC and outpacing all of his rivals Not all campaigns released individual donor numbers but Warren said her haul came from 135000 individual donors while Buttigieg claimed over 155000 Yang said his campaign had 80000 individual donors to his campaign during February and March Both Harris and ORourkes campaigns said their totals came from 218000 individual contributions According to the FEC filings there were seven campaigns that raised a majority of their money from donors who gave 200 or less Sanders Warren Buttigieg Yang ORourke Gabbard and author Marianne Williamson On the flip side Gillibrand Booker Hickenlooper and Delaney all saw under 20 percent of their donations come from people who gave 200 or less With a larger emphasis on smalldollar donations and a rejection of corporate money expect the jockeying for the grassroots fundraising mantle to continue throughout the Democratic primary Trumps advantage While the field of Democrats battled for fundraising supremacy President Donald Trumps reelection campaign announced a more than 30 million haul in the first quarter of 2019 outpacing his top two rivals from the opposing party combined According to numbers released Monday morning by the Trump campaign the commanderinchief took in 303 million and has 408 million cash on hand The campaign did not release the number of individual donors to the presidents reelection campaign but claimed to have already enlisted 100000 new small donors in 2019 and to have acquired more than one million new small donors since Trump was inaugurated in January 2017 Along with the numbers reported by the Trump campaign the Republican National Committee announced Monday that it raised an additional 458 million in the first quarter of 2019 bringing the total proTrump fundraising effort to over 76 million with 82 million cash on hand Since his unlikely rise and victory in the 2016 Republican presidential primary Trump has proven to be a consistently productive fundraiser and the advantages that come with running as an incumbent president will likely aid that prowess as he seeks a second term Famous names As always the first round of FEC reports provide a unique opportunity to see who is donating to which campaigns at the outset Harris one of two Californiabased candidates in the race received donations from a number of famous names such as actors Ben Affleck Reese Witherspoon Eva Longoria Jon Hamm Wanda Sykes Taran Killam and Jon Cryer as well as producers JJ Abrams and Shonda Rhimes Among Bookers most highprofile donors include NBA Commissioner Adam Silver former Google head Eric Schmidt New Jersey Gov Phil Murphy and musician Jon Bon Jovi Booker also received donations from actress Rosario Dawson who he is currently dating Sanders received donations from actors Danny DeVito Susan Sarandon and Thomas Middleditch as well as musician Norah Jones Yang who has seen an uptick in attention in part due to the online engagement in his campaign received 1000 donations from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo and actor Noah Centineo who starred in the Netflix film To All the Boys Ive Loved Before Buttigieg also saw a number of donations from famous names like actors Mandy Moore Ryan Reynolds and Bradley Whitford former national security adviser and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice and James Murdoch the son of conservative media titan Rupert Murdoch Trumps over 30 million haul saw a wide range of donors including one of his biggest backers in 2016 Robert Mercer The prolific conservative donor gave 5400 in the first quarter of 2019 to the presidents reelection campaign Many of Trumps most highprofile backers like casino mogul Sheldon Adelson donate to outside groups and super PACs backing GOP causes Adelson and his wife Miriam donated over 100 million to GOPaligned groups during the 2018 midterm elections and are expected to be among Trumps biggest financial supporters during his reelection efforts Early signs of trouble As the data continues to be scrutinized there has been some worry among Democrats that these numbers even for toptier candidates like Sanders and Harris are lower than 2008 which was the last time the party saw a competitive primary In 2007 both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised more than 25 million in the first quarter albeit against a lesscrowded field which may be causing some donors to pause before deciding who they are backing According to an analysis by OpenSecrets a nonpartisan independent and nonprofit outlet that tracks campaign finance data the initial first quarter numbers appear to lag behind what the party saw in 2007 In additional to the potentially troubling overall numbers both Warren and Gillibrands early burn rates may signal difficulty in sustaining their campaigns all the way until the first ballots are cast in February 2020 Warren took a significant step when her campaign announced that she would not be holding highdollar fundraisers during the Democratic primary a decision that played well to a party base that is rewarding candidates who shirk the traditional norms of fundraising but may present a challenge to her when it comes to maintaining her war chest 247 coverage of breaking news and live events,0

21,Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/190226020435999.html,The US president and the North Korean leader are set to hold highstakes talks in Vietnams Hanoi this week Hanoi Vietnam  Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un are due to meet in Hanoi Vietnamxa0this weekxa0more thanxa0eight months after their landmark first summit in Singapore Heading into the talks on Wednesday and Thursday officials from both the United States and North Korea have not disclosed details about the focus of the meetings In an apparent bid to manage expectationsxa0the US president in recent days has said he is in no rush to achieve denuclearisation seeking instead a continuation of Pyongyangs pause onxa0weapons testing On the North Korean side an end to punishing international sanctions along with a formal declaration that the 19501953 Korean War is over are likely to be high on the priority listxa0 On the eve of the talks Al Jazeera takes a look at whats on the table in the USNorth Korea summit 20 In June last year Singapore hosted the first meeting between a US president and a North Korean leaderxa0 The historic summit which came after months of growing tensions marked by nuclear and missile tests fresh sanctions and threats of total destruction ended with a vague statement that has failed to produce tangible progress In Singapore Kim and Trump outlined four commitments establishing new relations for peace and prosperity building a lasting a stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula working towards denuclearisation and recovering and repatriating the remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War However the agreement did not explicitly define denuclearisation  leading to disagreements over what it means  nor did it detail a specific timeline for the destruction of North Koreas nuclear weapons arsenal As Trump has made clear the US is seeking an assurance from North Korea that it will stop testing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles It also wants Pyongyang to get rid of all its weapons for its mass destruction programmes as well as produce a roadmap and concrete plan of action on how it sets about achieving that goal A recent report by Stanford Universitys Centre for International Security and Cooperation said North Korea appears to have produced enough bomb fuel in the past year to add as many as seven nuclear weapons to its arsenal Stephen Biegun Trumps special envoy for North Korea hasxa0reportedlyxa0said that a dozen items on the agenda have been discussed during his recent trips to Pyongyang The two sides may discuss denuclearisation but Im predicting that Trump wants negotiations with North Korea to be a win domestically so he will shy away from concrete dates and expectations when it comes to the nuclear issuexa0Ben Young a North Korea analyst and historian told Al Jazeera I think they will try to nail down a peace treaty of some sort That is a winwin for both sides he added While some US politicians and analysts have speculated that Trump might agree to reduce the US military presence in South Korea  which totals around 28500 soldiers  officials in Seoul and Washington have said troop levels are not up for negotiation Patience with North Korea is not the worst option Pressure on Pyongyang and forcing them into a corner with concrete dates in the very near future for denuclearisation may make North Korea feel bullied and subservient said Young North Korea is fiercely prideful and takes it national dignity seriously The last thing the Trump administration wants is a return to the days of fire and fury Apart from the easing of sanctions and a declaration formally ending the Korean War North Korea is also calling for the relaunching of some interKorean economic projects and the opening of a US liaison office in Pyongyangxa0according to Biegunxa0 Hit by food shortages and burdened by USled international sanctions over its nuclear programme which have cut it off from most global trade North Korea last year shifted its focus to economic development KabWoo Ko a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul saidxa0Pyongyang needs to secure economic political and diplomatic benefits from this summit In case an agreement to officially end the Korean War is reached in Hanoi Ko said a close watch should be kept on which of the sides would eventually sign such a declaration It will be interesting to watch whether the deal is made between US and North Korea only or if it will include China he said The two Koreas are technically still at war as the hostilities stopped in 1953 with a truce signed by the US representing United Nations forces and the militaries of North Korea and China The armistice agreement  adhered to but not signed by South Korea whose leaders at the time rejected the idea of a ceasefire that left the peninsula divided  fell short of a peace treaty that has governed the conflict ever since On Monday a presidential spokesperson in Seoul said an endofwar statement by just two parties  Pyongyang and Washington  would be enough adding that the focus should be on leading North Korea to denuclearisation smoothly through the declaration The South Korean government welcomes any form of endofwar agreement if it plays a role to speed up denuclearisation    n     The talks in Hanoi follow a thaw in relations between North and South Korea last year which saw Kim and South Korean President Moon Jaein meeting three times During those summits the two leaders agreed to a series of goodwill gestures vowing to resume economic collaboration when possible and take steps to reduce military threats Just like Pyongyang the interKorean economic projects are also sought after by Seoul including the relaunch of operations at the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Park which has been suspended for three years Located just inside North Korea across the demilitarised zone the complex was launched in 2004 with the idea of South Korean companies manufacturing their products using North Korean labour helping it improve its economy To win some of those concessions from Washington North Korea could follow through on shutting its main Yongbyon nuclear complex as well as abolishing key missile facilities in the presence of foreign experts South Korean officials have said Moon has invested a lot of political and emotional capital in improving relations with the North Young said The South Korean economy is having some issues at the moment so Moon could use improved North KoreaUS relations as a mobilising force for improved domestic approval ratings Analysts do not anticipate the Hanoi summit to end with a deal that will see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons but have urgedxa0Washington to be open to taking interim steps for any agreement to be possible Despite hopes for a major breakthrough being slim therexa0  are some expectations the talks could produce a declaration formally ending the Korean Warxa0 For his part Ko said he wanted to see North Korea agree on a process to dismantle Yongbyon nuclear facility That facility according to Jeffrey Lewis a scholar at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey is functional Its really businessasusual at Yongbyon at the moment said Lewis People show up for work and material comes in and it looks pretty much like its looked for the last 10 or 15 years Ko predicted that the talks in Hanoi would seexa0the US give North Korea some benefits that it needed on the political military and economic fronts but warned against walking away from Hanoi in the same hollow manner as the Singapore summit The talk in Singapore was like Sanggyeonnye in Korea  the first meeting between families of the bridge bride and the groom Now

likely to be left out US Attorney General William Barr plans to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Muellers report on the inquiry into Russias role in the 2016 US election on Thursday  the keyword being redacted The Democrats demands for a full unredacted version of Muellers report are likely to prompt a political and legal battle that could last for months if not much longer The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler has said he is prepared to issue subpoenas very quickly for the full report on Russia and Donald Trumps presidential campaign if it is released with blackedout sections And that would set the legal fight in motion Barr has said he is redacting four types of information from the report Congressional Democrats cite precedent from previous investigations in saying they want to see it all But some Republicans defending Barr are also citing precedent saying it is appropriate to keep at least some of the information from Congress and the public Heres a look at whats likely to be withheld and why Democrats say the full report should be released Barr has staked out his position on releasing secret grand jury information saying last week that he would not go to court to request its release He said Democrats are free to go to court themselves and Nadler has said he is ready to do soxa0 Grand jury information including witness interviews is normally off limits but can be obtained in court Some records were eventually released in the Whitewater investigation into former President Bill Clinton and an investigation into President Richard Nixon before he resigned Both of those cases were under somewhat different circumstances including that the House Judiciary Committee had initiated impeachment proceedings Federal court rules state that a court may order disclosure preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding But Democrats have said they are not interested in impeachment for now and are likely to argue in court that they dont need to be in an official impeachment proceeding to receive the materials Congress frequently receives classified documents and briefings and Democrats say there is no reason the Mueller report should be any different Many Republicans agree including the top Republican on the intelligence committee Devin Nunes who wrote a rare joint letter in March with House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff asking for all materials regardless of form or classificationxa0 In the letter which was obtained by The Associated Press Schiff and Nunes also asked for a private briefing from Mueller and his team Democrat Schiff has argued that some of that information should be released to the public as well citing Mueller indictments that have already revealed granular detail about the Russian effort to influence the 2016 election All of that information at one point was classified but the decision must have been made the public interest outweighs that And I think a similar analysis should be undertaken here Schiff said on CNN this month Barr said he will redact information related to investigations connected to the Mueller probe that is still under way Those include cases handed off or referred to federal prosecutors in Washington DC New York and Virginia Democrats have noted that the Justice Department has released such information before including some related to Muellers own investigation while it was in progress Republicans who were in the House majority last year obtained documents related to the beginnings of the Russia investigation arguing that officials were biased against thencandidate Trumpxa0 Republicans argued at the time that it was necessary to obtain that information to maintain the integrity of the investigation The Justice Department regularly redacts information about people who were interviewed or scrutinised in investigations but not charged Barr has said he will black out information from the report that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties Asked by Senator Jeanne Shaheen at a hearing last week if that meant he would redact information to protect the interests of Trump Barr said it did not No Im talking about people in private life not public officeholders Barr said That means that in addition to Trump members of his family who work at the White House such as his daughter Ivanka could potentially be named if they were somehow entangled in Muellers investigation But any information regarding his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr who run his businesses could be more likely to be redactedxa0 The Justice Department did release information about the investigation into Hillary Clintons email practices more than two years ago even though Clinton wasnt charged But that was after thenFBI Director James Comey made the muchquestioned decision to publicly discuss that investigation Barr signalled in his confirmation hearing in January that he would do things differently If youre not going to indict someone then you dont stand up there and unload negative information about the person Barr said Thats not the way the Department of Justice does business Follow Al Jazeera English,0

opposed by the European Union The Trump administration on Wednesday opened the door for lawsuits against foreign firms operating on properties Cuba seized from Americans after the 1959 revolution US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he will not renew a bar on litigation that has been in place for two decades meaning that lawsuits can be filed starting on May 2 when the current suspension expires The major policy shift which the State Department said could draw hundreds of thousands of legal claims worth tens of billions of dollars appears intended to intensify pressure on Havana at a time Washington is demanding that it end its support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro The move comes despite opposition from the European Unionxa0 Any person or company doing business in Cuba should heed this announcement Pompeo said Pompeo said the administration was acting because it recognised the reality that the bar on lawsuits which has been in place since 1996 had not achieved the goal of pressing Cuba to enact democratic reforms or reining in what he called Cubas export of oppression throughout the Western Hemisphere particularly in Venezuela We see clearly that regimes repression of its own people and unrepentant exportation of tyranny in the region has only gotten worse because dictators perceive appeasement as weakness not strength he told reporters Pompeos decision gives Americans the legal right to sue companies that operate out of hotels tobacco factories distilleries and other properties Cuba nationalised after Fidel Castro took power It allows lawsuits by Cubans who became United Statesxa0citizens years after their properties were takenxa0 Those citizens opportunities for justice have been put out of reach for two decades Pompeo said There are roughly 6000 claims that the Justice Department has certified as having merit according to Kimberly Breier the top US diplomat for the Americas Those claims have an estimated value of eight billion dollars two billion in property and six billion in interest she said In addition there are about 200000 uncertified claims that could run into the tens of billions of dollars she said Breier said there would be no exceptions to the decision which has already prompted stern responses from Canada and Europe as they have vowed to protect their businesses from lawsuits She said the only way companies will be safe from litigation would be to ensure that they are not doing business on expropriated properties European companies that are operating in Cuba will have nothing to worry about if they are not operating on properties taken from Americans she said The decision deals a severe blow to Havanas efforts to draw foreign investment to the island and comes as President Donald Trumpxa0steps up pressure to isolate embattled Venezuelan President Maduro who is holding power with help from other countries including Cuba China and Russiaxa0 Spain which has large investments in hotels and other tourismrelated industries on the island was the first to react A senior government official told The Associated Press that Madrid would ask the EU to challenge the US move through the World Trade Organization Businesses from Canada France and the UK among other countries also conduct business in properties nationalised after Castro took power National Security Adviser John Bolton is expected to discuss the new policy during a speech in Miami home to thousands of exiles and immigrants from Cuba Venezuela and Nicaragua The speech at the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association is to be delivered on the 58th anniversary of the failed US invasion of the island in 1961 an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government Johana Tablada Cubas deputy director of US affairs said on Twitter Before they try to euphorically ride a wave of wickedness and lies they should take a dose of reality The world has told John Bolton and the US government to eliminate the criminal blockade against Cuba and the HelmsBurton Act The 1996 act gave Americans the right to sue the mostly European companies Countries with large investments in Cuba have ferociously protested the lawxa0 The extraterritorial application of the US embargo is illegal and violates international law said Alberto Navarro the EU ambassador to Cuba I personally consider it immoral For 60 years the only thing thats resulted from the embargo is the suffering of the Cuban people US airlines and cruise lines that carry hundreds of thousands of travellers to Cuba each year appear to be exempt from the key provision of the HelmsBurton Act Every US president since Bill Clinton has suspended the key clause to avoid those trade clashes and a potential mass of lawsuits that would prevent any future settlement with Cuba over nationalised properties Cuba has said it is willing to reimburse the owners of confiscated properties but only if the communist government is also reimbursed for billions of dollars in damages generated by the sixdecade US trade embargo The announcement comes at a moment of severe economic weakness for Cuba which is struggling to find enough cash to import basic food and other supplies

33,Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/asylum-seekers-show-credible-fear-eligible-bond-190417130324858.html,Rights group vows to fight Attorney General Barrs decision that expands indefinite detention for many asylum seekers Detained asylum seekers in the United States who have shown they have a credible fear of returning to their country will no longer be able to ask a judge to grant them release using bond according to a ruling by US Attorney General William Barr who overturned decadesold policy on Tuesday Barr struck down a decision that had allowed some asylum seekers to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge in a ruling that expands indefinite detention for some migrants who must wait months or years for their cases to be heard The first immigration court ruling from President Donald Trumps newly appointed attorney general is in keeping with the administrations moves to clamp down on the asylum process as tens of thousands of mostly Central Americans cross into the United States asking for refuge US immigration courts are overseen by the Justice Department and the attorney general can rule in cases to set a legal precedent Barrs ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration This year the administration implemented a policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases work their way through backlogged courts a policy which has been challenged with a lawsuit Several top officials at the Department of Homeland Security DHS were forced out this month over Trumps frustrations with an influx of migrants and asylum seekers at the US southern border Barrs decision applies to migrants who crossed between official ports of entry into the US Typically those migrants are placed in expedited removal proceedings  a faster form of deportation reserved for people who irregularly entered the country within the last two weeks and are detained within 100 miles 160km of a land border Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond But before Barrs ruling those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecutionxa0 I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States Barr wrote Barr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude or if DHS decides to release them by granting them parole DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons The decision doesnt affect asylumseeking families because they generally cant be held for longer than 20 days It also doesnt apply to unaccompanied minors Barr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions Michael Tan from the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU said the rights group intended to sue the Trump administration over the decision and immigrant advocates decried the decision Well see the administration in court Again the ACLU tweetedOur Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process Angelo Guisado a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights tweeted Mandating detention for what amounts to seeking asylum at the southern border is another instantiation of criminalizing migration I find it perverse that we mandate detention fing jail for what is at best a civil offense and is more aptly a placeofbirth violation We detain over 440000 noncitizens each year FY 2018 Congress approved 40520 detention beds though the daily average is closer to 45000 As of March ICE had 50049 people in custody Trump aims to make it to 60000 and this abomination of a decision will help get him there httpstcojW6Bjc5Hfd  Angelo Guisado VoltaireLaFlare April 16 2019  The decisions full impact is not yet clear because it will in large part depend on the ability of DHS to expand detention said Steve Vladeck a law professor at the University of Texas The number of asylum seekers who will remain in potentially indefinite detention pending disposition of their cases will be almost entirely a question of DHSs detention capacity and not whether the individual circumstances of individual cases warrant release or detention Vladeck said DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision The agency had written in a brief in the case arguing that eliminating bond hearings for the asylum seekers would have an immediate and significant impact on  detention operationsxa0 In early March Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE the DHS agency responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants in the country irregularly said the average daily population of immigrants in detention topped 46000 for the 2019 fiscal year the highest level since the agency was created in 2003 Last year Reuters news agency reported that ICE had modified a tool officers have been using since 2013 when deciding whether an immigrant should be detained or released on bond making the process more restrictive Barrs decision came after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to review the case in October Sessions resigned from his position in November leaving the case to Barr to decide Follow Al Jazeera English,0

36,Alternet,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/heres-what-republicans-and-billionaires-really-mean-when-they-talk-about-freedom/,America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word socialism Wed be better served if instead we were debating the meaning of freedom The Oregonian reported last week that fully 156000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our smallpopulation state Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent and none of them has any savings one medical bill major car repair or job loss and theyre on the streets While socialism may or may not solve their problem the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem but as a symptom of a free society The words freedom and liberty are iconic in American cultureprobably more so than with any other nation because theyre so intrinsic to the literature declarations and slogans of our nations founding The ironyof the nation founded on the worlds greatest known genocide the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native Americans and over three centuries of legalized slavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slavesis extraordinary It presses us all to bring true freedom and liberty to all Americans But what do those words mean If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddieswho slap those words on pretty much everything they doyoud get a definition that largely has to do with being free from taxation and regulation And truth be told if youre morbidly rich that makes a certain amount of sense particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer regardless of your behaviors impact on workingclass people the environment or the ability of government to function On the other hand the definition of freedom and liberty thats been embraced by socalled democratic socialist countriesfrom Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australiayoud hear a definition thats closer to that articulated by Franklin D Roosevelt when he proposed in January 1944 a second Bill of Rights to be added to our Constitution FDRs proposed amendments included the right to a job and the right to be paid enough to live comfortably the right to adequate food and clothing and recreation the right to start a business and run it without worrying about unfair competition and domination by monopolies the right of every family to a decent home the right to adequate medical care to achieve and enjoy good health the right to governmentbased protection from the economic fears of old age sickness accident and unemployment and the right to a good education Roosevelt pointed out that All of these rights spell security He added Americas own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelts advice to heart Progressive social democracy has kept Europe Canada and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a centurya mindboggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since the 1500s Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932 the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for todays GOP In 1920 Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of more industry in government less government in industryprivatize and deregulateand a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent He kept both promises putting the nation into a sugarhigh spin called the Roaring 20s where the rich got fabulously rich and workingclass people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize Harding Coolidge and Hoover the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932 all cheered on the assaults using phrases like the right to work to describe a unionfree nation In the end the result of the horses and sparrows economics advocated by Harding feed more oats to the horses and therell be more oats in the horse poop to fatten the sparrowsthat generations version of trickledown economics was the Republican Great Depression yes they called it that until after World War II Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popularthe only president to be elected four timesthe rightwingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called socialist programs like Social Security the right to unionize and governmentguaranteed job programs including the WPA REA CCC and others The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwidenearly 30000 in Madison Square Garden aloneencouraged by wealthy and powerful economic royalists preaching freedom and liberty Like the Kochs Freedomworks that generations huge and wellfunded principally by the DuPonts chemical fortune organization was the Liberty League Roosevelts generation had seen the results of this kind of hardright freedom rhetoric in Italy Spain Japan and Germany the very nations with which we were then at war Speaking of the grave dangers of rightist reaction in this Nation Roosevelt told America in that same speech that If history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the socalled normalcy of the 1920sthen it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home Although rightwingers are still working hard to disassemble FDRs New Dealthe GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security as well as to Medicare and Medicaidwe got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the United States The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that freedom means the government doesnt provide any of the things listed above Instead they tell us as Ron Paul famously did in a GOP primary debate years ago that if were broke and sick were free to die like a feral dog in the gutter Freedom is homelessness in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP Poverty lack of education no access to health care poorpaying jobs and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society they tell us which is why Americas lowest life expectancy highest maternal and childhood death rates lowest levels of education and lowest pay are almost all in GOPcontrolled states Americaparticularly the Democratic Partyis engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of socialism It would be a big help for all

37,Alternet,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/white-nationalists-have-infiltrated-the-us-military/,Patrick Casey came to the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC on a mission Casey executive director of Identity Evropa a white nationalist group that was involved in the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville Va in 2017 believes diversity is harmful to the United States and aims to create a white supermajority He told NBC in an interview at CPAC that his organization aims to take over the GOP as much as possible If Identify Evropa hasnt taken over the GOP as Casey hoped his organization HuffPost reports Monday has made inroads into another key institution the military Seven members have been identified as Identity Evropa members according to HuffPosts investigation HuffPost identified these members through leaked online chat logs from a server on Discord a chat app popular among altright groups which Identity Evropa members have used to communicate with each other for years The independent media group Unicorn Riot first published the logs last week In its investigation HuffPost found that Two Marines two Army ROTC cadets an Army physician a member of the Texas National Guard and one member of the Air Force all belong to  Identity Evropa After Unicorn Riot released the chat logs another antifascist collective Identify Evropa reviewed them and used biographical details from the posts which were written under pseudonyms to begin to determine their actual identities HuffPost then used that research to continue its own and verified the identities of seven service members Their messages HuffPost reporter Christopher Mathias writes indicate that they hold deeply racist and antiSemitic views and participate in Identity Evropa propaganda campaigns posting stickers and flyers in cities and on college campuses One of the military personnel revealed by HuffPost was Stephen T Farrea 29 who as a military spokesperson confirmed is a corporal in the Selected Marine Corps Reserve He posted under the name SuperTomPerryRI and frequently referenced his Marine Corps position Among his racist comments were statements including Portsmouth my town 95 percent white very nice and that he was looking forward to posting Its OK to be white flyers According to HuffPost Last week he attended an Identity Evropa gathering in Kentucky also attended by Jason Laguardia a lance corporal who posts on Discord under the name JasonCT Laguardia often posts pictures of Identity Evropa flyers and stickers  throughout Connecticut and New York City This revelation isnt the first indication of concern over the presence and power of white nationalists in the US armed forces As Mathias writes Last year a series of investigative reports by ProPublica and Frontline found multiple members of violent neoNazi groups among the ranks of the military And a 2017 poll conducted by the Military Times found that nearly 25 percent of service members surveyed said they encountered white nationalists within their ranks That poll found that 30 percent of troops said they saw white nationalism as a bigger threat to national security than the wars in Syria Afghanistan and Iraq Identity Evropa was founded by an exMarine HuffPost spoke with multiple experts who expressed concern over the impact of white nationalists in the armed forces Military personnel active duty and veterans alike said Kathleen Belew author of Bring the War Home The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America have played an instrumental role in moving weapons training and tactics from military to civilian spaces and she continued dramatically escalated the impact of white power violence on civilian populations Daryle Jenkins an Air Force veteran and founder of One Peoples Project an antiracist group told HuffPost he was concerned about the safety of nonwhite Christian service members who must serve alongside white nationalists who might as he explained undermine and threaten their fellow soldiers These revelations come on the heels of concerns over white nationalists in government Rep Steve King RIowa told The New York Times in January White nationalist white supremacist Western civilizationhow did that language become offensive Rep Steve Scalise RLa once allegedly described himself as David Duke without the baggage as the Times reported in 2014 Following the release of the chat logs and HuffPost requests for comment The military is determining whether they violated rules regarding discrimination and extremist activity Mathias writes Scalise and King remain in Congress Read HuffPosts full article with the list of service members and their Discord posts here   So do we  The past year has been the most arduous of our lives The Covid19 pandemic continues to be

42,Alternet,https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/evangelical-christianity-facing-political-crisis-it-will-need-more-makeover/,Ok evangelicals do have a brand problembut they also have a major product problem Biblebelieving bornagain Christians aka evangelicals have had a brand problem since Jerry Falwells Moral Majority sold the bornagain movement to the Republican party in exchange for political power a generation ago forging the religious right The Republican party has been using Christianitys good name to cover bad deeds ever since all the while tapping evangelical media empires and churches as communications and organizing platforms to bring ordinary believers along with the merger Having become truebelievers themselves Evangelical leaders have offered themselves up as trusted messengers for this NewandImproved political gospel project And it has worked Bornagain Christians havent given up their core beliefs that the Bible is the literally perfect word of God Jesus died for their sins and folks who dont accept this gift will burn forever in Hell Rather most white evangelicals and a number of blacks and Hispanics have appended parts of the Republican policy agenda and the underlying conceptual framework to this list Religious beliefs and political beliefs have become for many evangelicals indistinguishable objects of devotion beyond question Political tribe and religious tribe now have the same boundaries When Ixa0outlinedxa0evangelicalisms brand problem in early 2016 few of us had any idea how bad it could get Now the world associates the term Evangelical with the Trump electionover 80 percent of evangelicals gave him their voteand with the candidacy of theocrat Roy Moore who despite credible allegations that he pursued and pawed young teens while an assistant district attorney received comparable support from white Alabama evangelicals In the aftermath of Moores campaign and merciful defeat the minority of Evangelical Christians who found him horrifying are doing some public soul searchingwell except not really Many recognize only the brand problem and are more than anything simply scrambling to get away from the term evangelical itself After Trump and Moore some evangelicals are finding their own label too toxic to usexa0reportsxa0the Washington Postxa0 The term feels irreversibly tainted agrees evangelical author Jen Hatmaker Jemar Tisby is president of a faithbased media company catering to black evangelicals but hexa0saysxa0that Its counterproductive to identify as evangelical    Whats happened with evangelicalism is it has become so conflated with Republican politics that you cant tell where Christianity ends and partisanship begins At Wheaton College my old alma mater the executive director of the Billy Graham Center Ed Stetzerxa0said I dont want evangelical to mean people who supported candidates with significant and credible accusations against them If evangelical means that it has serious ramifications for the work of Christians and churches At Princeton University the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship renamed itself Princeton Christian Fellowship to get away from the negative associations But is evangelicalism tainting Christianity itself as a brand Five years ago Campus Crusade for Christwhich spends over 500000000 annually to recruit and retain evangelical college studentschanged its name to the less transparent Cru Mark Galli editorinchief at Christianity Today wrote of the Moore race There is already one loser Christian faithNo one will believe a word we say perhaps for a generation Christianitys integrity is severely tarnished What even thoughtful evangelical leaders like Galli fail to recognize is that peoplexa0shouldntxa0believe a word they saynot about politics not about morality and not even about theology at this point The problem isnt skin deep Their brand problem is a function of their product problem and as Emmett Price at GordonCornwell Theological Seminary put it Ditching a term is simply ditching a term Abandoning the term evangelical is the most superficial fix conceivable Real soul searching would mean asking what it is about the evangelical worldview that has made evangelical leaders and ordinary Biblebelievers susceptible to courtship by authoritarian bigoted sexist tribal antiintellectual greedmongers who dangle the carrot of theocracy But few evangelical leaders are asking this question because that would mean revisiting the peculiar status they grant to the Bible itself Andxa0thatxa0is offlimits When one treats the Bible as the literally perfect and complete word of Godwhich most Christian scholars dont but most evangelicals doit isnt hard to find support for every item in the ugly list that now darkens the evangelical brand The Bible contains somexa0really bad ideasxa0 The opposite is also true mind you It also contains support for compassion love generosity inclusion and humilityand many other virtues that humanity values widely across both secular and religious wisdom traditions The Bible is morally inchoate It documents and sanctifies humanitys moral infancy and idolizing the bookxa0binds believers to the worldview of the Iron Age leaving them susceptible to justifying all manner of misbehaviors in the name of god That is precisely what the Republican operatives of the religious right have done and as evangelical leaders got sucked into the merger of biblical theology and conservative dogma that is precisely whatxa0theyxa0have done and as they have spread this infectious product to the followers who trust them that is precisely whatxa0theyxa0have done too At the bottom of this shitflow sequence sit children born into households of true believers who isolated them in homeschooling and church schools then send them to institutions like Bob Jones or Liberty University or Wheaton so that identity cemented they can carry forward the project unquestioned So evangelicals have three enormous and interrelated problems with their product at this point One is that their whole enterprise is built on an indefensible view of the Bible This has facilitated the merger of biblical Christianity with Republican dogmas and will leave believers vulnerable to this kind of exploitation until the theology itself is fixed The second problem is that millions of Christians have now been so thoroughly indoctrinated into Biblesanctified Republican ideology that it could take a generation to move them away from the beliefs and priorities that elected Donald Trump and nearly elected Roy Moore It took a generation to bind them into this tangled web and there is no reason to think that journeying free will be easier The third problem is that this whole state of affairs has been a profound violation of trust People trust religious leaders to be honest and moral and when that is gone little influence remains Young people who see through the mess are leaving evangelicalism and Christianity They are losing faith in faith itself This muchxa0isxa0clear Simply swapping in the term Christian for the term evangelical will only damage Christianitys brand at large which evangelicals have already donewith help of course from the Catholic hierarchy As a former evangelical Christian now a spiritual nontheist I dont necessarily think of that as a bad thing but Christians should Some reformers are attempting real change from within evangelicalismxa0Tony Campoloxa0Rachel Held Evansxa0Rob Bellxa0andxa0John Pavlovitz to cite a few are fighting hard to save the soul of a faith they cherish But a path to broad reformation remains unclear   So do we  The past year has been the most arduous of our lives The Covid19 pandemic continues to be catastrophic not only to our health  mental and physical  but also to the stability of millions of people For all of us independent news organizations its no exception  Weve covered everything thrown at us this past year and will continue to do so with your support Weve

49,Alternet,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/a-cognitive-scientist-explains-why-everyone-is-at-risk-of-falling-for-fake-news-and-how-to-resist-it/,Julian Matthews Monash University Although the term itself is not new fake news presents a growing threat for societies across the world  Only a small amount of fake news is needed to disrupt a conversation and at extremes it can have an impact on democratic processes including elections            Read more  We made deceptive robots to see why fake news spreads and found a weakness But what can we do to avoid fake news at a time when we could be waiting a while for mainstream media and social networks to step up and address the problem  From a psychology perspective an important step in tackling fake news is to understand why it gets into our mind We can do this by examining how memory works and how memories become distorted  Using this viewpoint generates some tips you can use to work out whether youre reading or sharing fake news  which might be handy in the coming election period  Fake news often relies on misattribution  instances in which we can retrieve things from memory but cant remember their source Misattribution is one of the reasons advertising is so effective We see a product and feel a pleasant sense of familiarity because weve encountered it before but fail to remember that the source of the memory was an ad  One study examined headlines from fake news published during the 2016 US Presidential Election The researchers found even one presentation of a headline such as Donald Trump Sent His Own Plane to Transport 200 Stranded Marines based on claims shown to be false was enough to increase belief in its content This effect persisted for at least a week was still found when headlines were accompanied by a factcheck warning and even when participants suspected it might be false Repeated exposure can increase the sense that misinformation is true Repetition creates the perception of group consensus that can result in collective misremembering a phenomenon called the Mandela Effect It might be harmless when people collectively misremember something fun such as a childhood cartoon did the Queen in Disneys Snow White really NOT say Mirror mirror But it has serious consequences when a false sense of group consensus contributes to rising outbreaks of measles Scientists have investigated whether targeted misinformation can promote healthy behaviour Dubbed falsememory diets it is said that false memories of food experiences can encourage people to avoid fatty foods alcohol and even convince them to love asparagus Creative people that have a strong ability to associate different words are especially susceptible to false memories Some people might be more vulnerable than others to believe fake news but everyone is at risk  Bias is how our feelings and worldview affect the encoding and retrieval of memory We might like to think of our memory as an archivist that carefully preserves events but sometimes its more like a storyteller Memories are shaped by our beliefs and can function to maintain a consistent narrative rather than an accurate record An example of this is selective exposure our tendency to seek information that reinforces our preexisting beliefs and to avoid information that brings those beliefs into question This effect is supported by evidence that television news audiences are overwhelmingly partisan and exist in their own echo chambers  It was thought that online communities exhibit the same behaviour contributing to the spread of fake news but this appears to be a myth Political news sites are often populated by people with diverse ideological backgrounds and echo chambers are more likely to exist in real life than online  Our brains are wired to assume things we believe originated from a credible source But are we more inclined to remember information that reinforces our beliefs This is probably not the case People who hold strong beliefs remember things that are relevant to their beliefs but they remember opposing information too This happens because people are motivated to defend their beliefs against opposing views  Belief echoes are a related phenomenon that highlight the difficulty of correcting misinformation Fake news is often designed to be attentiongrabbing  It can continue to shape peoples attitudes after it has been discredited because it produces a vivid emotional reaction and builds on our existing narratives  Corrections have a much smaller emotional impact especially if they require policy details so should be designed to satisfy a similar narrative urge to be effective The way our memory works means it might be impossible to resist fake news completely            Read more  How to help kids navigate fake news and misinformation online But one approach is to start thinking like a scientist This involves adopting a questioning attitude that is motivated by curiosity and being aware of personal bias For fake news this might involve asking ourselves the following questions What type of content is this Many people rely on social media and aggregators as their main source of news By reflecting on whether information is news opinion or even humour this can help consolidate information more completely into memory Where is it published Paying attention to where information is published is crucial for encoding the source of information into memory If something is a big deal a wide variety of sources will discuss it so attending to this detail is important Who benefits Reflecting on who benefits from you believing the content helps consolidate the source of that information into memory It can also help us reflect on our own interests and whether our personal biases are at play  Some people tend to be more susceptible to fake news because they are more accepting of weak claims  But we can strive to be more reflective in our openmindedness by paying attention to the source of information and questioning our own knowledge if and when we are unable to remember the context of our memories Julian Matthews Research Officer  Cognitive Neurology Lab Monash University This article is

51,"American Spectator, The",https://spectator.org/college-scam-thats-not-the-half-of-it/,   The biggest college scandal in our history exclaims a news reader referring to the indictment of William Singer who organized a scheme so the wealthy could bypass the college admissions process and get their children into prestigious schools through a combination of fraud deceit and bribery The scandal might not have received the attention it generated had it not been for actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman getting caught in the FBIs net If there are celebrities involved the story must be important As offensive as this scandal is it is nowhere near the biggest college scandal in our history Our colleges and universities have long been mired in ongoing scandals but they are so common that we hardly consider them newsworthy College tuition and textbook costs have climbed faster than any other component of the economy At the same time the value of a college degree in fields of questionable economic utility have correspondingly diminished This has left many dropouts as well as graduates with large debt obligations and no real means to repay them Some seventy percent of college graduates carry student debt which now amounts to over a trillion and a half dollars Part of this is the unintended consequence of easily available governmentbacked loan programs and the propagation of the myth that a college degree translates into much higher income over a lifetime Remove the scientific and engineering fields from the equation and the myth crumbles as fast as the interest payments on student debt rise About 44 of college graduates end up in jobs that do not require a college education Many employers require a college degree where a good high school education would more than suffice Colleges raised tuition knowing that students could easily borrow money What started as a benign program ended up like many government programs causing disastrous effects not only for individuals but also for the entire economy But there is another problem Before we expanded the population base that colleges serve it was possible for a student to go through college and acquire some fundamental and marketable skills in writing public speaking economics and mathematics Those skills once set the college graduate apart from the larger population even if the students major did not have a direct economic translation Businesses did not always want graduates with business degrees but they did want graduates who could write a coherent paragraph speak extemporaneously and understand how to do research and interpret qualitative and quantitative data The dirty secret of higher education is that the ability to acquire those skills requires both above average intelligence and motivation Those joint attributes are probably present in no more than fifteen percent of the population Yet colleges and universities are recruiting from about 65 of high schoolxa0graduates and telling them they can be successful as college students More than half will not have a degree after six years but they will have student debt Many colleges and universities lower standards to accommodate students of lower ability and motivation and despite this many drop out because the experience has no attraction for them This does not apply to all institutions Elite institutions and competitive departments in science technology engineering and mathematics even at otherwise nonelite schools can continue to recruit top students who will benefit from the experience Dedicated and talented liberal arts students do acquire intellectual skills that will serve them in their careers But those liberal arts students are the exceptions The socalled cake majors absorb the intellectually challenged and motivationally limited students The role of these departments is to create an environment where these students will feel successful and be pushed through toward a degree Nonetheless except for elite schools the dropout rates reveal the scam behind the system There is little that is secret about this During finals administrators are known to openly tell faculty sometimes in writing to remember the institutions laudable commitment to retention and diversity You do not need a doctorate to comprehend the meaning of such messages Such departments are also sandboxes for playing at social justice and indoctrinating students in leftist ideology They are forums for telling students what to think not teaching them how to think From the administrative perch they are safety valves for students to act out demonstrate shut down speakers and otherwise make noise while the real work of the university continues unimpeded In some institutions there is even a significant geographic distance between the engineering science and technical colleges and the rest of the campus Real students in demanding programs have neither the time nor the energy to engage in demonstrations Finding a computer science student at a campus demonstration is as likely as finding a prolife speaker on a womens studies panel Part of the campus deception is to encourage minorities to believe that a college degree is a passport to social mobility It is if you are qualified and accepted in a program that has some relationship to the demands of the economy But a degree in minority studies where you learn how to be a more engaged minority is only slightly less useful than a degree in most of the social sciences Entire departments and graduate programs exist to recruit a captive audience of students who largely will receive no intellectual benefit from the experience but they will pay tuition and subsequently carry the burden of a student loan More important when the cultural auditors descend from Washington to evaluate the institutions progress on diversity these departments are the places to showcase both minority admissions and minority faculty recruitment Of course nearly everyone in academia has known for decades that if some are underrepresented there are others who are overrepresented and must move to the sidelines The lawsuit by Asian students against Harvard is decades overdue and one hopes that white students will continue to launch similar suits The problems confronting our colleges and universities are far greater than a single scandal Higher education needs reform starting with the imposition of standards the removal of socalled studies departments a commitment to open inquiry protections of free speech from thugs who think the hecklers veto is enshrined in the Constitution and an end to admissions and hiring by ascription When that happens maybe it will be worth bribing somebody to accept your intellectually challenged and unmotivated children But in the current state of things the efforts by William Singer and his clients was probably an unnecessary waste of time money and legal risk without any likelihood of securing

52,"American Spectator, The",https://spectator.org/the-attack-on-tucker-carlson/,   There they go again The antifree press Media Matters for America or as I called them a while back in this space the Media Matters Fascistsxa0 they the far left wing group that has been repeatedly flagged for its antiSemitism as here and here is out there again targeting another conservative media host This time  again  it is Tucker Carlson It seems that back in the stone age of the early 21st century Tucker said blahblahblah on some radio shock jock show and so of course all these years later  off with his head We have written about this Media Matters game before They are used as the tip of the spear in the arsenal of the Leftist State Media the latters objective being to bring back their onetime monopoly on the news and just how and who gets to present it or discuss it Tucker  in this case  stands in the way So the idea is to get him More of which in a moment Recall that back in 2012 the founder of Media Matters David Brock wrote an entire book about his obsession with destroying Fox News Titled The Fox Effect How Roger Ailes Turned a Network Into a Propaganda Machine Aside from pushing antiSemitism publishing articles on Israel Firsters  now they are all about defending the antiSemitic Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar  the Media Matters Fascists are determined to shut down any and every conservative host on television or radio I have written several times over the years about their campaigns to get Rush Limbaugh or Lou Dobbs or Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity or Laura Ingraham or Tucker Carlson and who knows who else off the air Oh yes eventually I annoyed them enough that they came after me too CNN shamelessly caved In the case of Tucker Carlson doubtless there is a special animosity because it is the Carlsonfoundedxa0Daily Caller that back there in 2012 did a deep dive into Media Matters Since they wish to talk about Tucker Carlson  lets refresh what the Daily Callerxa0uncovered about Media Matters There was thisxa0DCxa0story  bylined byTucker Carlson with Vince Coglianese that headlined INSIDE MEDIA MATTERS SOURCES MEMOS REVEAL ERRATIC BEHAVIOR CLOSE COORDINATION WITH WHITE HOUSE AND NEWS ORGANIZATIONS This story reported in part of founder Brock He had more security than a Third World dictator one employee said explaining that Brocks bodyguards would rarely leave his side even accompanying him to his home in an affluent Washington neighborhood each night where they stood post to protect him What movement leader has a detail asked someone who saw it Extensive interviews with a number of Brocks current and former colleagues at Media Matters as well as with leaders from across the spectrum of Democratic politics reveal an organization roiled by its leaders volatile and erratic behavior and struggles with mental illness and an office where Brocks executive assistant carried a handgun to public events in order to defend his boss from unseen threats Then there was the aforementioned story of the groups antiSemitic problem headlined MEDIA MATTERS EXECUTIVE WROTE RACIST ANTISEMITIC ANTITRANNY BLOG POSTS That story began A top executive at Media Matters for America and the principal activist in the Stop Rush campaign made racist and antiSemitic comments and disparaged trannies on a dormant blog that he wrote just several years prior to his prominent liberal activism career Blog entries reviewed by The Daily Caller show that Angelo Carusone made derogatory remarks about ethnic groups and used language to insult trannies and ugly gays that would be considered hate speech by his own organization Carusone is the executive vice president of the George Sorosfunded progressive advocacy group Media Matters for America headed by David Brock which has built a nonprofit cottage industry out of targeting conservatives in media and flagging their politically incorrect statements for coverage by mainstream media outlets Carusone is identified by insiders as the lead organizer of the pressure campaign to intimidate radio host Rush Limbaughs advertisers which accuses Limbaugh of bigotry Carusone joined Media Matters after founding the Stop Rush movement in late 2009 and effectively leading the Stop Beck campaign against Glenn Beck Since joining Media Matters Carusone spearheaded the Dump Trump campaign to pressure Macys to stop selling Donald Trumps products Then there was this headline in the DCxa0that emerged in 2017 BROCKBUSTER IS THE MEDIA MATTERS CHIEF SLURPING FROM A SLUSH FUND That jewel begins Media Matters chief David Brock has personally watched over and benefited from a scheme to hide donor identities that allowed progressives to funnel untraceable millions to initiatives against conservative and GOP causes around the nation a complaint filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission charges One could go on And on But the central fact is that it is past time for people across the media spectrum to stand up for free speech a free press and oppose these antifree press jihads that Media Matters and others in the Leftist State Media repeatedly mount from some troubled headquarters in a drive to intimidate or destroy outright both Fox News and any and all conservative hosts on television or radio Last year when the target was Laura Ingraham I wrote this column titled An Open Letter to Conservatives on Laura Ingraham Today quite literally the only thing needed is to substitute Tucker Carlson for Laura Ingraham The point stands I wrote in part By now it should be crystal clear to every conservative  no matter whether they are ProTrump Never Trump prothis or antithat  what is happening in America Any conservative on television or radio or in fact with any audience of any kind as in a speech invite to a college campus  is now a target for silencing Conservatives If I may direct this question to conservatives everywhere famous and unknown isnt it time to do something here The hard fact is this kind of what Ben Shapiro accurately calls fascism will continue until conservatives collectively rally and say Enough So Let me say it again This time  once more  the target is Tucker Carlson It is time More than past time for conservatives to stand up and say Enough n                                A personal note I know former President Donald Trump IRead More  n

53,"American Spectator, The",https://spectator.org/stephen-moore-and-herman-cain-are-just-what-the-fed-needs/,   President Trumps nomination of Stephen Moore and Herman Cain full disclosure both are friends and Moore an occasional professional colleague to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve has become something of axa0cause célèbrexa0in Washington Moores and Cains attackers outnumber their defenders But their defenders have the better argument The CainMoore mutiny of the Establishment is a perfect microcosm of the existential crisis of modernity Canadian public intellectual John Raltson Saul called this persistent existential crisis in his eponymous bookxa0Voltaires Bastards Penguin Books 1992 Thats shorthand for a misplaced veneration of reason Venerated reason has not performed nearly as well in practice as in theory Better call Saul The official Left would put most of our problems down to uncontrolled selfinterest as if they still had a clear idea of how to harness selfinterest for the general good The official Right would shrug its shoulders manfully that is to say cynically as if to imply that reality is tough But manful cynicism is probably a disguised form of confused helplessness And none of these contradictions have anything to do with reality  We are now more than four and a half centuries into an era which our obsession with progress and our servility to structure have caused us to name and rename a dozen times as if this flashing of theoretically fundamental concepts indicated real movement The reality is that we have not moved beyond the base ideas of the sixteenth century which for want of any better description should be called the concepts of reason This Age of Reason will soon have been with us for 500 years With each passing day more ideas structure and beliefs are hung upon the fragile back of these few concepts And yet even in their early days they were not ideas of great breadth Whats more from birth they were based upon an essential misunderstanding  that reason constituted a moral weapon when in fact it was nothing more than a disinterested administrative method That fundamental error may explain reasons continuing force because centuries of Western elites have been obliged to invent a moral direction where none existed Knowledge of course was to be the guarantee of reasons moral force  knowledge an invincible weapon which would ensure that society was built upon considered and sensible actions But in a world turned upon power through structure the disinterested consideration of knowledge simply couldnt hold and was rapidly transformed into our obsession with expertise The old civilization of class was replaced by one of castes  a highly sophisticated version of corporatism Knowledge became the currency of power and as such as retained This civilization of secretive experts was quite naturally obsessed not by the encouragement of understanding but by the providing of answers This obsession with the providing of answers calls to mind an infamous anecdote about Montagu Norman the first celebrity central banker as recalled in Jim Grants review ofxa0Till Times Last Sandxa0a history of the Bank of England from its founding in 1694 to the financially turbulent present We have appointed you as our economics adviser Montagu Norman the longestserving governor of the Bank of England said to a brainy new hire in the early 1930s Let me tell you that you are not here to tell us what to do but to explain to us why we have done it Here within the microcosm of Trumps announcement of Moore and Cain the Voltaires Bastards syndrome manifests in two main criticisms The first horrified indictment is that these candidates would undermine the independence of the Fed The second is that they lack sufficient academic qualifications for the job Neither criticism holds up under scrutiny The independence of the Fed is one of the most durable tropes in Washington It is also almost pure pretense As Steven Solomon wrote in The Confidence Game How Unelected Central Bankers Are Governing the Changed World Economy Simon  Schuster 1995 Although they strained to portray themselves as nonthreatening nonpartisan technicianmanagers of the status quo central bankers like proverbial Supreme Court justices reading election returns used their acute political antennae to intuit how far they could lean against the popular democratic winds Chairmen of the Federal Reserve observes exCitibank Chairman Walter Wriston have traditionally been the best politicians in Washington The Fed serves a wonderful function They get beat up on by the Congress and the administration Everyone knows the game and everyone plays it But no one wants their responsibility This claim of Fed independence has to cite Saul nothing to do with reality Its just a shibboleth of a misplaced veneration of what passes for rationality a rationality that has failed for a generation to contribute to sustained robust equitable prosperity When not in the grip of partisan frenzy the left the right and the center Wriston actually agree on this point As a centerleft commentator for thexa0Washington Postxa0Matt OBrien trenchantly wrote in Yes the Federal Reserve has enormous power over who is president The arc of the political universe is long but it bends towards monetary policy Thats the boring truth that nobody wants to hear Forget about the gaffes the horserace and even the personalities Elections are about the economy stupid and the economy is mostly controlled by monetary policy Thats why every big ideological turning point  1896 1920 1932 1980 and maybe 2008  has come after a big monetary shock Think about it this way Bad monetary policy means a bad economy which gives power back to the party that didnt have it before And so long as the monetary problem gets fixed the economy will too and the new governments policies will whatever their merits get the credit Thats how ideology changes Centerright John Tamny editor ofxa0Real Clear Markets argues that Presidents get the dollar they want Always At RCM The Carter and Bush presidencies werent certain failures as much as the dollar policies from both administrations ensured economic malaise Whats crucial is that all this could have been avoided Presidents get the dollar they want Always Will President Trump realize this before its too late A second knock on Moore and Cain is that they lack the professionalism requisite to serve To provide some context lets take a good look at the Feds own track record Ylan Q Mui then writing for thexa0Washington Postxa0wrote in Why nobody believes the Federal Reserves forecasts Even the governments official budget forecasters are dubious of the Feds own forecast This was a reprise of a note she had previously soundedIs the Feds crystal ball rosecolored The big question is whether Fed officials can get it right after years in which they have regularly predicted a stronger economy than the one that materialized The Feds economic predictions are consistently wrong Thus what can one really expect of policy based on those predictions It is not wrong of the president to express concern that monetary policy is too tight and strangling economic growth Mui was not merely exercising journalistic cheek In the New York Feds own flagship blog Liberty Street Economics we find  speaking for themselvesxa0and not the Fed  an admirably candid observation by an assistant vice president in the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks Research and Statistics Group Marco Del Negro Wharton PhD student Raiden Hasegawa and University of Pennsylvania professor of economics Frank Schorfheide Choosing the Right Policy in Real Time Why Thats Not Easy Model uncertainty is pervasive Economists bloggers policymakers all have different views of how the world works and what economic policies would make it better These views are like it or not models Some people spell them out in their entirety equations and all Others refuse to use the word altogether possibly out of fear of being falsified No model is right of course but some models are worse than others and we can have an idea of which is which by comparing their predictions with what actually happened  In the end we have shown that policy analysis in the very oversimplified world of DSGE models is a pretty difficult business Contrary to what it may sometimes appear from listening to talking heads deciding which policy is best is very rarely a slam dunk This can only be interpreted as an admission of the fundamental unreliability of the Feds core analytic Bravo for the dose of honest candor Prof Reuven Brenner has called our current system to account Macroeconomics is now astrologys modern incarnation Only instead of stars macroeconomists look at aggregates gathered religiously by governments statistical agencies  never mind if the country has a dictatorial regime be it left right or anything in between or has large black markets as Italy and Greece do where tax evasion has long been the main national sport So let us first forget about this macro stuff whose beginnings are almost a century old and offer a simple alternative for shedding light on the situation today and on possible solutions hopefully demolish this modern pseudoscience once and for all No less than Hayek in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech titled The Pretence of Knowledge acidly criticized the economics profession for something he called scientism meaning emulating the style but not the substance of the natural sciences The Fed with its many hundreds of PhD economists on staff is operating a pseudoscientific model This is thexa0sine qua nonxa0of the Voltaires Bastards syndrome Is there a problem with this pretense Jamie Dimon Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase recently went on record as proclaiming that the US economy should have grown 40 in the last decade not 20 The

54,"American Spectator, The",https://spectator.org/americas-left-and-the-confiscation-of-wealth/,   Americas conservatives should be those least amazed by our lefts calls for wealth confiscation The only surprise here is the flaunting After all wealth confiscation is what the left everywhere has always done Once in power it is the only way the lefts policies can survive As 2020 nears and the pursuit of increasingly restive radicals increases the politicians courting them aggressively seek more extreme positions The fear of the liberal label is long gone and the socialist sobriquet is all the rage among those who rage With the Marxist moniker come the policies Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations are already passé It is no longer enough to tax the wealthy more via their income Now the target is their wealth directly Calls for such blatantly confiscatory policies are still shocking to most Americans However as we have been repeatedly taught by the left globally such sensibilities are hopelessly out of step with the new progressivism In one sense Americas left is right in its calls The only shocking part is their explicit nature Usually Americas left does not admit it aims pursuing them instead silently The left pursues confiscatory policies not just because it supports them in its own right  though assuredly it does  but because it inevitably must The left always starts with enemies The question is how broadly it defines them and how stringently it pursues them The answer depends on the amount of power the left has Depending on place and parlance the lefts enemies range from the rich and corporations to capitalists the bourgeoisie and enemies of the state Confiscatory policies are aimed at them because in the words of the bank robber Willie Sutton thats where the money is Initially these strike a blow but they also stake the lefts expensive spending policies But the more the lefts policies are implemented the more they fall short If implemented broadly enough the economy itself falls short Regardless increased resources are needed to make up the shortfall The phenomenon is akin to the Laffer Curve albeit beyond tax revenue alone The economist Arthur Laffer described how increasing rates of taxation once they hit the inflection point actually result in declining tax revenue This creates the potential for reversal Cutting tax rates above their inflection point results in increased revenues This observation can be applied to the lefts policies in toto Entitlement programs continue to escalate  either through increasing benefits increasing utilization or both  until they become unaffordable requiring additional resources or rationing Subsidies become utilized until too costly and the product subsidized goes into short supply or is rationed Regulations mount to an extent that the activity regulated becomes less available or less desirable Given sufficient power the left can inflict this across an entire economy There is no shortage of examples of this happening in individual programs here and no shortage of this happening economywide abroad It is an economic tenet that resources are limited It is a political tenet that the lefts reach is unlimited The only way to square this circle is to take more through confiscation Of course even compulsion can swim only so long against the economic tide  as the drownings of so many socialist and communist countries prove The left has never been able to solve the question why those being increasingly confiscated from would indefinitely consent to producing more The overall effect is analogous to a farmer eating his seed corn Faced with a disappointing harvest instead of curtailing consumption the farmer decides to dip into the stock he should set aside for next years planting When spring comes he sows less and when harvest time comes his yield is even shorter Repeating the cycle each year falls shorter and shorter Eventually he has only enough to eat but none to plant So it is with the left It must make up its shortfall from others  confiscating what it lacks  until all fall short If this sounds preposterous look back to the lefts own past  the Soviet famine of 193233 and Communist Chinas Great Leap Forward  or simply look at its present in Venezuela and North Korea Or take its programs in isolation and see their inability to meet demand or be selfsufficient Without external subsidization they fail This is only new to America Here the lefts programs are subsidized from the general budget and the budget shortfall is borrowed Hidden from view there has been a quiet truce The left pursues its course in incremental steps accepts its subsidies and in return does not explicitly call for confiscation However Americas New Left reject this historical accommodation and its incrementalism Emboldened it seeks bigger prizes  a Green New Deal Medicare for All  and its needs and wants bigger prey Confiscatory policies are now explicit To the rest of the world  particularly those who have endured the left  such confiscatory calls are all too familiar Far from new and novel they are very old indeed  both chronologically and in the sense of being worn out They trace back to the 19thcentury and were tried repeatedly in the last century Each time they were miserable failures  literally  leaving those subjected to them in misery Far from being progressive  todays trendy attempt at rebranding  they are actually regressive These policies are throwbacks in time just as they are throwaways philosophically economically and politically America has not known this in the sense of living it Knowing it intellectually that it actually occurred elsewhere is not the same To Americas collective mind it has remained a foreign affliction  like leprosy or the plague  that does not cannot actually occur here Americas only real encounter has been the momentary quadrennial contact with some crank running for president as a communist or socialist At best such candidates pick up a comparative handful of votes and curiosity They are the crazy aunt who mercifully shows up only for major family gatherings Only this time she has brought friends We have emotionally felt that socialism and its wealth confiscation could not happen here It can of course These policies now being so candidly bandied about are exactly what it would look like And these proposals are just the beginning of what the left will do if given the chance JT Young served under President George W Bush as the director of communications in the Office of

55,"American Spectator, The",https://spectator.org/the-dems-will-lose-the-house-in-2020/,   If you find it difficult to grasp how a handful of leftwing extremists managed to win last weeks battle with the nominal leadership of the Democratic Party over a House resolution originally written to condemn antiSemitism Margaret Thatcher explained the phenomenon four decades ago The one thing about leftwing politicians is that they are always fanatical They never let go Its their religion She was describing how the Labour Party had been destroyed from within by a small minority of radicals Thatcher eventually exploited this process led the Conservative Party to victory over Labour and became Prime Minister for eleven years The Republicans will deliver a similarly humiliating defeat to House Democrats in 2020 if its alleged leaders fail to rein in their own cadre of fanatical leftists the core of which consists of recently elected social justice warriors Alexandria OcasioCortez Ilhan Omar Rashida Tlaib Ayanna Pressley Rohit Khanna Raul Grijalva and Pramila Jayapal But the internecine fight that preceded the cowardly revision of the antiSemitism resolution into a denunciation of generic bigotry suggests that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer may not hold enough sway over their own caucus to prevent it from selfdestructing Before their epic defeat in 1994 the Democrats held the House majority for no fewer than four decades Yet after 12 years in the wilderness they clearly had learned nothing After finally winning it back again in 2006 their irresponsible antics condemned them to the minority after only four years If they pursue their current agenda for the next 18 months they will be in the minority again after only two years Not only can they not muster a majority to condemn antiSemitism their most visible members are unabashedly embracing socialism and the first piece of major legislation HR1 literally gives illegal immigrants the vote The Democrat majority jammed that bill ironically titled For the People Act of 2019 through last Friday At a time when the voters say immigration is the most important issue facing the nation this pernicious bill actually loosens restrictions on voting by illegal aliens The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996theoretically prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections but HR1 permits them to vote in local contests such as school board elections The GOP attempted to amend the bill so that only US citizens can vote The Democrats rejected this of course as Rep Dan Crenshaw RTX tweeted Today I offered a motion to recommit HR1 reaffirming that only US citizens should have the right to vote Dems rejected it Next time you go to the ballot box keep that in mind The future of their party is in cities like San Fran where illegals can vote Let that sink in It goes without saying that HR1 is a classic Democrat power grab that attempts to usurp the authority of the states to regulate the voter registration process It would vitiate the accuracy of registration rolls by automatically registering anyone who acquires a drivers license prevent election officials from verifying voter eligibility and render state voter ID laws null and void HR1 also takes the power to draw congressional districts away from the states and requires inclusion of illegal aliens in all redistricting plans Moreover it violates the 1st Amendment so brazenly that even the American Civil Liberties Union bestirred itself The American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of its 3 million members supporters and activists opposes HR1 We strongly urge the Rules Committee to allow floor amendments that would mitigate our concerns with the provisions that unconstitutionally infringe the freedoms of speech and association Having thus used HR1 to unconstitutionally seize control over our elections and presumably using that power to create a permanent majority in Congress as well as a series of compliant presidents then the Democrats would get down to implementing their socialist agenda in earnest First on the list will of course be the singlepayer health care system for which they have yearned for so long Dubbed Medicare for All it will eliminate all private and employer health plans and come with an annual price tag of 33 trillion It will allegedly save us money pursuant to lower administrative costs Yet even the Washington Post confesses The public piece of the American healthcare system has not proven itself to be particularly costefficient On a per capita basis US government health programs alone spend more than Canada Australia France and Britain expanding Medicare to all would not automatically result in a radically more efficient healthcare system Not coincidentally the latest version of this pieinthesky plan was introduced in late February by one of the abovenamed Social Justice Warriors Pramila Jayapal It boasts 100 Democrat cosponsors and a number of Democratic presidential candidates have embraced the plan including Senators Cory Booker Kirsten Gillibrand Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren The only Democrat who has shown reticence about a fullthroated endorsement is Amy Klobuchar who describes Medicare for All as an aspiration rather than an addwaterandstir cure for what ails US health care This is also how she talks about the absurd Green New Deal This brings us back to our six Social Justice Warriors The Green New Deal is not as most people seem to think a plan conceived by Alexandria OcasioCortez and her staff to save the planet It is in fact a program concocted by the Justice Democrats the main PAC that supported the divine AOC and the other five SJWs listed above One of its founders was none other than Saikat Chakrabarti AOCs chief of staff who is facing scrutiny by the Federal Election Commission pursuant to a lot of dark money that has been sloshing around between the Justice Democrats PAC and a Chakrabarticontrolled LLC called Brand New Congress Republicans will welcome confirmation that AOC et al who have been so vocal about the political influence of the Jewish lobby are just a new generation of Democrat grifters That revelation will be considerably less satisfying to Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the partys leadership In 2020 the GOP will target 50 to 60 seats held by Democrats in purple districts they narrowly won during the last two cycles Most of those seats will flip after AOC and her fellow travelers drag the party to the far left The voters will associate the Democrats with antiSemitism socialism and illegal immigration and they will lose the House majority again n                                A personal note I know former President Donald Trump IRead

59,"American Spectator, The",https://spectator.org/the-day-of-reckoning-is-at-hand/,   This week before the Senate Appropriations Committee Attorney General William Barr gave testimony that is guaranteed to induce panic throughout the DC swamp Regarding spying on Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign he testified as follows ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR As I said in my confirmation hearing I am going to be reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign during 2016 And a lot of this has already been investigated and a substantial portion of it has been investigated and is being investigated by the office of the Inspector General but one of the things I want to do is pull everything together from the various investigations that have gone on including on the Hill and in the Justice Department and see if there are any remaining questions to be addressed SEN JEANNE SHAHEEN D NHxa0And can you share with us why you feel a need to do that BARR Well you know for the same reason were worried about foreign influence in elections we want to make sure that during elections  I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal Its a big deal The generation I grew up in which is the Vietnam War period people were all concerned about spying on antiwar people and so forth by the government and there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that theres an adequate basis before our law enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance Im not suggesting that those rules were violated but I think its important to look at that and Im not talking about the FBI necessarily but intelligence agencies more broadly SHAHEEN So youre not suggesting though that spying occurred BARR Well I guess  I think spying did occur yes I think spying did occur SHAHEEN Well  BARR The question was whether it was adequately predicated And Im not suggesting it wasnt adequately predicated I need to explore that I think its my obligation Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane I want to make sure that happened We have a lot of rules about that I want to say that Ive said Im reviewing this I havent set up a team yet but I have in mind having some colleagues help me pull all this information together and letting me know whether there are some areas that should be looked at I also want to make clear I also want to make clear this is not launching an investigation of the FBI Frankly to the extent there were any issues at the FBI I do not view it as a problem thats endemic to the FBI I think there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon So I dont like to hear attacks about the FBI because I think the FBI is an outstanding organization and I think Chris Wray is a great partner for me Im very pleased hes there as the director If it becomes necessary to look over some former officials activities I expect Ill be relying heavily on Chris and work closely with him in looking at that information But thats what Im doing I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused I think thats one of the principal roles of the Attorney General Coming from Barr a most measured and serious man this explosive testimony portends a bleak future for all those FBI Department of Justice and intelligence community operatives who used their official positions and enormous  bordering on limitless  governmental powers to undermine the presidential campaign of Donald Trump and failing that to undo the results of the 2016 election So it is that Barrs description of the possibility of such political surveillance as a big deal is understatement of the first order As big deals go the stakes couldnt be any higher On cue the Democrats and their wholly owned mainstream media subsidiary have tried to dull the impact of Barrs testimony One bedraggled party flak claimed on network television that since Barr merelyxa0thoughtxa0spying had occurred he had not confirmed that it had really truly and actually happened And resorting to the lefts default position on all things Trumpxa0Washington Postxa0columnist Jennifer Rubin has called for Barrs impeachment These unhinged responses to Barrs testimony are similar to the type of desperate fantasybased gibberish you might expect from a barricaded man facing imminent death at the hands of a SWAT team Clearly the left knows that with Barr running the show trouble is on the way Although Barr tried to avoid making any definitive statements about the ultimate outcome of the current and future investigations he did let slip certain tidbits that should cause many sleepless nights throughout what we in the Justice Department used to call the Seat of Government In that regard Barr effectively stated that the investigation would be to determine whether the Obama administration had engaged in electronic surveillance of the opposing political partys presidential campaign and candidate without a proper legal basis When Barr questioned whether the spying on the Trump campaign was adequately predicated he was obviously talking about the unverified and salacious Steele dossier that was used to obtain FISA warrants to intercept the communications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page Such an investigation will necessarily encompass the genesis of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaigns boughtandpaidfor opposition research that constitutes the basis of the dossier and its knowing dishonest and illegal use by James Comeys FBI and Loretta Lynchs Department of Justice to deceive the FISA court into authorizing the electronic surveillance of Page and by extension all of the persons in or out of the Trump campaign with whom he communicated As we now know in sworn testimony given in the United Kingdom not even Christopher Steele would vouch for the dossiers accuracy And equally damaging in testimony before Congress FBI lawyer Lisa Page stated that contrary to standard FBI procedure in counterintelligence operations the Trump campaign purportedly the target of Russian infiltration had not been warned of the Kremlins nefarious efforts because the FBI did not deem the Steele dossier reliable enough to compel such a warning Pages testimony sets up an irresistible line of inquiry If the dossier was not reliable enough to justify a warning to Trumps campaign about the Kremlins plot how could it even remotely serve as the basis for obtaining FISA warrants to spy on the campaign By her benighted testimony Page has framed the issue nicely and invited a full vetting of who what where when why and how the dossier was used to dupe the FISA court Barr also made clear that beyond the FBI and Justice Department the investigation will also be looking at intelligence agencies This makes sense given that low level Trump campaign associates such as George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis were approached by foreign operatives with CIA ties in an effort to plant the seeds of the TrumpRussia collusion illusion As for the FBI Barr made clear that while he does not think that there is an endemic problem at that agency he thinks that there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon No kidding And of course any investigation into the spying must logically and inexorably lead to the clandestine statesponsored plot to unwind the 2016 election and remove President Trump from office In short the subject matter of any proper investigation will necessarily encompass the first attempted coup détat in our nations history So here we are After suffering through Attorney General Jeff Sessions comatose stewardship of the Justice Department Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosensteins underhanded machinations and Special Counsel Robert Muellers protracted rear guard action to protect the antiTrump deep state conspirators the day of reckoning is at hand Attorney General Barrs testimony portends a long overdue cleansing of the government temple the likes of which has never before happened in this country This will be history in the making In ancient times when nations reached such dramatic inflection points there were poets authors artists and philosophers who formulated explained and preserved for posterity the meaning of events and their impact upon their societies As I listened to Barrs astounding testimony I realized that America was at such an historic milestone Who I mused will step forward to explicate and place these momentous events into their proper context Does America have a Homer or a Cicero to properly express the gratitude and exaltation of our fellow citizens at the approach of long desired and overdue justice And then the answer suddenly came to me as my shrinking brain flashed back to the immortal words of that long ago anthem of righteous adolescent retribution My Boyfriends Back to wit My boyfriends back and youre gonna be in troublenHeyladayla my boyfriends backnYou see him comin better cut out on the doublenHeyladayla my boyfriends back Heres a link to The Angels singing My Boyfriends Backxa0on the Ed Sullivan Show Their performance is at once entertaining and seemingly prescient As you watch them sing imagine that they are making eye contact with James Comey Rod Rosenstein Andrew McCabe Peter Strzok John Brennan Bruce Ohr Lisa Page Sally Yates Glenn Simpson Christopher Steele and all the rest of the conspirators Its pretty amusing To a remarkable degree the lyrics are apt and convey the mood of all of us who have had a belly full of the deep state As for all of those swamp dwellers who have corrupted and degraded our government to this historical low point let me paraphrase the best line in the song If I were them Id take a permanent vacation Where at Club Fed If Barr means what he says you can count on it George Parry is a former federal and state prosecutor who practices law in

nuclear summit with a oneonone discussion and an intimate dinner as hard questions swirl about what the American president will demand and Pyongyang might be willing to give up The two leaders and their aides encamped in Hanoi after long journeys by plane train and automobile  Trump on Air Force One Kim in an armored railcar and limousine  for two days of talks addressing perhaps the worlds biggest security challenge Kims nuclear program that stands on the verge of realistically threatening targets around the planet Although many experts are skeptical Kim will give up the nuclear weapons he likely sees as his best guarantee of continued rule there was a palpable carnivallike excitement among many in Hanoi as final preparations were made for Wednesdays summit opening There were also huge traffic jams in the already congested streets Trump was opening his visit in morning meetings with Vietnams president and prime minister before turning his attention to Kim Official greetings with the normally reclusive leader will give way to a short oneonone discussion before whats being described as a social dinner with an exclusive guest list The White House said Trump will be joined at the dinner by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney Kim too will have two aides with him and there will be translators for each side Trump and Kim will have a series of additional official meetings Thursday Kim who arrived in Hanoi first spent Tuesday traveling around the Vietnamese capital in his limousine With a squad of bodyguards in tow he visited sections of Hanoi including his nations embassy where a loud cheer went up as he entered the compound As host Vietnam is eager to show off its huge economic and development improvements since the destruction of the Vietnam War But the country also tolerates no dissent and is able to provide the kind of firm hand not allowed by more democratic potential hosts Trump arrived late Tuesday after a 20hour trip that included refueling stops in England and Qatar He shook hands with dignitaries on a red carpet flanked by Vietnamese troops in crisp white uniforms The route to his hotel was decorated with American North Korean and Vietnamese flags and adults and children peered out upperfloor windows holding up cellphones to capture his arrival Tremendous crowds and so much love the US president tweeted Kims journey to the summit though shorter in distance was even more protracted He took a nearly 70hour train ride through southern China and then traveled from a Vietnamese border town in his limousine Hours ahead of his border crossing at Dong Dang footage from Japanese TV network TBS showed Kim taking a predawn smoke break at a train station in China A woman who appeared to be his sister Kim Yo Jong held a crystal ashtray at the ready In Hanoi soldiers police and international journalists thronged the streets outside Kims hotel and hundreds of eager citizens stood behind barricades hoping to see the North Korean leader As flags from the three countries fluttered in a chilly drizzle dozens of cameras flashed and some citizens screamed and used their mobile phones to capture Kims arrival I like him local resident Van Dang Luu who works at a nearby bank said of Kim He is very young and he is very interesting And he is very powerful she said Trump is not young but I think he is very powerful The leaders first met last June in Singapore a summit that was long on historic pageantry but short on any enforceable agreements for North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal North Korea has spent decades at great economic sacrifice building its nuclear program and there is widespread skepticism that it will give away that program cheaply Trump laid out ultimate goals for both the US and Kim before leaving Washington We want denuclearization and I think hell have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy He has praised Pyongyang for ceasing missile tests and has appeared to ease up on demanding a timeline for disarmament Kim is seeking relief from crushing US sanctions Even as he tamped down expectations that hell achieve big strides toward denuclearization Trump was still eager to claim an attentiongrabbing victory to offset the political turmoil he faces at home With the president out of the country his former personal lawyer was testifying on Capitol Hill on Tuesday about alleged misconduct by Trump the House was expected to approve legislation aimed at blocking Trump from steering billions of extra dollars to his Southwest border wall and a House committee voted to subpoena administration officials over family separations at the border  AP journalists Yves Dam Van in Dong Dang Hyungjin Kim Adam

65,AP,https://apnews.com/07c68ddd6a304e7ca6b020c2b9deb052,COEBURN Va AP  Former coal miner John Robinsons bills for black lung treatments run 4000 a month but the federal fund he depends on to help cover them is being drained of money because of inaction by Congress and the Trump administration Amid the turmoil of the government shutdown this winter a tax on coal that helps pay for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was cut sharply Jan 1 and never restored potentially saving coal operators hundreds of millions of dollars a year With cash trickling into the fund at less than half its usual rate budget officials estimate that by the middle of 2020 there wont be enough money to fully cover the funds benefit payments As a surge of black lung disease scars miners lungs at younger ages than ever Robinson worries not only about cuts to his benefits but that younger miners wont get any coverage Coal miners sort of been put on the back burner thrown to the side Robinson said recently sitting at his kitchen table in the small Virginia town of Coeburn near the Kentucky border They just aint being done right President Donald Trump who vowed to save the coal industry during the 2016 campaign has repeatedly praised miners At an August rally in West Virginia filled with miners in hard hats he called them great people Brave people I dont know how the hell you do that You guys have a lot of courage Trump made no mention of restoring the 2018 tax rate in his proposed budget released in midMarch The White House said in a statement Tuesday that President Trump and this administration have always supported the mining industry by prioritizing deregulation and less Washington interference Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell whose home state of Kentucky is third in the nation in coal production told a reporter from Ohio Valley ReSource in October the tax rate would be taken care of before we get into an expiration situation That didnt happen McConnell spokesman Robert Steurer didnt repeat that pledge this week rather he wrote in an email benefits provided through the Black Lung Disability Fund continue to be provided at regular levels and that McConnell continues to prioritize maintaining and protecting the benefits Trump and McConnell have reaped large contributions from the coal industry according to the political money website Open Secrets Trump received more than 276000 during the 2016 presidential election from political action committees and individuals affiliated with coal companies His inaugural committee received 1 million from Joe Craft CEO of Alliance Resource Partners in Tulsa Oklahoma and 300000 from the Murray Energy Corporation the nations largest privatelyowned coalmining company McConnell received more than 297000 in coal industry donations since 2014 when he was last up for election Congress established the trust fund in 1978 Until the rate expired money came from an excise tax of 110 per ton on underground coal and 55 cents on surfacemined coal that brought in 450 million last year Rates fell to about 50 cents and 25 cents when lawmakers failed to act on its Dec 31 expiration date The fund provides health benefits and payments to about 25000 retired miners Most worked for companies that are now bankrupt Many including Robinson struggle to breathe as their lungs are slowly stifled by tiny dust and particles trapped there Robinson was 47 when he was diagnosed part of a wave of younger miners that doctors and experts say have been swept up in a new black lung epidemic in Appalachia Robinson now 53 and others who depend on the fund are disappointed in McConnell and other leaders who typically enjoy miners support I just feel that Mitch McConnell has let the citizens of Kentucky down especially the miners said Patty Amburgey whose husband Crawford died of black lung disease at age 62 in 2007 She draws a monthly widows payment through his black lung disability benefits And now theres an epidemic of black lung Dr Brandon Crum has watched that epidemic unfold at his Pikeville Kentucky radiology clinic In less than four years Crum has seen 200 miners diagnosed with a severe form of black lung disease called pulmonary massive fibrosis The nation had 31 such diagnoses in the 1990s according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Were looking at men in their 30s and 40s on oxygen being evaluated for lung transplants Crum said Those are usually middleage individuals with younger families so it affects their wives a lot His findings were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a December 2016 report that showed a shockingly high level of severe black lung cases at his clinic Amburgey of Letcher County Kentucky said there will be fewer benefits for the growing number of younger miners with black lung if the fund is depleted Robinson said hes now worried the trust funds pot of money will dry up West Virginia Sen Joe Manchin and other coalstate Democratic senators are pushing a bill to shore up the fund by restoring the larger tax for 10 years Manchin said in a statement that lawmakers cannot continue to allow these solutions to be put off again and again That bill is in a Senate finance committee The mining industry supported the increased tax rates expiration calling the effort to maintain it an unnecessary tax increase The National Mining Association which speaks for the industry says the lower rate will be sufficient to cover monthly benefit costs for the fund The group argued extending the rate would lead to job losses The May 2018 GAO report contradicts that claim saying the funds beneficiaries could multiply due to the increased occurrence of black lung disease and its most severe form progressive massive fibrosis particularly among Appalachian coal miners The increase in younger black lung sufferers will put more pressure on the fund as the industry continues to shrink I think people always thought they would get black lung if they worked long enough in the mines but I think its a disease they thought would affect them at the end of their life in their 70s or 80s Crum said Amburgey says Trump reneged on his pledge to support miners Mr Trump promised that he would bring the mines back and take care of the miners and that is not happening she said He promised us a snowball in July  Follow

67,AP,https://apnews.com/a56660acd9b740658a83fba373cbfae1,WASHINGTON AP  As the nation awaits the release of the special counsels report Thursday a new poll finds that many Americans arent ready to clear President Donald Trump in the Russia investigation Slightly more Americans want Congress to keep investigating than to set aside its probes after special counsel Robert Mueller left open the question of whether Trump broke the law About 6 in 10 continue to believe the president obstructed justice The poll by The Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research also finds greater GOP confidence in the investigation after Attorney General William Barr in late March released his letter saying Mueller found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia but didnt make a judgment on the obstruction question At the same time the poll indicates that Americans are mostly unhappy with the amount of information that has been released so far Theyll get more Thursday  when Barr is expected to release a redacted version of the nearly 400page report Trump has repeatedly claimed total exoneration after Barr asserted in his memo that there was insufficient evidence for an obstruction prosecution Its a total phony Trump said of all allegations to Minneapolis TV station KSTP this week Any aspect of that report I hope it does come out because there was no collusion whatsoever no collusion There was no obstruction because that was ruled by the attorney general Overall 39 of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president roughly unchanged from midMarch before Mueller completed his twoyear investigation But many Americans still have questions Its kind of hard to believe what the president says as far as exoneration said James Brown 77 of Philadelphia who doesnt affiliate with either party but says his political views lean conservative And in my mind the attorney general is a Trump person so hes not going to do anything against Trump The poll shows 35 of Americans think that Trump did something illegal related to Russia  largely unchanged since the earlier poll An additional 34 think hes done something unethical Brown says he remains extremely concerned about possible inappropriate contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia citing Trumps past interest in building a Trump Tower in Moscow and believes the president committed crimes of obstruction to cover up financial interests Hes not going to jeopardize his pocketbook for anything he said Still the poll suggests Barrs summary helped allay some lingering doubts within the GOP Among Republicans more now say Trump did nothing wrong at all 65 vs 55 a month ago and fewer say he did something unethical 27 down from 37 a month ago Glen Sebring 56 of Chico California says he thinks the nation should put the Russia investigations to rest after reading Barrs fourpage summary of the Mueller report The moderate Republican credits Trump with helping double the money hes now earning because of an improving economy and says Congress should spend more time on issues such as lowering health care costs Its like beating a dead horse Sebring said Weve got a lot more important things to worry about Even as Trump blasts the Mueller probe as a Democratic witch hunt poll respondents expressed more confidence that the investigation was impartial The growing confidence since March was driven by Republicans Threequarters now say they are at least moderately confident in the probe and 38 are very or extremely confident up from 46 and 18 respectively in March Among Democrats about 70 are at least moderately confident down slightly from a month ago and 45 are very or extremely confident Still 61 of Americans say they believe the Justice Department has shared too few details so far with the public and 55 think it has shared too few with Congress About a third think the department has shared too little with the White House which has argued that portions of the report should be kept confidential if they involve private conversations of the president subject to executive privilege Democrats have been calling for Mueller himself to testify before Congress and have expressed concern that Barr will order unnecessary censoring of the report to protect Trump The House Judiciary Committee led by Rep Jerrold Nadler of New York is poised to try to compel Barr to turn over an unredacted copy as well as the reports underlying investigative files The poll shows that even with the Mueller probe complete 53 say Congress should continue to investigate Trumps ties with Russia while 45 say Congress should not A similar percentage 53 say Congress should take steps to impeach Trump if he is found to have obstructed justice even if he did not have inappropriate contacts with Russia We dont even know what we found yet in the probe Until we do Congress should definitely continue to push this issue said Tina Perales a 35year old smallbusiness owner in Norton Ohio who describes herself as Republican That little letter Barr sent out summarizing the report I think was completely BS This Mueller thing is hundreds of pages and he just sums it up like this These things just dont add up Deep partisan divisions remain Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to believe Trump had done something improper and to support continued investigations that could lead to his removal from office House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif has downplayed the likelihood of impeachment proceedings but isnt closing the door entirely if there are significant findings of Trump misconduct On investigations 84 of Democrats believe lawmakers shouldnt let up in scrutinizing Trumps ties to Russia but the same share of Republicans disagrees Similarly 83 of Democrats say Congress should take steps to impeach Trump if he is found to have obstructed justice even if he did not have inappropriate contacts with Russia while 82 of Republicans say Congress should not  The

69,AP,https://apnews.com/9904e6efcba64f7d8343df39e9faabdb,GLENWOOD Iowa AP  The federal agency that manages dams along the Missouri River received stern criticism from several US senators Wednesday during a hearing held in Iowa to examine the massive spring flooding this year that caused more than 3 billion in damage in the Midwest The flooding and actions taken by the US Army Corps of Engineers which has been bitterly criticized in the wake of the flooding are the focus of the US Senate hearing Critics have demanded that the agency make flood control its top priority though Congress would have to act to change the Corps priorities Iowa Republican Sen Joni Ernst said flooding shouldnt be such a regular occurrence along the Missouri River saying The trend of flood and rebuild flood and rebuild must end Democratic Sen Kirsten Gillibrand added that the Corps should be more aggressive in preventing flood damage and consider the effects of climate change They are too slow too bureaucratic and they dont have enough money said Gillibrand who is running for president and was in Iowa touring flood damage She took part in the hearing because she serves on the committee that oversees the Corps The sentiments may be appealing in Midwestern states that have endured flooding along rivers that the Corps is charged with managing but they may not be as popular with supporters of other approved uses of the river such as protecting endangered species and navigation The Corps John Remus said the agency works to balance all the uses of the river and maximize the benefit to several when possible But flood control is the main concern anytime flooding is imminent along the Missouri River The number one priority of the Corps in its operations is life and public safety Remus said The Corps has also said that much of the water that caused the Midwest flooding in March came from rain and melting snow that flowed into the Missouri River downstream of all the dams it controls At the same time massive amounts of water was filling the reservoirs and some had to be released Farmer Leo Ettleman said the Corps should have made significant changes to its operating manual after the historic 2011 floods but neither the Corps nor Congress took action Ettlemen said the kind of flooding the area saw this spring will continue unless changes are made In the past eight years Congress has done little or nothing except to offer prayers and thoughts which are appreciated but wont fix the problem said Ettleman who farms near Percival Iowa and joined a lawsuit against the Corps after the 2011 flood Missouri Farm Bureau President Blake Hurst farms near the Missouri River He said the lessons from this years flooding should lead to changes about where levees are built and how the river is managed When flood recovery is complete we will have failed if every structure is the same as it was and if the management of the river has not changed Hurst said To do the same things and expect better results is the triumph of hope over experience Mike Peluso a longtime professional fisherman who runs an outdoors and guide service in North Dakota said he doesnt want to see management of the river swayed one way or the other for political reasons They are more populated down south I get that he said But its the same river regardless of whether or not youve got a million people or 100000 people It needs to be managed from the top down He added I have a hard time believing with all the technology and brainpower we have we cant find a balance there between flood protection and other interests like recreation Greg Power fisheries division chief for the North Dakota Game and Fish Department said he believes the Corps does a pretty good job of managing the Missouri River system Flood control is still a high priority within the Corps I know that Power said Some of these water years are pretty incredible themselves and I would hate to be a Corps person to be honest Rep Sam Graves whose district includes the northwestern Missouri area ravaged by flooding in March introduced a bill this month that would remove fish and wildlife as an authorized management priority on the Missouri River and make flood control the highest priority The bill would require revision of the Missouri River Master Manuel within 90 days of enactment Time and again we continue to see fish and birds take precedence over people and property when it comes to managing the Missouri River Graves a Republican said in a statement This latest round of flooding has devastated communities up and down the river We already know that the management practices are contributing to it Area politicians have said repeatedly since the flood that flood control should be the Corps top priority Robert Criss a professor at Washington University in St Louis who has been studying flooding for more than two decades said there may be a more important factor than how the Corps priorities are ranked The Missouri River has been made narrower over the years Criss said and the Corps has worked to maintain a defined channel for barge traffic even though few barges ever cross the river near Iowa and Nebraska Were having this problem because we messed with the rivers too much Criss said  Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St Louis and Dave Kolpack in Fargo North Dakota

70,AP,https://apnews.com/0fa9971e62114304a5e04358158bce8f,WASHINGTON AP  President Donald Trumps former personal lawyer is preparing to tell a House committee Wednesday that Trump knew ahead of time that WikiLeaks had emails damaging to his rival Hillary Clintons presidential campaign and that he is a racist a conman and a cheat Michael Cohen suggests in prepared testimony obtained by The Associated Press that Trump also implicitly told him to lie about a Moscow real estate project Cohen has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the project which he says Trump knew about as Cohen was negotiating with Russia during the election Cohen says Trump did not directly tell him to lie but that he would look me in the eye and tell me theres no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing Cohen said that in his way he was telling me to lie In the testimony Cohen apologizes for his actions and says I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr Trumps illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience On WikiLeaks Cohen says he was in Trumps office in July 2016 when his longtime adviser Roger Stone called Trump He says Trump put Stone on speakerphone and Stone said that within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clintons campaign Trump responded by saying wouldnt that be great according to Cohen A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time Cohen says in the testimony The answer is yes Cohen also says that Trump made racist comments about AfricanAmericans saying at one point that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid Cohen says that he and Trump once drove through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago and that Trump remarked that only black people could live that way He also says Trump once asked him to name a country run by a black person that wasnt falling apart though he says Trump used a vulgarism At the time Barack Obama was Americas president Looking ahead to his public testimony Cohen said Tuesday that the American people can decide exactly who is telling the truth when he appears Wednesday before the House Oversight and Reform committee setting the stage for an explosive public hearing that threatens to overshadow Trumps summit in Vietnam with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Cohen once Trumps loyal attorney and fixer has turned on his former boss and cooperated with special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation He begins a threeyear prison sentence in May after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in 2017 and committing campaign finance violations while he was working for Trump He met with the Senate intelligence committee for more than nine hours behind closed doors on Tuesday Cohen said he appreciated the opportunity to clear the record and tell the truth after acknowledging he lied to the committee  in 2017 It was the first of three consecutive days of congressional appearances for Cohen After the public hearing Wednesday he will appear before the House intelligence panel Thursday again speaking in private Republicans are expected to aggressively attempt to discredit Cohen given that he has acknowledged lying previously White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement Tuesday it was laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies One Republican House member did more than just question Cohens credibility Florida Republican Matt Gaetz tweeted Tuesday that the world is about to learn a lot about Cohen and suggested he knew of disparaging information that could come out during the hearing The Trump ally offered no evidence to support his remarks and waved off the notion that he appeared to be threatening or intimidating a witness After a barrage of criticism Gaetz apologized and said he was deleting the tweet and should have chosen better words to show his intent Lanny Davis one of Cohens lawyers said in a statement that he wouldnt respond to Gaetzs despicable lies and personal smears except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House both Republicans and Democrats will repudiate his words and his conduct Democrats have been alternately suspicious of Cohen and eager to hear what he has to say Sen Mark Warner the intelligence panels top Democrat suggested in a brief statement to reporters outside Tuesdays interview that Cohen had provided important information Two years ago when this investigation started I said it may be the most important thing I am involved in in my public life in the Senate and nothing Ive heard today dissuades me from that view Warner said In addition to lying to Congress Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations for his involvement in payments to two women who allege they had affairs with Trump Federal prosecutors in New York have said Trump directed Cohen to arrange the payments to buy the silence of porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the runup to the 2016 campaign Cohen told a judge that he agreed to cover up Trumps dirty deeds out of blind loyalty In his prepared testimony Cohen says he will present the committee with a copy of the check Trump wrote from his personal bank account after he became president to reimburse him for the hush money payments Trump has denied the allegations and said Cohen lied to get a lighter sentence Cohen is not expected to discuss matters related to Russia in the public hearing saving that information for the closeddoor interviews with the intelligence committees House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings has said he doesnt want to interfere with Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and links to Trumps campaign Members of the Oversight panel are expected to ask questions about the campaign finance violations Trumps business practices and compliance with tax laws and the accuracy of the presidents public statements

refuge for the newly homeless 40 Venezuelan soldiers who abandoned their posts and ran for their lives The young National Guard troops sleep on thin mats on the floor In one room several flak jackets rest along a wall On a balcony boots that got wet crossing the muddy Tachira River are set out to dry I was tired of people seeing me as just one more of them Sgt Jorge Torres said referring to President Nicolas Maduros socialist government Im not A highstakes plan by the Venezuelan opposition to bring humanitarian aid into the country floundered Saturday when troops loyal to Maduro refused to let the trucks carrying food and medical supplies cross but it did set off a wave of military defections unlike any seen yet amid the countrys mounting crisis Over 320 mostly lowranking soldiers fled in a span of four days Colombian immigration officials said Tuesday With no relatives in Colombia several dozen have ended up in a shelter run by a priest The home on a street with lowhanging electrical wires is where they are nervously keeping track of relatives left behind figuring out how to apply for asylum and deciding what should come next The only way for this government to leave unfortunately and all of Venezuela knows it is for there to be a direct intervention said Sgt Jose Gomez a father of two The only one with that power is the international community In interviews with The Associated Press nine National Guard soldiers described the day that they were ordered by commanders to stop the humanitarian aid from entering Venezuela Fearful of being jailed many complied with orders and admitted to launching tear gas at protesters Two said they were part of a failed plot to get the aid in All fled after making unplanned splitsecond decisions with only the uniform on their backs Son if this decision is to save your life and so that there is change do it Gomez said his father told him in a brief phone call before he sprinted across the border The defections come as the Venezuelan opposition puts pressure on the military to recognize congress leader Juan Guaido as the nations rightful president Venezuelas military has served as the traditional arbiter of political disputes forcing out dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez in 1958 But the top military brass has stood fast with Maduro who has shown no sign that he intends to relinquish power While Guaido has proposed amnesty to military officers who back him the lowranking soldiers who have defected say breaking ranks with Maduro is all but impossible Even as the number fleeing swells they represent a small percentage of the at least 200000 troops in Venezuelas army Anyone who shows the slightest hint of disapproval risks arrest they said and jail has become increasingly synonymous with torture Even those like Gomez who wanted to see the aid brought in followed orders to repress citizens As Saturday grew increasingly tense protesters threw rocks and gasoline bombs at him He said he responded by throwing tear gas at them to protect himself Others at the home also had evidence of the resistance they faced that day Torres still had blood caked beneath the skin on his nose from protesters kicking him on the ground after he surrendered to Colombian authorities A young woman had a scratch across her cheek that she said came from a rock thrown by protesters During the clashes armed proMaduro groups known as colectivos fired indiscriminately and several of the soldiers said they feared being shot themselves National Guard troops are equipped with crowdcontrol devices like rubber bullets and tear gas but do not carry any regular firearms Like the rest of the population struggling against hyperinflation expected to reach an eyeboggling 10 million percent this year the soldiers also knew the indignities of life in Venezuela where severe shortages of food and medicine have led to more than 3 million people leaving the country in recent years You know that in your own home you dont even have a kilo of rice said the female soldier who requested anonymity fearing for the safety of the children she left back home And Im supposed to stay here fighting why Two months ago Gomez said he watched as his newborn son died within 15 minutes because the hospital where his wife delivered did not have oxygen to pump into his failing lungs Torres said an aunt died of cancer and an uncle succumbed to a curable stomach infection Thats what pushed me to make this decision Torres said When Guaido first announced the aid push Torres said that he and three soldiers in his barracks huddled and quietly discussed their options As National Guard drivers they had access to armored trucks They hatched a plan to drive the vehicles across the Simon Bolivar International Bridge breaking down the barricades that stood in the way and allowing opposition trucks to carry the aid in Saturday morning Torres climbed into one of the whitepainted trucks and charged it across the bridge Though he broke through several barricades he also hit a woman trying to enter Colombia She escaped serious injury but he was forced to stop Getting out with his rifle in hand Torres raised his arms in surrender and helped the woman toward an ambulance As one of the first deserters he was quickly taken in and presented to Guaido who had sneaked across the border into Colombia to oversee the aid launch Torres said he stood at attention and pledged his loyalty to the 35yearold lawmaker recognized as Venezuelas interim president by over 50 nations including the United States and many Latin American countries Were still in time to change history he said Guaido told him For Gomez the breaking point came when he saw another National Guardsman hit in the face by a fire bomb Even though he was badly injured commanders wouldnt call an ambulance to take him to the hospital Gomez said Fearing what might happen if he himself was struck by protesters he decided to flee They wouldnt have done anything for me Gomez said As he darted into one of the hundreds of illegal dirt paths snaking across Venezuelas porous border with Colombia Gomez said colectivo gunmen shot in his direction He crossed the river and ran through the brush about a 20minute trek When he reached Colombian territory and spotted the military he put his hands up in a sign of peace Im coming to surrender he cried out Many said they worry their wives and children will face repercussions and they are concerned about how they will make ends meet Many soldiers who have fled in the last year have had difficulty getting work winding up making a meager living selling food on the streets Asked about who he left behind Torres said My wife and burst into tears Too choked up to speak about his daughter he could only hold up fingers to show how old she is 6 Nearly all the defectors would support a foreign intervention in Venezuela and join in the fight Guaido called on the international community Saturday evening to consider all options to resolve Venezuelas crisis after the clashes over the aid shipments resulted in four deaths and 300 people injured In a visit Monday to Colombias capital for a meeting of regional leaders US Vice President Mike Pence echoed Donald Trumps warning that all options are on the table but he gingerly avoided talking about the potential for military action Floating ideas among each other several of the defectors said they believe the best way forward is for more troops to desert and help form a resistance from abroad Some envisioned an intervention led solely by Venezuelans while others are convinced it can only be done with the help of an international coalition All said they dont see themselves as traitors but rather as troops intent on restoring Venezuelas

extra dollars for a USMexico border wall The move has escalated a clash over whether he has abused his powers to advance the signature pledge of his 2016 campaign The Houses 245182 vote Tuesday to block Trumps national emergency declaration fell well below the twothirds majority that would be needed to override what would be the first veto of Trumps presidency Thirteen Republican backed the Democrats measure as top Republicans worked to keep defections as low as possible wanting to avoid a tally suggesting that Trumps hold on lawmakers was weakening The issue is now before the Republicanrun Senate where there already were enough GOP defections to edge the resolution to the brink of passage Vice President Mike Pence used a lunch with Republican senators at the Capitol to try keeping them aboard citing a crisis at the border but there were no signs he had succeeded I personally couldnt handicap the outcome at this point said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy who plans a vote within the next three weeks He even said Republicans remained uncertain about the legality of Trumps move The showdown was forcing Republicans to cast uncomfortable votes pitting their support for a president popular with GOP voters against fears that his use of emergency powers would invite future Democratic presidents to do likewise House Republicans who joined all voting Democrats to support the resolution included moderates from competitive districts such as Fred Upton of Michigan and libertarianleaning conservatives like Thomas Massie from Kentucky The White House in a letter to lawmakers threatening a veto said blocking the declaration would undermine the administrations ability to respond effectively to the ongoing crisis at the border Republicans said Democrats were driven by politics and a desire to oppose Trump at every turn They said Trump had authority to declare an emergency to protect the country and they defended his claims of a crisis We are at war on the southern border with the drug cartels said Rep Pete Olson RTexas Trump has asserted that barriers would stop drugs from Mexico from entering the US In fact government figures show that 90 percent of drugs intercepted from Mexico are caught at ports of entry not remote areas where barriers would be constructed Democrats said Republicans repeatedly accused former President Barack Obama of flouting the Constitution which gives Congress control over spending but are ignoring Trumps effort to do the same Is your oath of office to Donald Trump or is your oath of office to the Constitution House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif asked Republicans Trumps push for the wall reflected a continuation of the antiimmigrant views that helped fuel his election some Democrats said Since when do we call human beings in need a national emergency said Mexicanborn Rep Jesus Chuy Garcia DIll Is he running out of insults for people like me Democrats said the crisis is a fiction manufactured by Trump to evade Congress vote this month to provide less than 14 billion for barrier construction That was well below the 57 billion Trump demanded as he forced a recordsetting 35day

Castro DTexas sponsor of the onesentence measure blocking the declaration called Trumps move constitutional vandalism Trump used a 1976 law to declare a national emergency and ordered the shift of 36

assets The money would be used to build steel barriers up to 30 feet tall and other barriers and for law enforcement efforts said a White House statement In the Senate three Republicans have said they will back Democrats drive to block the emergency declaration Maines Susan Collins Alaskas Lisa Murkowski and North Carolinas Thom Tillis One more GOP defection would provide enough votes to approve the Democratic measure assuming all Democrats and their independent allies back it Republicans said senators asked Pence numerous questions about which projects Trump would divert to pay for the wall with Sen Richard Shelby RAla saying the discussion was hearty Shelby chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee which controls spending said the committee would quickly backfill money for military construction with other funds he did not identify That issue wont stay alive long Shelby told reporters Sen John Thune of South Dakota the chief GOP vote counter said there may be GOP attempts to amend the House measure saying Republicans think they have amendments that would improve it That suggests that McConnell may try finding a way to add language that could sink the Democratic resolution or perhaps make it more palatable for Republicans The law requires the Senate to vote on a measure within 18 days of receiving it from the House Though presidents have declared 58 emergencies under the law this is the first aimed at acquiring money for an item Congress has explicitly refused to finance according to Elizabeth Goitein codirector for national security at New York University Law Schools Brennan Center for Justice This is also the first time Congress has cast votes on whether to annul an emergency declaration she said Several lawsuits have been filed aimed at blocking the money including by Democratic state attorneys general and progressive and environmental groups Those suits are likely to delay access to those funds for months or years  AP

dramatic experiment  deliberately inhaling a virus culled from sewage to attack her superbug Im really running out of options said Balasa who traveled from her Richmond Virginia home to Yale University for the lastresort treatment I know it might not have an effect But I am very hopeful Pitting one germ against another may sound radical but its a sign of a growing global crisis Increasingly people are dying of infections that once were easy to treat because many common bugs have evolved to withstand multiple antibiotics Some dubbed nightmare bacteria are untreatable Now scientists are racing to find novel alternatives to traditional antibiotics a hunt that is uncovering unusual ways to counter infection in unusual places One possible treatment tricks bacteria out of a nutrient they need to survive Others rev up the immune system to better fend off germs And viruses called bacteriophages  discovered a century ago but largely shelved in the West when easiertouse antibiotics came along  are being tried in a handful of emergency cases Peoples frustration with antibiotic resistance boiled over said Yale biologist Benjamin Chan who travels the world collecting phages and receives calls from desperate patients asking to try them Were more appreciative of the fact that we need alternatives Natures bacterial predator each phage variety targets a different bacterial strain Originally used to treat dysentery in the early 20th century today Chan looks in places like ditches ponds and yes sewage treatment plants for types that attack a variety of human infections The best places are often really dirty places because were dirty animals he said Chan saw hope for Balasa in a lab dish covered in brownish bacterial goo Balasa has a genetic disease called cystic fibrosis that scars her lungs and traps bacteria inside including a superbug named Pseudomonas aeruginosa A daily dose of inhaled antibiotics kept the infection in check until last fall when the drugs quit working A lastditch IV antibiotic wasnt helping much either Chan grew a sample of Balasas bacteria from her phlegm Then came the key test He dripped several pseudomonastargeting phages into the grimy dish  and clear circles began appearing as the viruses consumed the bugs around them But would what worked in the lab really help Balasas lungs BUGS OUTPACING DRUGS At least 23000 Americans die every year as a direct result of an antibioticresistant infection and many more die from related complications according to a 2013 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The CDC plans an updated count but other research has estimated the toll could be seven times higher And while there are no good counts in much of the world one oftencited British report said unless solutions are found by 2050 up to 10 million people globally could be dying from drugresistant infections slightly more than die from cancer today Yet few new antibiotics make it to market and many major drug companies have ended antibiotic research seeing little profit in medicines that germs will soon outsmart A recent report found just 11 traditional antibiotics being studied to treat any of the World Health Organizations list of worst bugs with no guarantee theyll work And while some people are more at risk  those getting surgery or cancer chemotherapy for example  antibiotic resistance is a problem essentially for everyone said Dr Anthony Fauci infectious diseases chief at the National Institutes of Health Over the next several years all indicators seem to point to the fact that this is going to get worse and worse he added LOOKING FOR BUGS WEAK SPOTS Finding alternatives means figuring out what the vulnerabilities of infecting bacteria are What do they need to cause an infection said Dr Pradeep Singh of the University of Washington Singh and fellow UW lung specialist Dr Christopher Goss zeroed in on iron a nutrient vital for bacterial growth It turns out that bugs cant always tell the difference between iron and a chemically similar metal named gallium Gallium doesnt nourish and knocks other systems out of whack Goss said For two small studies the researchers recruited cystic fibrosis patients who had antibioticresistant pseudomonas in their lungs but werent openly sick The patients received a fiveday infusion of a galliumbased drug Over the next few weeks their lung function improved enough that nextstep studies are being planned It just seems like a proactive way of destroying bacteria said study participant Tre LaRosa 24 of Cincinnati His sister died of cystic fibrosis and while his own CF is under control he worries that one day a resistant infection will flare I cant do anything to prevent that Antibiotic resistance I think is one of the least talked about and most significant concerns SPURRING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Fauci envisions doctors one day vaccinating people a few weeks before say a planned knee replacement to guard against catching a staph infection in the hospital Sixteen experimental vaccines are in development to target various infections according to a recent presentation to a presidential advisory council on resistant germs Particularly promising Fauci says are labengineered monoclonal antibodies designed to home in on specific bugs In one set of studies researchers are giving experimental antibodies to ventilator patients who have bacteria building up that could trigger pneumonia HARNESSING VIRUSES FOR THE BEST ATTACK In Virginia Balasa learned of another cystic fibrosis patient helped by Yales phage experiments and asked to try hoping to postpone the last option for CF a lung transplant Phages work very differently than traditional antibiotics Like a parasite the virus infiltrates bacterial cells and uses them to copy itself killing the bug as those copies pop out and search for more bacteria Once the infections gone the virus dies out Because each phage only recognizes certain bacteria it shouldnt kill off good bugs in the digestive tract like antibiotics do Bacteria evolve to escape phages just like they escape antibiotics but they generally make tradeoffs to do so  such as losing some of their antibiotic resistance said Yale evolutionary biologist Paul Turner For example some phages recognize bacteria by a pump on their surface that deflects antibiotics As the phages kill those bugs the bacteria rapidly evolve to get rid of that surface pump  meaning survivors should be susceptible to antibiotics again Its reviving an arsenal of drugs that are no longer useful Turner said Yales first test case was an 82yearold man near death from a heart implant teeming with untreatable pseudomonas Chan purified a phage from a Connecticut lake that hed matched to the patients germs and with emergency permission from the Food and Drug Administration doctors squirted it into the wound The mans infection disappeared Then doctors at the University of California San Diego saved a colleague whod been in a monthslong coma using an IV mixture of several phages that target a superbug named Acinetobacter baumannii Doctors and families began calling both centers seeking emergency care even as formal studies are being planned to try to prove phages value Theres an incredible opportunity here said Yale pulmonologist Dr Jon Koff But with that you have to have the appropriate amount of skepticism with careful testing to tell when it might help Last month Balasa became Yales eighth patient inhaling billions of phages over seven days Almost immediately she was coughing up fewer bacteria It took a few weeks for her to feel better though and during that time she switched briefly to some antibiotics shed previously given up Without a formal study its hard to know but Chans tests suggest phages killed much of her predominant pseudomonas strain and made the survivors sensitive again to a course of those antibiotics Balasa called that a very big success for me and was able to quit her antibiotics She didnt notice additional improvement after a second round of phages aimed at different strains The true test Balasa said is how long I can go without using any antibiotics again  The Associated Press Health  Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education The AP is solely responsible for

78,AP,https://apnews.com/07cf471f57234d3a8e4d1a729cd0347d,DETROIT AP  Fiat Chrysler on Tuesday announced a 45 billion plan that includes building the first new auto assembly plant in Detroit in almost three decades and increasing its workforce in the area by about 6500 jobs an investment officials touted as an uncommon opportunity to revive the regions economy Under the plan the company said it would reopen a shuttered engine plant in the city and convert another in the same complex into a future assembly plant for the Jeep Grand Cherokee and a new threerow fullsize Jeep SUV and plugin hybrid models for all The Motor City was once home to about a dozen massive auto production plants but a rash of closures helped to push Detroits unemployment rate to a peak of almost 29 percent a decade ago The new Chrysler plant would be the first since 1991 and is expected to add 3850 jobs The company said in a news release that it would add another 1100 new jobs at its Jefferson North Assembly plant in Detroit and roughly 1500 new jobs at facilities in the neighboring suburb of Warren The investment would roughly double FCAs hourly workforce in the city and the expected average wage for the new jobs is about 58000 a year Speaking at a news conference after the announcement Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan called the deal a once in a generational chance to change the economic fortunes of Detroit Gov Gretchen Whitmer said it has been a long time since Michigan has seen an automotive investment as big and transformative as Fiat Chryslers plan The investment will also have a ripple effect boosting the automotive industry and helping other nonauto businesses elsewhere in Michigan and other Midwest states Whitmer said Fiat Chrysler said the additional investments are subject to tax incentive packages it was working out with the city and state of Michigan The automaker would need about 200 acres 80 hectares of land for the project most owned by the city Great Lakes Water Authority DTE Energy and the Moroun family which owns significant amounts of city real estate and the Ambassador Bridge that connects Michigan to Ontario Canada Most of the needed land would be for expanding the footprint of the existing facility parking and other uses City officials signed a memorandum of understanding with the automaker and they were ironing out a deal to assemble land for the project over the next 60 days If enough land is acquired and the tax incentives approved construction is expected to start later this year and the first new vehicles could be in production by the end of 2020 The automakers injection of money and jobs into the Motor City contrasts sharply with news from rival General Motors Co which announced plans to shutter its DetroitHamtramck plant next year and plans to close four others in the US and Canada City officials insisted they would help bring those 5000 new jobs to the city without displacing any residents In the early 1980s thousands of people were relocated and a black and Polish neighborhood known as Poletown was razed for what became GMs DetroitHamtramck plant The company also said Ram heavy duty pickup truck production will stay in Mexico despite a previous announcement that it would move to a factory in Warren Instead the Warren plant will get the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer large SUVs plus it will continue to build the previous generation Ram lightduty pickup at least through this year Fiat Chryslers massive multilayered investment calls to mind online retailer Amazon which last year had more than 230 municipalities competing for its second headquarters and offering billions of dollars in inducements Northern Virginia and New York ultimately won the competition but Amazon recently canceled the New York project  and some 25000 promised jobs  after running into fierce opposition to those incentives from lawmakers and political activists on the left Fiat Chryslers industrial overture to the Detroit area is not the same said Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research an industry think tank in Ann Arbor Michigan For the automaker she said its akin to investing with friends in Michigan they know very well She noted that the city and state are likely to come to the table with something good because they see a realistic return on their investment The city said its offering 12 million in tax credits You wouldnt find local opposition to this issue like in New York  people in Detroit and Michigan want auto jobs Dziczek said Fiat Chrysler is not out there waving their dollars around saying Who will give us the most incentives  They werent playing an incentive game They were looking at a business case and what makes sense Company officials said SUVs remain in demand with strong sales and growth potential in domestic and overseas markets The companys chief financial officer told investors in June that trucks and SUVs would account for 80 percent of revenue by 2022 Union leaders also praised the announcement It is especially exciting because these are good union jobs that have been achieved through collective bargaining United Auto Workers Vice President Cindy Estrada said in a statement We now look forward to working with the city and other community leaders on a community benefits agreement that reimagines our city and empowers our citizens to create sustainable communities with longterm viability Detroits history has long been intertwined with the US auto industry with its attendant peaks and valleys Historically Detroits job losses have been reflected in its plummeting population About 18 million people lived in Detroit in the 1950s and Detroit was the nations fourthbiggest city in 1960 By 2016 it would rank 21st as the tens of thousands of the middle class fled to the suburbs More whites moved away following a riot in 1967 The black middle class made a similar exodus in the following decade About the same time the car plants that provided jobs and helped keep the city running were hiring fewer people Around 1970 Detroits unemployment rate was just over 7 percent It reached 25 percent by 1990 In 2009 the unemployment rate was close to 29 percent Today Detroit has fewer than 700000 residents But the citys unemployment rate last fall was down to about 8 percent Fiat Chrysler says its cutting about 1400 jobs at a plant in Belvidere Illinois that makes Jeep Cherokees  a move the automaker says is unrelated to a major investment in the Detroit area that could add 6500 workers Company officials say the cuts are because of softening demand globally for the SUV and not related to the Detroitarea investments The Illinois plant will continue with its remaining 3760 workers The company adds in a statement it will work to place laid off workers in open fulltime positions as they become available  Associated Press writers Corey Williams in Detroit and David Eggert in Lansing contributed to this story  This story has been corrected to

years about the special counsels Russia probe Now barring an eleventhhour surprise Trump and his allies are starting to see it as something potentially very different a political opportunity With Robert Muellers findings expected any day the president has grown increasingly confident the report will produce what he insisted all along no clear evidence of a conspiracy between Russia and his 2016 campaign And Trump and his advisers are considering how to weaponize those possible findings for the 2020 race according to current and former White House officials and presidential confidants who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations A change is underway as well among congressional Democrats who have long believed the report would offer damning evidence against the president The Democrats are busy building new avenues for evidence to come out opening a broad array of investigations of Trumps White House and businesses that go far beyond Muellers focus on Russian interference to help Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton Its a striking role reversal No one knows exactly what Mueller will say but Trump his allies and members of Congress are trying to map out the postprobe political dynamics One scenario would have seemed downright implausible until recently The president will take the findings and run on them rather than against them by painting the special counsel as an example of failed government overreach and Trump himself as the victim who managed to prove his innocence The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee Georgia Rep Doug Collins said on the House floor last week that he had a news flash for Democrats who had high hopes that the report would be damaging to Trump What happens when it comes back and says none of this was true the president did not do anything wrong Collins asked Then the meltdown will occur Trumps tweeted version was even more graphic The Democrats House investigative committees were going stone cold CRAZY That was in reaction to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadlers document requests to 81 people businesses and organizations related to Trump Nadler said his panel must look at a much broader question than Mueller has Adam Schiff chairman of the intelligence committee also said theres much more to look into Mueller he said cant be doing much of a money laundering investigation if he hasnt subpoenaed Deutsche Bank which has loaned millions of dollars to Trump Schiffs panel along with the House Financial Services Committee is looking into money laundering and Trumps foreign financial entanglements We have a separate and independent and important responsibility Schiff has said And that is to tell the country what happened The Russia probe taken over by Mueller in May 2017 has posed a mortal threat to the presidency since Trump was elected  a possible case for collusion or obstruction of justice that could begin a domino effect ending with impeachment Those fears still exist but as the investigation winds down other feelings have taken hold in the White House namely a cautious optimism that the worst is over that no smoking gun has been found Even if Muellers final report does not implicate the president in criminal conduct the investigation was far from fruitless His team brought charges against 34 people including six Trump associates and three companies His prosecutors revealed a sweeping criminal effort by Russians to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and showed that people connected to the Trump campaign were eager to exploit emails stolen from Democrats Trump of course has railed relentlessly against the probe deeming it a baseless witch hunt sometimes in all capital letters and has said it was based on unfounded allegations perpetrated by his deep state enemies in the Department of Justice as well as his foes in the Democratic Party and the media If the report proves anticlimactic says former House Speaker Newt Gingrich a strong Trump ally there would no longer be any justification for what the House Dems want to do They have their report they had the guy they wanted writing it and he had the full power of the federal government behind him and they still didnt get the president Trump can say Here is the report I didnt fire Mueller I didnt interfere with him If you want to keep investigating me it just shows that it is purely partisan In fact Trump has told his inner circle that if the report is underwhelming he will use Twitter and interviews to gloat over the findings complain about the probes cost and depict the entire investigation as an attempt to obstruct his agenda according to advisers and confidants The presidents campaign and proTrump outside groups will then likely amplify the message while his advisers expect the conservative media including Fox News to act as an echo chamber A fullthroated attack on the investigation portraying it as a failed coup could also be the centerpiece of Trump campaign events including rallies they say While Trumps base has long been suspicious of Mueller the presidents team believes independents and moderate Democrats who backed him in the last election but have since soured may return to the fold if convinced he has been unfairly targeted In the meantime the president and his surrogates will labor to link the report with the mounting investigations launched by House Democrats One of Trumps most ardent defenders North Carolina Rep Mark Meadows tweeted last month that Democrats will keep investigating if Mueller doesnt find what they want Amazing Meadows wrote in a separate tweet Their message is shifting The Russian collusion narrative is falling apart and they know it  Lemire reported from New York Associated Press writer Eric Tucker

probably wont plant this year But thats not his biggest worry He and other farmers have worked until midnight for days to move grain equipment and fuel barrels away from the floodwaters fed by heavy rain and snowmelt The rising water that has damaged hundreds of homes and been blamed for three deaths has also taken a heavy toll on agriculture inundating thousands of acres threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock In Fremont County alone Jorgenson estimates that more than a million bushels of corn and nearly half a million bushels of soybeans have been lost after water overwhelmed grain bins before they could be emptied of last years crop His calculation using local grain prices puts the financial loss at more than 7 million in grain alone Thats for about 28 farmers in his immediate area he said Once its deposited in bins grain is not insured so its just lost money This year farmers have stored much more grain than normal because of a large crop last year and fewer markets in which to sell soybeans because of a trade dispute with China The economy in agriculture is not very good right now It will end some of these folks farming family legacies family farms he said  There will be farmers that will be dealing with so much of a negative they wont be able to tolerate it Jorgenson 43 who has farmed since 1998 reached out to friends Saturday and they helped him

is expected to continue throughout the week in several states as high water flows down the Missouri River Swollen rivers have already breached more than a dozen levees in Nebraska Iowa and Missouri according to the Army Corps of Engineers The flooding which started after a massive latewinter storm last week has also put some hog farms in southwest Iowa underwater The dead animals inside must be disposed of Reynolds said The water rose so quickly that farmers in many areas had no time to get animals out said Chad Hart an agricultural economist at Iowa State University Places that havent seen animal loss have seen a lot of animal stress That means theyre not gaining weight and wont be marketed in as timely a manner which results in additional cost he said In all Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson estimated 400 million of crop losses from fields left unplanted or planted late and up to 500 million in livestock losses In a news release issued Tuesday Gov Pete Ricketts said there have been deadlier disasters in Nebraska but never one as widespread He said 65 of the states 93 counties are under emergency declarations In neighboring Missouri water was just shy of getting

91,AP,https://apnews.com/bdc70648e5814d25b549d1c252910006,WASHINGTON AP  President Donald Trump welcomed Brazils new farright leader to the White House Tuesday and made clear that flattery pays Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro  the Trump of the Tropics ran an unabashedly proTrump proAmerican campaign last year emulating Trump in tone and style It seems to have paid off for Bolsonaro on his first official trip to Washington At a joint news conference Trump announced that hed agreed to designate Brazil a major nonNATO ally  something Brazil had pursued to smooth US weapons purchases and military coordination Trump even said hed be open to granting full NATO membership to Latin Americas largest and most populous nation even though Brazil doesnt quality to join the North Atlantic alliance The showing was the latest example of the premium Trump puts on personal relationships and the extent to which hes willing to work with those who sing his virtues And it renewed focus on the growing wave of populist strongmen who have captured voters support with blunt admonitions of political correctness and hardline immigration views As they sat down for the first time Trump hailed Bolsonaros run as one of the incredible campaigns saying he was honored it had drawn comparisons to his own 2016 victory And he predicted the two would have a fantastic working relationship telling reporters at a joint press conference that they have many views in common The two also exchanged soccer jerseys in a sign of their budding friendship Bolsonaro was equally complimentary predicting Trump would win reelection in 2020 and drawing parallels between their efforts Standing sidebyside in the White House Rose Garden Bolsonaro said their two countries stand side by side in their efforts to ensure liberties and respect to traditional family lifestyles respect to God our Creator against the gender ideology or the politically correct attitudes and against fake news Im very proud to hear the president use the term fake news Trump later remarked The embrace represents a shift in USBrazilian relations In 2013 leaks from Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency had wiretapped conversations of former President Dilma Rousseff leading to several years of tense relations between the nations Bolsonaro had arrived in the US with a half a dozen ministers and a goal of expanding trade diplomatic and military cooperation between the two largest economies in the Western Hemisphere And Trump appeared eager to deliver He announced he would back Brazils efforts to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development while floating the idea of full NATO membership though he said hed have to talk to a lot of people for Brazil to join the organization However James Stavridis a retired Navy admiral who was the Supreme Allied Commander at NATO from 2009 to 2013 said Brazil does not qualify for full membership under the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 The idea of formal membership is a nonstarter in every dimension  the treaty doesnt allow it the Brazilians wouldnt want it and the Europeans wouldnt approve Stavridis said in an email exchange The efforts came as both countries continue to denounce the crisis in Venezuela and called on members of the Venezuelan military to end their support for President Nicolas Maduro Both the US and Brazil have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuelas legitimate leader and Trump reiterated that all options to address Venezuelas economic and political crisis remain on the table The leaders also were expected to discuss a range of other issues including expanding trade relations and increasing US privatesector investment in Brazil Bolsonaro has much in common with Trump He too ran an insurgent social mediapowered campaign And like Trump he has blasted unflattering stories as fake news and used Twitter and Facebook to bypass mainstream news organizations As a congressman Bolsonaro frequently made disparaging comments about gays women indigenous groups and blacks and he has praised torture and killings by police and waxed nostalgic for Brazils old military dictatorship While such comments have drawn sharp criticism they have also generated attention and fed into his narrative as a leader unencumbered by political correctness Bolsonaro has also echoed Trumps hardline immigration policies calling immigrants from several poor countries the scum of the world and saying Brazil cannot become a country of open borders In an interview with Fox News Monday Bolsonaro said he supported Trumps immigration policies and his efforts to build a wall along the USMexico border The majority of potential immigrants do not have good intentions or do not intend to do the best or do good for the American people he said Bolsonaro also had the support of Trumps former chief strategist Steve Bannon who has since parted ways with the White House While Bolsonaro has dismissed reports that Bannon played a key role in his campaign Bolsonaros son Eduardo approached Bannon in July of last year and the two struck up a friendship In August Eduardo posted a picture of the two of them on Instagram with a caption that said Bannon was an enthusiast of his fathers candidacy and that they would unite forces against cultural Marxism It was one of several meetings Bannon said On Sunday Bannon joined Bolsonaro for a dinner at the Brazilian Embassy along with various Cabinet members and other leaders where they discussed subjects including the countrys economic plans Bolsonaro Bannon told The Associated Press understands the Trump program and understands President Trump and said both represent a tectonic plate shift in the world of politics toward blunt politically incorrect leaders in the model of Trump This is a new kind of global political moment he said In advance of the meeting the countries signed several bilateral agreements including one that allows the United States to use Brazils Alcantara Aerospace Launch Base for its satellites Brazil also announced an end to visa requirements for US tourists who visit the country while Trump agreed to Brazilian participation in the Trusted Traveler Global Entry program Days after taking office on Jan 1 Bolsonaro a former army captain said Brazil would consider letting the US have a military base in the country as way to counter Russian influence in the region particularly related to Brazils neighbor Venezuela That statement was roundly criticized including by former military members of his government and the administration backed off  Prengaman reported from Rio de Janeiro Associated Press writers Mauricio Savarese in Madrid and Ben Fox Robert Burns Matthew Lee Catherine Lucey and

93,AP,https://apnews.com/11e5d55d2ebd40b28e00e90e2239dcf0,CHRISTCHURCH New Zealand AP  The leafy New Zealand city where a selfproclaimed racist fatally shot 50 people at mosques during Friday prayers is known for its picturesque meandering river and English heritage For decades Christchurch has also been the center of the countrys small but persistent white supremacist movement An expert on such fringe groups says its probably more than coincidence that the accused mosque shooter 28yearold Australian Brenton Tarrant settled in the region known for a whiter demographic than the countrys north after frequently traveling abroad in 20162018 in what appears to have been an extremeright pilgrimage He went mostly to areas of Europe with a long history of sectarian dispute including clashes between Renaissance Europe and the Ottoman Empire and the breakup of Yugoslavia following its ethnic and religious conflicts The attack has upended New Zealands image as one of the worlds safest and most tolerant countries It also has highlighted apparent failings by security and intelligence services to view white supremacists as a real threat or to take seriously warnings from Muslim groups of a rise in Islamophobic and xenophobic incidents in recent years Tarrant planned his attack on two mosques meticulously and had resolved two years earlier to kill Muslims according to a manifesto he published moments before the massacre He actively planned the Christchurch shootings for the past three months he said in the manifesto posted online and emailed to the office of New Zealands prime minister minutes before driving to his first target the goldendomed Al Noor mosque Police say they are certain Tarrant was the only gunman but may have had support and are investigating that possibility He had five guns two of which were converted into semiautomatic weapons Its likely that at least some were legally purchased online from a Christchurch gun store Possible links between the shooter and white supremacists in New Zealands south have been alleged by recreational gun user and hunting guide Pete Breidahl In a video posted on Facebook on Saturday he said he complained in late 2017 to an arms officer  a local police officer who monitors peoples gun licenses  about the disturbing behavior of members of a rifle club in the southern city of Dunedin that Tarrant reportedly joined In the video and comments posted online Breidahl said the club members had Confederate flags wore camouflage clothing with rank insignia vilified Muslims and had homicidal fantasies He claimed to have met Tarrant calling him not right Police said they have no record of a complaint but are looking into Breidahls claims further Academic Paul Spoonley who has extensively researched white supremacist groups in New Zealand said they have been relatively quiet in Christchurch since a 2011 earthquake that forced whole neighborhoods to move and altered the citys demographics with an influx of migrant workers for reconstruction Theyve been quieter recently but they havent gone away They are still here he said citing a 2016 incident in which pigs heads were left at the Al Noor mosque where 42 people died in Fridays massacre A business owner in Christchurch has also attracted media attention since the massacre because his companys vans were emblazoned with neoNazi references including the black sun symbol that Tarrants guns were covered with The same images which are used as the companys branding appear on its website When AP visited the registered business address located in one of Christchurchs poorer neighborhoods three of its vans were parked opposite their black sun imagery removed but still identifiable by a company website address on them A visibly hostile man standing beside the vans who did not appear to be the business owner did not want to answer questions Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a 44yearold man in Christchurch for distributing objectionable material and he would appear in court the next day According to Spoonley the level of hate crimes in New Zealand is low compared with other countries as is the number of white supremacists but its always a challenge to get people to accept that they exist Theres a reluctance to see equivalence between the risks presented by rightwing extremist groups and radical Islamic and leftist groups he said Neighboring Australias white supremacist scene is more virulent in part reflecting the history of its White Australia immigration policy which existed in various forms from soon after Federation in 1901 to as late as 1973 In modern times the rise of a succession of prominent rightwing politicians  starting with Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party in the mid1990s  also legitimized such views Spoonley estimates there are 200250 hardcore white supremacists in New Zealand and about 300400 people on the edges I would be very surprised if Tarrant didnt make some sort of contact he said The groups which emerged in the late 1960s have evolved over time coalescing for years around fear of New Zealand moving too far from its British roots antiSemitism and opposition to Maori sovereignty and Asian immigrants and then shifting to Islamophobia following the Sept 11 2001 attacks in the US Spoonley who researched extremeright groups in the UK in the 1970s said when he returned to New Zealand in the 1980s he was told by authorities there were no similar organizations But he quickly found more than 70 extremeright groups many of them in Christchurch He attributes three murders in New Zealand since 1989 to white supremacists including two that were ideologically motivated  a South Korean tourist in 2003 and a homeless gay man in 1999 As Tarrant plotted more recently Muslim groups in New Zealand were growing increasingly concerned by a rise in abuse against the community but say they were ignored There has been an increasing trend which has been brought to the attention of the authorities several times in the last three to four years including police said Anwar Ghani a spokesman for a federation of Islamic organizations It was treated not so seriously Verbal abuse hate emails hate phone calls and assaults that seem to have an Islamophobic and racist motivation or a combination of the two are among the hate crimes experienced by Muslims in New Zealand he said The country does not have an official hate crimes database making it difficult to measure the trend but some incidents have been widely reported causing outrage but sparking no real official measures Ghani said there are dotted lines between Fridays massacre hostility to Muslims among a segment of the New Zealand population and the global rise of extreme rightwing movements If the issue is not addressed in a proper manner then the problem will continue to increase he said They are getting bolder and bolder Paul Buchanan a former policy analyst and intelligence consultant for US government security agencies said the failure of intelligence agencies to detect Tarrant reflects politically based decisions to concentrate resources on monitoring the small number of Islamic extremists in New Zealand My interpretation is that in the past 20 years and since 911 a political decision was made to prioritize detection and prevention of homegrown jihadists he said They decided to go whole hog 8085 percent of resources into detecting jihadists he said The rest was devoted to Marxists environmentalists animal rights activists They went for the left One such jihadi from New Zealand along with an Australian was killed by a US drone strike in Yemen in November 2013 while fighting for alQaida There was no political advantage in targeting alienated young white men seen by the wider population as mostly harmless Pakeha losers a Maori word for white New Zealanders Buchanan said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said the government will convene an inquiry into the intelligence and security services seeking to understand why Tarrant was able to escape detection Tarrant according to Buchanan may have been part of a small cell There could be tacit enablers he said He was planning for two years Buchanan said To be able to do that in utter secrecy suggests someone had to have an inkling that the guy was going to do something and said nothing about it,0
94,AP,https://apnews.com/232c126bee2e462aa8787ac956f92c3f,PARIS AP  Bells of cathedrals across France rang in a moving tribute Wednesday to Notre Dame as firefighters and experts continued to keep the beloved but weakened landmark under close surveillance From Sacre Coeur in Paris to the cities of Strasbourg in the east and Rouen in the west the architectural treasures of France solemnly marked the inferno two days after it ravaged the gothic cathedral widely regarded as the soul of France I just arrived for the first ring of the bells and immediately there was an emotion Incredible indescribable I just cant explain it said Nadia PascassioComte in Strasbourg It was beautiful and sad at the same time I had tears in my eyes at one point and I think that this solidarity is magical it really unites a lot of people At Saint Sulpice church the secondlargest house of worship in Paris French first lady Brigitte Macron attended a special service for the annual blessing of the oils during Holy Week ahead of Easter Sunday Meanwhile restoration specialists questioned President Emmanuel Macrons ambitious fiveyear reconstruction timeline for Notre Dame with some suggesting it could take more than three times that amount of time to rebuild the 850yearold architectural treasure Even Prime Minister Edouard Philippe acknowledged Wednesday that it would be difficult This is obviously an immense challenge a historic responsibility Philippe said after a Cabinet meeting focused on the restoration Prominent French conservation architect Pierluigi Pericolo told Inrocks magazine the restoration work could take no less than 15 years  Its a colossal task Pericolo who worked on the restoration of the 19thcentury StDonatien Basilica which was badly damaged in a 2015 blaze in the French city of Nantes said it could take two to five years just to check the stability of Notre Dame which dominates the Paris skyline Its a fundamental step and very complex because its difficult to send workers into a monument whose vaulted ceilings are swollen with water Pericolo told FranceInfo The end of the fire doesnt mean the edifice is totally saved The stone can deteriorate when it is exposed to high temperatures and change its mineral composition and fracture inside Macron received some support for his lofty fiveyear restoration goal from his presidential cultural heritage envoy Stephane Bern who said it was realistic to reopen Notre Dame to the public in time for the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024 However he did not indicate whether the reconstruction work would be completed by then Speaking after a meeting at the presidential palace about the monuments reconstruction Bern said Macron didnt express his views regarding the rebuilding of the cathedrals lead roof or whether the frame should be restored in wood like the destroyed one or in metal or concrete He also said France would hold an international architecture competition to determine whether the collapsed 19thcentury spire would be rebuilt to the same design or a new one Meanwhile Notre Dames rector said he would close the cathedral for up to five to six years acknowledging that a segment of the structure may be gravely weakened According to a French government official the building would have burned to the ground in a chainreaction collapse had firefighters not moved as rapidly as they did to battle the blaze racing through the building The firefighters acted aggressively to protect wooden supports in the twin medieval bell towers from the flames averting a bigger catastrophe said José Vaz de Matos a fire expert with Frances Culture Ministry If the fire reached this wooden structure the bell tower would have been lost de Matos said at a news conference From the moment we lose the war of the bell towers we lose the cathedral because its a chainreaction collapse An initial fire alert was sounded at 620 pm as a Mass was underway in the cathedral but no fire was found A second alarm went off at 643 pm and the blaze was discovered on the roof No one was killed in the fire after firefighters and church officials speedily evacuated those inside Firefighters acted as fast as they could to save the cathedral said senior fire official Philippe Demay denying that there was any delay in their response Despite extensive damage many of the cathedrals treasures were saved including Notre Dames famous rose windows although they are not out of danger JeanMarc Fournier chaplain of the Paris fire brigade told Catholic broadcaster KTO that the trickiest part was reaching the person who held the security codes to open the safe containing the Crown of Thorns regarded as Notre Dames most sacred relic Paris Firefighters spokesman LtCol Gabriel Plus said that even though they are in good condition a threat continues to the gables or support walls because of the heavy stone statues perched on top of them The roof no longer holds the gables up They are holding up all by themselves he said adding that some statues must be removed to lessen the weight on the gables Scaffolding that had been erected for a renovation of the spire and roof must also be properly removed because of its weight and because it is now crucially deformed he added The Paris prosecutors office said investigators have been able to access some parts of the building although others remain too dangerous No indication of a criminal act had been found so far it said More than 40 people have already been questioned in the investigation including workers at the five construction companies who were involved in renovating the church spire and roof Police also took images of the destruction using drones in case it is altered by wind or rain Nearly 1 billion has been pledged for the cathedrals restoration coming from ordinary worshippers and wealthy magnates including those who own LOreal Chanel and Dior Bern told broadcaster FranceInfo that 880 million euros 995 million has been raised since the fire Criticism already has surfaced in France from those who say the money could be better spent elsewhere on smaller struggling churches or on workers Others have criticized the billionaires donations because their pledges make them eligible for huge deductions in taxes  Associated Press writers Thomas Adamson Angela Charlton Samuel Petrequin and Elaine Ganley in Paris and

belched yellow smoke spitting out gritty particles of wood stone lead and iron and wanted more Far below their vision obscured by fumes and tears firefighters priests and municipal workers passed treasures handtohand hoping the speed of desperation could outrun the flames They had 66 minutes The first alarm sounded at 620 pm silencing the priest and a few hundred worshippers and tourists inside Everyone was immobilized by shock for maybe a minute said Johann Vexo  who was in the organ loft as usual for the daily Mass on Monday Shock but no panic The rear doors opened and within a few minutes the cathedral was empty Vexo who had never before even heard the alarm go off lingered for a bit then made his way home For 23 minutes it seemed like a false alarm Then at 643 pm a second smoke detector went off and the fire showed its face flickering in the wooden timbers and visible to anyone looking north from Paris Left Bank The first firetrucks lumbered through rushhour traffic blasting their twotone sirens at full volume to reach the island that is the historic and geographic heart of Paris For that first halfhour it looked like the fire couldnt possibly leave more than a small age mark on the nearly 900yearold building  more akin to the inevitable wear on stones rough edges than the fury of the French Revolution that left it in ruins for decades Across the Seine in City Hall Mayor Anne Hidalgo glanced out the window during an evening meeting to see a yellow cloud blotting out the sky She rushed to the island So did Vexo who had spotted the cloud from his home I came here and felt powerless as the flames overtook the cathedral Hidalgo said Vexo watched the flames for a minute or two from across the river then turned away It was unbearable he said Bridge after bridge along the Seine filled with somber onlookers all facing the cathedral built for the ages They dotted the stone walkways that line the river They wept as flames melted the leadlined roof and overtook the cathedrals spire Below nestled deep in the cathedral was the treasure chest keeper of Notre Dames most sacred relics Firefighters cracked the chest open pulling out the Crown of Thorns revered as the one worn by Jesus Christ at his crucifixion Made of rushes wrapped into a wreath and tied with gold filament it had been kept under glass since 1896 The tunic of St Louis believed to have belonged to King Louis IX came out of the chest along with fragments of the cross and a nail said Patrick Chauvet rector of Notre Dame Cathedral The relics were safe Then came the artwork We had to get them in the smoke as debris was falling to protect them Gen JeanClaude Gallet of the fire brigade told BFM television At 749 pm the 19thcentury spire that was the architectural masterpiece of Eugène Emmanuel ViolletleDuc and his postRevolutionary restoration broke apart and fell through the nave The bronze weathercock tumbled taking with it three relics sealed inside in 1935 It had been 66 minutes since the first flames were spotted The sky above the cathedral flamed orange and the fire lurched toward Notre Dames iconic towers then slipped inside Myriam Chudzinski was among 20 firefighters already there Loaded with gear they climbed hundreds of steps up the narrow spiral staircase to the top of one of the two towers The chief corporal had trained at the cathedral for just this moment We knew that the roof was burning but we didnt really know the intensity she said It was from upstairs that you understood that it was really dramatic It was very hot and we had to retreat retreat It was spreading quickly She heard a roar but her focus was on saving the tower She learned later that it was the sound of the spire collapsing The spire was lost Could Notre Dame itself be saved From inside and out firefighters fought the battle of their lives  a battle for the ages At 949 pm Laurent Nunez deputy interior minister voiced the fear that haunted Paris and beyond The smell of smoke had long since reached beyond the city center permeating homes and apartments miles kilometers away Sirens wailed ceaselessly Hundreds of firefighters were doing their utmost And Nunez said no one knew whether it would be enough The 20 firefighters struggled on in the towers while a remotecontrolled robot moved into the nave Redhot embers floated down from the glowing hole where the spire once stood settling on the blackened marble floor and the pile of debris that was all that was left of the spire It had been a masterwork of ViolletleDuc and a tribute to what restoration could achieve said Kevin Murphy an expert on historical restoration from Vanderbilt University It was gone as were the roofs irreplaceable ancient wooden beams cut from trees that were alive a millennium ago The robot was immune to the danger The men and women battling inside and out were not At 1123 pm the fire chief said the rest of the structure including the cathedrals twin bell towers had been saved It had been within 30 minutes of collapse It took 10 more hours for the fire to be declared extinguished The spires bronze rooster long a symbol of France was found Tuesday deformed by the heat but recognizable nonetheless Beyond emotion beyond words beyond tears Christophe Castaner Frances interior minister said Tuesday as he visited the cathedral What I want to express is the pride of the

big graft probe that has put Perus most prominent politicians behind bars and provoked a reckoning over corruption Authorities broke through a door at Garcias mansion in a leafy upscale neighborhood of the Peruvian capital after hearing gunfire The 69yearold former head of state was rushed to a hospital where a team of doctors performed emergency surgery but could not save him The president upset over this situation knowing his absolute innocence  had this terrible accident said his lawyer Erasmo Reyna It was a shocking end for a man who twice governed Peru  once in the 1980s and then again

capital the child of a politician father whose party became Garcias own He went on to a career marked by epic triumphs and devastating setbacks a rollercoaster of a political life fueled by his charisma and capacity for reinvention Ultimately though the former president was an increasingly isolated figure As investigators closed in he argued that he was the victim of false testimony about taking bribes from Odebrecht during the construction of Limas metro He had not been formally charged In December Garcia sought asylum in Uruguays embassy staying there for a little more than two weeks before his request was denied Uruguayan President Tabaré Vázquez said there was no evidence to support Garcias contention he was being political targeted He vowed to cooperate with any investigation and defended himself up to the day before his death I am not mentioned in any document and in any evidence he wrote Tuesday on Twitter Theyre left to SPECULATE or invent intermediaries I never sold out and its proven When authorities arrived Wednesday at Garcias home they met him on the staircase to the second floor He asked for a moment to call his attorney entered another room and closed the door behind him Moments later gunfire rang out Police found him seated bleeding profusely Interior Minister Carlos Moran said Supporters who had gathered outside the hospital wept as word of his death spread Some held each other in embrace Others cried out A line of officers in helmets and riot shields stood guard keeping them at a distance His sudden death was sure to provoke reflection both over one of the most storied careers in Peruvian politics and the nations battle against corruption Tall and handsome Garcia was first swept into office on a wave of optimism in 1985 as Latin Americas youngest president at age 36 He was hailed as the president of hope Fed by state spending wage increases and price controls Garcias policies initially created an artificial economic boom But the state coffers were soon drained credit dried up and investors fled Labor strikes demanding wage increases in line with soaring inflation crippled production As Perus economy collapsed Maoist Shining Path guerrillas surged At one point Garcia was so depressed by his plunging popularity that he did not appear in public for more than a month and reportedly offered the presidency to his blind 88yearold vice president Luis Alberto Sanchez Garcia backed the candidacy of an independent political unknown Alberto Fujimori in the secondround runoff of the 1990 presidential elections to prevent a win by novelist Mario Vargas Llosa a conservative rival Two years after leaving office Garcia fled the country as Fujimoris new government pursued corruption charges against him He was accused among other things of taking kickbacks for a Lima electric railway contract and of depositing Perus reserves in the notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce International or BCCI which was later shut down worldwide amid fraud allegations On the night of April 5 1992 Fujimori dissolved Congress suspended the Peruvian Constitution and sent troops to the home of Garcia who had been warned of a plot to kill him That was perhaps the first time I felt physical fear in my life because I understood it was true there would be an attack and that we would die Garcia later recalled in an interview with The Associated Press I had two pistols with nine rounds each he said and I shot all 18 bullets into the air as they were preparing to knock down the garage wall with a small tank and were coming over the walls The soldiers briefly retreated Garcia said and he fled by climbing over a neighbors wall using a ladder He was later smuggled out of the neighborhood in the trunk of a car and eventually made it to the Colombian Embassy which granted him safe passage from Peru During his exile he split time between Colombia which gave him asylum and Paris where his wife and four children lived Garcia was reviled by most Peruvians who initially tolerated even lauded Fujimoris ironfisted rule grateful to him for taming the rebel insurgencies and cleaning up an economic disaster But in 2000 Fujimoris autocratic government crumbled amid mushrooming corruption scandals creating an opening for Garcias political comeback The charges were eventually dropped for lack of evidence Garcia returned to his homeland in 2001 to seek reelection casting himself as an elder statesman who had outgrown leftist ideas He lost narrowly in a second round of voting to UStrained economist Alejandro Toledo Then he set his sights on the 2006 election He was widely viewed as the lesser of two evils when he defeated radical nationalist Ollanta Humala in a runoff But he was determined to regain the trust of Peruvians telling them I am more mature and I would be an idiot if I were to commit the same mistakes His popularity rose as he implemented austerity measures in a nation beset by poverty He slashed his own salary by more than half and issued decrees forcing lawmakers to reduce their pay by nearly 40 percent He also gained praise by launching programs to bring potable water to poor shantytowns and pledged to build roads schools and health clinics in rural areas On Wednesday night his body was taken to a memorial service at his partys headquarters known as the House of the People a blue colonialstyle building where Garcia once celebrated his presidential victories Several men carried his wooden casket through a thick crowd of supporters chanting Alan Alan Hes still with the people they cried out,0

99,AP,https://apnews.com/c30ad3ac085a479487a10374327f911c,LITTLETON Colo AP  The first SWAT team members to see the horror in the Columbine High School library had to step around bodies and ignore a wounded students plea for help as they searched for shooters they didnt know had already died by their own hands As member Grant Whitus put it officers carried something home with them that day a level of trauma and a sense of futility that stayed with them for years and may have contributed to the teams demise It was just beyond anything Id ever thought Id see in my career he said of the 1999 shooting that left 12 students and a teacher dead and remains locked in the nations memory So many children were dead Amid the emotional toll of what it experienced the Jefferson County Regional SWAT team began to fall apart By 2002 only three of its 10 members remained The others were reassigned or left the department On the 20th anniversary of Columbine the effects of trauma and turmoil experienced by law enforcement authorities who respond to school shootings are still largely unknown Experts say agencies are reluctant to let researchers interview officers and dredge up potentially painful memories Many officers also view seeking psychiatric help as a sign of weakness  particularly in elite units like SWAT  and see their own mental health as secondary when civilians suffer grave loss Thats what they signed up for right To deal with this violence and see these violent outcomes said labor attorney Eric Brown who handles cases for Newtown Connecticut police officers So theres not a lot of empathy for them when they show the signs of PTSD or other mentally disabling side effects But attitudes are starting to change A group of global law enforcement administrators recently began work on a set of uniform guidelines for psychological care for SWAT teams and other officers who respond to the worst of the worst carnage State legislatures also are taking note with four states including Colorado recently passing laws to extend workers compensation for mental health to police and other first responders Colorado officers were on heightened alert just this week after a Florida teenager who authorities say was obsessed with the Columbine shooting made threats against the Denver area then died in an apparent suicide after a manhunt  After the 1999 attack in Littleton Jefferson County Regional SWAT team members went through a group debriefing and were offered departmentpaid therapy But due to the stigma attached therapy wasnt an accepted option said Whitus who added some officers would ask him Whats it going to take before you crack My response is I will never crack No matter what happens no matter what I see no matter what I do I will never crack Whitus said of his attitude at the time He thought seeing a therapist would have been my own weakness Whitus stayed on the team but didnt escape unscathed  he was divorced within a year as he dove into rebuilding the team and changing how the department responds to active shooter situations He rose to become head of the team but then tragedy struck again in 2006 when members responded to a shooting at Platte Canyon High School in the town of Bailey southwest of Denver A man entered the school took several female students hostage and sexually assaulted them then fatally shot one student and himself as SWAT officers moved in After that there was another exodus from the SWAT team with eight of the 12 sheriffs department members leaving  including Whitus  over the next three years Also with the team that day was Al Joyce a postColumbine recruit who volunteered 500 hours in a year as a reserve officer to get hired with the Golden Police Department west of Denver Joyce was among the members who stormed the classroom and saw the aftermath It wasnt long before the nightmares began and he started drinking heavily to avoid them He ended up leaving the SWAT team divorcing his wife and withdrawing from the world I wanted to just shut down turn off he said It didnt work out so well By 2013 he was out of law enforcement and homeless He moved back to his parents home in Maine Hes now in therapy and works a lowstress job as a cashier Current Jefferson County Regional SWAT leadership declined to comment for this article But Sgt Sean Joselyn who was recruited by Whitus and was a member of the team at Platte Canyon said attitudes had been changing because of Columbine The team had checkin meetings in the months after but he doesnt recall members talking about how they felt and doesnt know why so many left Joselyn later held the post of team leader until being reassigned in 2017 He said he encourages openness and trains officers to consider posttraumatic stress an injury that needs to be treated I think its bigger than what we realize Joselyn said  Part of the issue experts say is that mental health services and resources available to officers after traumatic events like school shootings vary widely from police agency to police agency across the US Most provide stress debriefings immediately after mass shootings But researcher Michele Galietta an associate psychology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice said those meetings should instead take place months later to see how an officer is doing after returning to a normal routine Studies show getting back to a normal routine after a traumatic event helps with overcoming the potential for lasting effects she said Meanwhile the International Association of Chiefs of Police said in March it is in the early stages of developing policies for police departments for providing psychological care following critical incidents A voluntary accreditation organization the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies offers a standard for employee assistance programs that include peertopeer counseling and confidential therapy School shootings can be particularly hard to cope with The more severe the violence the more innocent the victim and the more the officers feel that they were helpless to respond  and maybe just sheer body count as a fourth ingredient  thats going to produce a perfect storm of demoralization anger and despair said Laurence Miller a clinical forensic and police psychologist in Boca Raton Florida Beyond posttraumatic stress secondguessing about a departments response and other factors can cause turmoil within law enforcement agencies After the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that left 17 dead in February 2018 Floridas governor removed Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel for his alleged failure to properly train his deputies on how to respond to active shooters tactics changed because of Columbine Five of the departments top command staff resigned some citing Israels removal Israel is appealing his removal to the Florida Supreme Court Six members of the Broward County SWAT team also left within a year including its two top commanders and many were reassigned within the team according to documents released under an Associated Press public records request After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting where 20 children and six adults died more than a dozen police officers took time off and one was too traumatized to return to work That Newtown Connecticut officer Tom Bean was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and the department agreed to pay him 380000 after the police union and Brown the labor attorney took the case to arbitration Brown said all the officers experienced posttraumatic stress but the department lacked proper procedures for dealing with it especially with providing paid time off There was no process in place from a legal point of view or even from sort of a systems point of view within the department of dealing with it Brown said Those officers who responded to that call should have immediately been put out on leave to get immediate aid to deal with the aftereffects of what they saw Newtown Police Department Lt Aaron Bahamonde said mental health care policies and practices were in place at the time of the shooting and they were boosted afterward They include making counselors available for officers and for group sitdowns after traumatic events along with working with mental health providers to identify officers at risk Bahamonde said theres a blank check for officers to get the services they need Were not going to sweep it under the rug he said  Whitus now lives in Lake Havasu City Arizona but still works to prevent school shootings through a business that places armed security guards in private schools He also operates a security company for marijuana businesses He said hed like to see all officers exposed to traumatic situations undergo mandatory counseling which would give those who need it a chance to get therapy without stigma since everybody would be required to participate That might help prevent future SWAT teams from falling apart like his did  twice Meanwhile researchers say a new generation of police officers is rising to leadership positions which is starting to change attitudes toward mental health Organizations such as Blue HELP which tracks police officer suicide have started to advocate for better mental health care for officers One of the groups board members is a highranking member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police Since 2017 four states  Colorado Texas Vermont South Carolina  have passed laws to extend workers compensation to first responders for mental health issues such as PTSD according to the National Council of State Legislatures Another five states  Alabama New Hampshire Minnesota Connecticut and Florida  have legislation pending this year About a dozen more considered and rejected similar measures But barriers remain including a culture within some SWAT teams that makes it taboo for members to talk to outsiders or even each other when theyre struggling Its a culture that Whitus admits he once contributed to If they told me Id be like Whats wrong with you Youre a SWAT guy he said So Im part of the problem  Associated Press writer Dave

100,AP,https://apnews.com/b2787dedd34345f798b89201fb4d1972,CORAL GABLES Fla AP  The Trump administration on Wednesday intensified its crackdown on Cuba Nicaragua and Venezuela rolling back Obama administration policy and announcing new restrictions and sanctions against the three countries whose leaders national security adviser John Bolton dubbed the three stooges of socialism The troika of tyranny  Cuba Venezuela and Nicaragua  is beginning to crumble Bolton said in a hardhitting speech near Miami on the 58th anniversary of the United States failed Bay of Pigs invasion of the island an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government The measures seem likely to hit hardest in Cuba which is at a moment of severe economic weakness as it struggles to find cash to import basic food and other supplies following a drop in aid from Venezuela and a string of bad years in other key economic sectors Bolton announced a new cap on the amount of money that families in the United States can send their relatives in Cuba The Obama administration had lifted limits on remittances but the new limit will be 1000 per person per quarter Remittances to Cuba from the United States amounted to 3 billion in 2016 according to the State Department Washington also moved to restrict nonfamily travel after a broad loosening of socalled purposeful visits under Obama led to soaring numbers of American trips for cultural and educational exchanges Details on the restrictions were not immediately clear but tourism is a key lifeline of hard currency for Cuba Bolton called such visits veiled tourism Bolton spoke hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a new policy allowing lawsuits against foreign firms operating on properties Cuba seized from Americans after the 1959 revolution The United States has enforced a trade embargo against Cuba since the early 1960s Cuban officials met the announcements with defiance Nobody will snatch away from us neither through seduction nor force the Fatherland that our parents won for us by standing up President Miguel DíazCanel said via Twitter We Cubans will not surrender Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez called it an attack on international law Cuban sovereignty and countries that would do business with the island Aggressive escalation by hashtagUS against Cuba will fail Like at Giron we will be victorious he tweeted referring to a Bay of Pigs beach where invaders landed We will always be willing to have a dialogue based on absolute respect but if the US government has chosen a confrontational path we will not hesitate to defend the gains of the revolution at any cost Rodríguez later said on state television On Venezuela Bolton said Washington was sanctioning the countrys Central Bank which the Trump administration says has been instrumental in propping up the embattled government of President Nicolás Maduro The sanctions do not bar humanitarian aid or private remittances and aim to ensure reliability of debit and credit card transactions which have become essential amid skyrocketing inflation and a shortage of cash notes Maduro called the move the latest example of imperialist aggression In a nationally broadcast TV appearance he said any nations central bank is sacred and deserves respect I see imperialism as crazy desperate Maduro said Bolton also announced sanctions against financial services provider Bancorp which he claimed is a slush fund for Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega The United States looks forward to watching each corner of this sordid triangle of terror fall in Havana in Caracas and in Managua Bolton said in South Florida which is home to many thousands of exiles and immigrants from the three countries He said Obama administration policies had given the Cuban government political cover to expand its malign influence across the region including in Venezuela Cuba has trained Venezuelan security forces to repress civilians and support Maduro Bolton said calling Maduro quite simply a Cuban puppet Boltons pledge to never ever abandon the people of Cuba Venezuela and Nicaragua in their fight for freedom also might ring hollow in light of the historical events he sought to highlight at the event hosted by the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association Many Cuban Americans to this day resent the late President John F Kennedy for not deploying American troops at a critical moment in the Bay of Pigs invasion Meanwhile with the high stakes of the Cold War a fading memory some critics of US policy toward Venezuela worry the Trump administrations stance that all options are on the table including a military one to oust Maduro is an empty threat that will only serve to ignite the streets and geopolitical tensions with Russia compounding the misery of Venezuelan citizens Honoring one of US greatest military fiascos from 60 years back suggests US policy to Latin America owes more now to a perverse Cold War nostalgia than practical benefits for people of the region said Ivan Briscoe the Latin American director for the International Crisis Group a Brusselsbased think tank Collin Laverty president of Cuba Educational Travel said in a statement that the measures on remittances and travel threaten the economic survival of Cuban families and the viability of thousands of independent small businesses allowed to operate since 2010 under reforms implemented by former President Raúl Castro The only winners here are a handful of members of Congress and those stuck in the past that support them Laverty said The losers are millions of Cubans on and off the island and the overwhelming majority of Americans that support engagement with Cuba Many of the 400 or so who paid 100 to attend Boltons speech at the Biltmore in South Florida were of Cuban descent Rafael UsaTorres a member of the 2506 Brigade that worked for the CIA at the time of the invasion said he has faith the measures will bring down DíazCanels government though he wished it had been done sooner Today is a big day the 78yearold said But I feel very sad  too many years waiting Others said Washington isnt going far enough Manuel MenendezPou 79 said the Cuban government had confiscated some 63 million in property from his family once one of the wealthiest on the island mainly in the sugar industry The problem is not the money MenendezPou also a former member of the brigade said minutes before the speech They stole our life In Havana homemaker Odalis Salazar worried about the future of remittances she receives from two children living abroad including one in the United States It hurts everyone and Trump is absolutely criminal because he knows that  the remittances help us a lot Salazar said We Cubans have families there and we get by largely with that help that they send us Pompeos decision on allowing lawsuits lets Americans including Cubans who became naturalized citizens sue companies that operate out of hotels tobacco factories distilleries and other properties nationalized after Fidel Castro took power Pompeo said he would not renew a bar on litigation that has been in place for two decades meaning lawsuits can be filed starting May 2 when the current suspension expires The Justice Department has certified roughly 6000 claims as having merit said Kimberly Breier the top US diplomat for the Americas Those claims have an estimated value of 8 billion 2 billion in property and 6 billion in interest she said An additional 200000 uncertified claims could run into the tens of billions of dollars she said Breier said there would be no exceptions to the policy but foreign companies will have nothing to worry about if they are not operating on properties taken from Americans Nonetheless companies in the European Union and Canadian companies stand to lose tens of billions in compensation and interest and the decision prompted stern responses and vows to protect businesses from lawsuits In a statement EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland called the decision to remove the longstanding waivers regrettable and said it can only lead to an unnecessary spiral of legal actions In Spain which has large investments in hotels and other tourismrelated ventures on the island a senior government official said Madrid would ask the EU to mount a challenge at the World Trade Organization The extraterritorial application of the US embargo is illegal and violates international law said Alberto Navarro EU ambassador to Cuba  Associated Press writers Michael Weissenstein in Miami Andrea

of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory something Pakistan denies Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslimmajority Kashmir but control only parts of it The two have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947  and all but one were over Kashmir The strikes are the first launched across the line of control  the de facto border that divides Indiaadministered Kashmir from Pakistanadministered Kashmir  since a war between the two countries in 1971 The two sides have given different versions of events Indian officials said the strikes hit a

Union urged maximum restraint from both sides with China making a similar plea  Analysis by M Ilyas Khan BBC News Islamabad The Indian air strikes that hit a target inside Pakistani territory have taken tensions to a dangerous level In September 2016 an attack on an Indian army base in Uri created a similar situation when Delhi decided to respond with socalled surgical strikes Indias claims that they airdropped special forces to destroy militant camps on the Pakistani side of Kashmir were found to be largely exaggerated but Indian troops did cross at several points along the Line of Control LoC inflicting some casualties on Pakistani forces This time they have hit a target across the international border inside Pakistani territory at a location where a training camp of Kashmiri militants is known to have existed for several years Pakistans military has cordoned off the area and not even the local police are allowed in so it will be some time before details of the attack become known Also Pakistani officials have been underplaying the severity of the incident by describing it as a strike across the LoC not one across the international border Pakistan has vowed to respond but this may not go beyond diplomatic measures However as some observers point out there may be punitive attacks by militants against Indian forces in Kashmir at an appropriate time   This

123,BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47961424,Sudans former President Omar alBashir has been moved to Kobar maximum security prison days after he was deposed in a military coup Reports say the exleader has until now been detained at the presidential residence under heavy guard  He is reportedly being held in solitary confinement and is surrounded by tight security Months of protests in Sudan led to the ousting and arrest of the longtime ruler on Thursday Ugandas Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Oryem Okello told Reuters news agency the country would consider offering the deposed leader asylum if he applied despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court ICC As an ICC member Uganda would have to hand over Mr Bashir if he arrived in the country The ICC has not yet commented Until now Mr Bashirs whereabouts since his removal were unknown The coup leader at the time Awad Ibn Auf said Mr Bashir was being detained in a safe place He himself stood down soon afterwards Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan was then named as head of the transitional military council to become Sudans third leader in as many days Demonstrators have vowed to stay on the streets until there is an immediate move to civilian rule This video can not be played Protesters wont move until they get real change By Joe Inwood BBC News Khartoum A sea of doctors shouting with such anger and passion that their voices crack Thousands are still protesting outside the military institutions that for 30 years sustained the brutal regime of President Bashir Now the military council that deposed him is struggling to maintain an increasingly fragile grip on power while the man who once led the country sits in prison  Today it has emerged he is in solitary confinement locked in the very place where so many of his victims were held tortured and killed  Ordinary people have managed to bring an entrenched and violent regime to its knees They have done it not through force of arms but through calm conviction passion and a dedication to their cause that you can see in their eyes  Mr Bashir led Sudan for close to 30 years He is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudans western Darfur region for which the ICC issued an arrest warrant After months of protests  starting in response to a rise in living costs and morphing into calls for the government to resign  Sudans military toppled Mr Bashir in a coup on Thursday The transitional military council was set up in the wake of his removal and has said it will stay in place for a maximum of two years until a civilian government can be put in place Kober prison situated on the east bank of the Blue Nile was built during Britains near 60year colonial rule of Sudan  The building built with bricks and surrounded by towering concrete walls has the capacity to hold hundreds of prisoners Space in its tiny cells however is said to be scarce  Many of the protesters and opposition leaders who took to the streets demanding Mr Bashirs resignation have been detained on its special wing for political prisoners  Sudans feared National Intelligence and Security Service runs this wing not the police Sudan analyst Alex de Waal who has visited the prison told the BBC its infrastructure has not been updated since it was built  The cells are very rudimentary it is a very basic form of accommodation there is no air conditioning or running water he said  Nevertheless the prison has a reputation for treating the inmates well and not subjecting them to random violence he added A former detainee at the prison told AFP news agency that up to seven prisoners most of whom are petty criminals are typically housed in each cell  There is a bathroom in each cell but no beds  only mattresses and mosquitoes the former inmate who was jailed there during protests against Mr Bashirs rule in January last year said Demonstrators remain camped out the military headquarters in the Sudanese capital Khartoum Reports on Monday said there had been efforts to disperse a sitin but protesters joined hands and troops stepped back from a confrontation The Sudanese Professionals Association SPA which has spearheaded the protests urged supporters to stop efforts to disperse them calling on demonstrators to protect your revolution and your accomplishments An SPA spokesman told the BBC that the group completely rejected the transitional military council leading the country and said protesters seek the dismantling of state intelligence agencies and the full dissolution of the deep state Military council spokesman Maj Gen Shams Addin Shanto announced a raft of new measures on Sunday including the end of censorship and new heads of the security forces The council has arrested former government members he said and will put in place whatever civilian government and whichever prime minister opposition groups agree But while the council promised not to remove protesters from their sitin the major also called on them to stop unauthorised roadblocks and let normal life resume Taking up arms will not be tolerated he added This video can not be played A former adviser to Mr Bashir

125,BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47366398,This video can not be played Mr Trump landed in Hanoi hours after Mr Kim arrived by car US President Donald Trump has arrived in Vietnam ahead of his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jongun Air Force One landed at Hanois Noi Bai airport hours after Mr Kim reached the Vietnamese capital by train and car The summit which is due to take place on Wednesday and Thursday follows a historic first round of talks in Singapore last year The two leaders are expected to discuss progress towards ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons Ceremonial guards had lined a red carpet laid out for Mr Kim as he arrived at Dong Dang border station on Tuesday morning He was then driven to Hanoi where heavy security and flagwaving crowds were waiting for him This video can not be played Mr Kim arrived by train at the border station of Dong Dang Mr Kim is thought to be travelling with his sister Kim Yojong and one of his key negotiators former General Kim Yongchol both familiar faces from the previous summit with Mr Trump  The journey from Pyongyang to Vietnam took more than two days and traversed about 4000 km 2485 miles Had Mr Kim chosen to fly to Vietnam he would have got there in a matter of hours As Mr Kims train passed through China roads were closed and train stations shut down  Chinese social media was abuzz with road closures traffic congestion and delayed trains This video can not be played Kim Jongun boards his train Vietnams Dong Dang station was also closed to the public ahead of his arrival on Tuesday morning He is now being driven around 170km 105mi to Hanoi by car  Its little surprise that Mr Kim chose to take the train as this is how his grandfather North Koreas first leader Kim llsung  travelled when he went to Vietnam and Eastern Europe  That alone would have made it a highly symbolic move for the younger Mr Kim  Mr Kims private green and yellow train has 21 bulletproof carriages and is luxurious with plush pink leather sofas and conference rooms so the journey would not have been uncomfortable   Unlike the North Korean leader Mr Trump travelled to Hanoi by plane The presidential airliner Air Force One left Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland landing in the Vietnamese capital on Tuesday night local time Details of their schedule are only just becoming clear Mr Trump will meet Mr Kim for a brief oneonone conversation on Wednesday evening and then they will have dinner together with their advisers according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders On Thursday the leaders will meet for a series of backandforth meetings  The Hanoi meeting is expected to build on the groundwork of what was achieved at the Singapore summit last June That meeting produced a vaguely worded agreement with both leaders agreeing to work towards denuclearisation  though it was never made clear what this would entail  However little diplomatic progress was made following the summit This time round both leaders will be very conscious that expectations will be high for an outcome that demonstrates tangible signs of progress However Mr Trump appeared to be managing expectations ahead of the summit saying he was in no rush to press for North Koreas denuclearisation  I dont want to rush anybody I just dont want testing As long as theres no testing were happy he said Washington had previously said that North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief    Its an ideal location for many reasons It has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea despite once having been enemies with the US  and could be used by the US as an example of two countries working together and setting aside their past grievances Ideologically both Vietnam and North Korea are communist countries  though Vietnam has rapidly developed since and become one of the fastest growing economies in Asia all while the party there retains absolute power North

127,BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-47366083,They were sex abuse allegations that rocked the Catholic Church and generated enormous interest  only for the case to vanish suddenly from public view for nine months The trial and conviction of Cardinal George Pell can now be reported after an Australian judge lifted a legal order that had prohibited coverage  The sweeping ban known as a suppression order was handed down last May It was deemed necessary to give Pell fair hearings but caused big debate Police charged Pell with sex offences in June 2017 saying only that he faced historical allegations by multiple complainants The cardinal immediately denied any wrongdoing   Some pretrial hearings where Pell was swamped by media outside court were allowed to be reported  Those hearings revealed for the first time that Pell faced separate accusations from the 1990s and the 1970s Consequently a judge ordered that two trials  with separate juries  would take place In a bid to prevent the first trial influencing the second the judge agreed to an immediate suppression order  It made it illegal to report that any trial was taking place Even saying that the suppression order existed was prohibited It allowed reporting that Pell was facing abuse allegations but nothing more specific The legal order legally applied only to Australia But it effectively extended to international media which publish or broadcast into Australia or can be accessed there a tough thing to avoid in the internet age That may be subject to legal debate but the judge expressed fury about some reporting  Australian outlets were generally most cautious with journalists sitting in regularly on Pells case and adhering to the ban The blackout did not go totally unnoticed publicly Social media users for instance frequently speculated about it  But matters escalated dramatically in December when numerous nonAustralian outlets published stories reporting that Pell had been convicted The words George Pell were soon trending online including in Australia It prompted some of Australias biggest newspapers to run frontpage editorials criticising the suppression order Unlike overseas media they did not name Pell The world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians wrote Melbournes Herald Sun below a headline CENSORED The Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this significant news But trust us Its a story you deserve to read Sydneys Daily Telegraph described it as the nations biggest story and wrote An awful crime The person is guilty Yet we cant publish it Melbourne newspaper The Age and other publications also published articles some giving details of the case In a specially convened court hearing on 13 December Judge Peter Kidd said he was angry about media reports though he did not mention specific outlets  Given how potentially egregious and flagrant these breaches are a number of very important people in the media are facing if found guilty the prospect of imprisonment and indeed substantial imprisonment he told lawyers for the prosecution and defence The judge left the matter with prosecutors to investigate Digital versions of some front pages were later unavailable Those outraged front pages by the dailytelegraph and theheraldsun railing against censorship Theyve now been censored online Has the court been in touch  pictwittercomDR6F3qNDIf Other Australian journalists however voiced support for the suppression order expressing concerns that publicity could influence a court outcome Eight years covering Victorian courts and Ive seen more ridiculous suppression orders than most But thats not whats going on here This is a contempt of court issue and its right that it shouldnt be reported It would be a tragedy if publicity now meant justice delayed httpstcoer1bGciyar Some say it was not but others disagree arguing that most people did not know about Pells conviction before Tuesday  And ultimately his second trial will not proceed On Tuesday prosecutors withdrew the charges relating to the 1970s Lawyer Justin Quill whose firm is acting on behalf of local media outlets argued that judges needed to have more faith in jurors to form their view from a courtroom even if they had seen something related to the case on social media  For the public to not be told about Pells conviction until nearly three months later is in my view a situation that is not appropriate he told the BBC He also said courts could not go around charging 10000 people for one or two comments theyve made on Twitter adding Mainstream media is being held to one standard and the general public is being held to another  it just doesnt make sense Suppression orders are common in Australia unlike in other countries such as the US But the state of Victoria in particular has come in for criticism accounting for more than half of the countrys orders local media reports  Critics sometimes deride it as The Suppression State The editorials of nations newspapers on Victoria The Suppression State are pertinent  timely The erosion of open courts principle in Vic has troubled me for years But never more so more personally and painfully than now You either believe in open justice or you do not State Premier Daniel Andrews has vowed to implement 18 recommendations from a review by a retired judge that called for a realworld approach to suppression orders given how quickly information can be spread online This is about making sure the laws relating to contempt of court and suppression orders are working effectively by protecting victims but also the publics right to know as well as court processes state Attorney General Martin Pakula said in October Cardinal Pell guilty of child sexual abuse The Popes biggest

181,Breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/16/attorney-general-barr-blocks-catch-and-release-by-migration-judges/,Immigration judges cannot release migrants who are caught sneaking into the United States even if the migrants ask for asylum says a binding legal decision by Attorney General William Barr The decision will dramatically shift the migrationcaused civic and housing crises from the nations bluecollar communities over to the Congress and the Department of Homeland Security whose budget and detention centers only have enough resources to house about 50000 people yearround The text of the relevant Act provides that if an alien in expedited proceedings establishes a credible fear he shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum says Barrs April 16 decision titledxa0Matter of MS Because of the law I order that unless DHS paroles the respondent under section 212d5A of the Act he must be detained until his removal proceedings conclude This is a HUGE ruling that will harm thousands seeking protection from persecution at the US border since far more will be held in detention even after passing the threshold screening under the credible fear standard complained Greg Chen director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association The associations lawyers make their money by guiding migrants and corporate hiring managers through the extremely dense network of migration laws and regulations But Barrs decision blocks the use of a common path for migrants who are trying to get through the courts and into the US jobs they need to repay the smuggling fees they owe to the cartels Barr directed officials to delay implementation of the law for 90 days giving DHS managers  and congressional leaders  three months to decide which migrants should be released into the nations cities and towns The delay gives time for DHS to set up tent cities where migrants can be held until the judges decide the asylum pleas If DHS detains most of the migrants  and so prevents them from working  the next wave of migrants may decide that any effort to get into the United would be an economic disaster for their families On April 15 Democratic Sen Bernie Sanders endorsed the wider use of detention centers on the border Sen Bernie Sanders supports border detention  asylum processing of migrants The detention would end the catchandrelease policies which fund  encourage the migration FWIW progressives  biz will OK border centers if most migrants are given asylum httpstcomXoAAfaozz  Neil Munro NeilMunroDC April 16 2019 Barrs decision is part of a large legal battle of movecountermove between President Donald Trumps deputies and the many promigration progressive judges in the federal courts Massive resistance by those judges has blocked and delayed many of Trumps policies but Trumps deputies are expected to win most of the decisions if and when the US Supreme Court decides to rule on each dispute Barrs new ruling does not apply to the many UAC migrant minors who are being smuggled northwards by parents living illegally in the United States It also does not apply to migrants who walk up to the nations official ports of entry to ask for asylum But the ruling will apply to the huge number of migrants who cross the borderline away from the ports of entry Those migrants must now be held for many months  or even years xa0 unless DHS leaders formally release the migrants The decision ensures that migration judges preference  and migration lawyers pleadings  will not allow the illegal migrants to be released on bonds which are often a tiny fraction of the economic value gained by the migrants from working illegally in the United States However the decision also raises the incentives for migrants to legally apply for asylum through the formal process at the ports of entry instead of trying to sneak past the border patrol The decision does not overcome the 2015 Flores decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California which forces DHS to release migrants who bring children Federal agencies however are drafting a regulation that may bypass that court Flores ruling The AGs decision is based on the treatment of a migrant from India who is part of a small but fastgrowing stream of very cheap laborers who are being hired by the growing population of Indian legal immigrants According to Barr The respondent here is a citizen of India He traveled to Mexico and crossed illegally into the United States He was apprehended within hours about 50 miles north of the border DHS placed him in expedited removal proceedings After the respondent claimed a fear of persecution in India DHS referred him for an asylum interview The asylum officer determined that the respondent lacked a credible fear but at the respondents request DHS reconsidered and reversed its determination DHS then transferred the respondent to full proceedings Upon his transfer DHS issued the respondent a Notice to Appear DHS Form I862 and a Notice of Custody Determination DHS Form I286 the latter of which informed the respondent that pending a final administrative determination in your case you will be    detained by the Department of Homeland Security The respondent requested that an immigration judge review that custody determination Without mentioning section 235b1Bii the immigration judge held that the respondent is not subject to mandatory detention Matter of MS Order on Motion for Custody Redetermination at 2 Immig Ct July 18 2018 The immigration judge ordered that the respondent be released if he could produce a valid Indian passport and post a bond of 17500 Id at 3 The respondent appealed to the Board arguing that his bond should be reduced  A different immigration judge agreed but increased the respondents bond to 27000 Matter of MS Order on Motion for Custody Redetermination at 2 Immig Ct Sept 17 2018 The respondent posted that amount and was released on September 27 2018  Here despite the respondent being bond ineligible the second immigration judge ordered DHS to release him on a bond of 27000 The respondent posted that bond in September 2018 and was released from custody I reverse the order granting bond to the respondent I order that unless DHS paroles the respondent under section 212d5A of the Act he must be detained until his

188,Breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/03/19/ssupreme-court-criminal-aliens-cannot-escape-detention-by-dodging-federal-agents/,WASHINGTON DC  Criminal aliens are not shielded from a federal mandatory detention law when federal agents do not arrest them immediately upon release from state prisons according to a 54 Supreme Court decision on Wednesday rejecting arguments from the ACLU and leftwing politicians The case involves a provision of federal law requiring federal detention of certain classes of aliens while the government seeks to deport them both legal and illegal The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit interpreted the law in a way that severely limited the US Department of Homeland Securitys authority to detain those aliens while deportation proceedings are underway Aliens who are arrested because they are believed to be deportable may generally apply for release on bond or parole while the question of their removal is being decided Justice Samuel Alito began for the Court citing 8 USC  1226a which applies to most noncitizens These aliens may secure their release by proving to the satisfaction of a Department of Homeland Security officer or an immigration judge that they would not endanger others and would not flee if released from custody Congress has decided however that this procedure is too risky in some instances Congress therefore adopted a special rule for aliens who have committed certain dangerous crimes and those who have connections to terrorism the Court continued pivoting to the federal law at issue in this case Under 8 U S C  1226c these aliens must be arrested when they are released from custody on criminal charges and with one narrow exception not involved in these cases must be detained without a bond hearing until the question of their removal is resolved Alito explained that  1226a applies to most  aliens and it sets out the general rule regarding their arrest and detention pending a decision on removal This general section generally gives the Secretary the discretion either to detain the alien or to release him on bond or parole But while 8 U S C  1226a generally permits an alien to seek release in this way that provisions sentence on release states that all this is subject to an exception that is set out in  1226c he continued xa0Congress mandated that aliens who were thought to pose a heightened risk be arrested and detained without a chance to apply for release on bond or parole Respondents in the two cases before us are aliens who were detained under  1226c2s mandatorydetention requirementand thus denied a bond hearingpending a decision on their removal the Court explained Though all respondents had been convicted of criminal offenses covered in  1226c1AD none were arrested by immigration officials immediately after their release from criminal custody Indeed some were not arrested until several years later Alito noted that although the plaintiffs in these cases were taken into custody years after their prison time was finished the federal trial courts in California and Western Washington certified a broad class comprising all aliens in who are or will be subjected to mandatory detention  and who were not  taken into custody by the government immediately upon their release from criminal custody Paragraph 1 provides that the Secretary shall take into custody any alien having certain characteristics Alito reasoned diving into a very dense and detailed examination of the statutes text and that the Secretary must do this when the alien is released from criminal custody Rejecting the ACLUs argument that this provision means that the government has authority to detain the alien only if agents arrest him immediately upon release from prison Alito declared that such an interpretation would be downright incoherent Not only would such a reading be inconsistent with the statute it would also violate rules of basic grammar The majority quoted a scholarly legal work from their recently departed colleague quoting Justice Antonin Scalia where he wrote that rules of grammar govern statutory interpretation unless they contradict legislative intent or purpose In this case they all point in the same direction Alito went on to quote the Courts precedents to cast aside the idea that  1226cs language allows detention only if agents arrest the alien immediately upon release saying as we have held time and again an officials crucial duties are better carried out late than never Or more precisely a statutory rule that officials shall act within a specified time does not by itself preclude action later This principle for interpreting time limits on statutory mandates was a fixture of the legal backdrop when Congress enacted  1226c he noted Congress was presumably aware that we do not readily infer congressional intent to limit an agencys power to get a mandatory job done merely from a specification to act by a certain time Especially hard to swallow is respondents insistence that for an alien to be subject to mandatory detention under  1226c the alien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail though respondents allow that it need not be at the jailhouse doorthe parking lot or bus stop would do Alito continued Assessing the situation in realistic and practical terms it is inevitable that respondents unsparing deadline will often be missed for reasons beyond the Federal Governments control Then the Court majority flagged sanctuary cities in what may bode well for the ongoing legal challenges on that front To give just one example state and local officials sometimes rebuff the Governments request that they give notice when a criminal alien will be released Alito also noted that another part of  1226c mandates holding persons with terrorist ties who have never been put in state prison and thus they would not trigger this mandatorydetention power at all if the Ninth Circuits interpretation were correct Under the Court of Appeals reading the mandatorydetention scheme would be gentler on terrorists than it is on gardenvariety offenders he reasoned Yet this subparagraph covers the very sort of aliens for which Congress was most likely to have wanted to require mandatory detention The same would be true for aliens who necessarily escape conviction those for whom immunity from criminal jurisdiction was exercised he continued In the end a fivejustice majority accepted the Trumps adiministrations arguments reversing the Ninth Circuit Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion fully joining Alitos opinion but also writing separately to clarify the scope of the Courts decision in one of his first significant standalone opinions The sole question before us is narrow whether under  1226 the Executive Branchs mandatory duty to detain a particular noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody remains mandatory if the Executive Branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody  It would be odd in my view if the Act 1 mandated detention of particular noncitizens because the noncitizens posed such a serious risk of danger or flight that they must be detained during their removal proceedings but 2 nonetheless allowed the noncitizens to remain free during their removal proceedings if the Executive Branch failed to immediatelyxa0detain them upon their release from criminal custody Justice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion concurring in part joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch I continue to believe that no court has jurisdiction to decide questions concerning the detention of aliens before final orders of removal have been entered Thomas wrote citing several statutory provisions that he believed deprived federal judges of the authority to review these detention determinations Thomas then added that seven of the nine justices believed they did have jurisdiction and with that being a decision of the Court he and Gorsuch joined most of Alitos opinion siding with the US government Justice Stephen Breyer dissented joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Even the liberal justices rejected the ACLUs argument that aliens go scotfree if they are not arrested within 24 hours but argued that the arrest must take place within one year They argued that if a criminal alien can evade federal agents for 13 months then the mandatorydetention provision would not apply Otherwise they contended  1226c would likely be unconstitutional Alito and the Court majority rejected that contention arguing that there was no time limit on how long Congress could authorize the government to hold an alien while their deportation case progressed The case is Nielsen v Preap

fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction WMD The deadly synthetic opioid mainly originates in China and is the top driver of the unprecedented number of fatal drug overdoses in the United States an internal memo obtained by Task  Purpose revealed this week Several experts as well as current and former US officials including some from DHS have repeatedly warned that terrorists could potentially weaponize fentanyl  118 pounds of which is reportedly enough to kill 25 million peoplexa0 A little as two to three milligrams of fentanyl can induce respiratory depression respiratory arrest and possibly death And some fentanyl analogues such as carfentanil are orders of magnitude more potent the February 22 memo from James McDonnell the assistant secretary at DHS for countering weapons of mass destruction noted McDonnell wrote that there is a general consensus among national security and military officials that fentanyl in certain configurations has properties that make it a chemical with the potential for mass casualty effects Within the past couple years there has been a reinvigorated interest in addressing fentanyl and its analogues as WMD materials due to the ongoing opioid crisis he added referring to the drug overdoses that have killed tens of thousands in recent years The Trump administration would deem fentanyl a WMD when certain criteria related to the quantity and configuration of the drug are met McDonnell wrote in the document titled Use of counterWMD authorities to combat fentanyl Some configurations are more lethal than others McDonnell prepared the memo for thenDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stressing Fentanyls high toxicity and increasing availability are attractive to threat actors seeking nonconventional materials for a chemical weapons attack In July 2018 the FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate assessed that fentanyl is very likely a viable option for a chemical weapon attack by extremists or criminals McDonnell noted that his office could assist DHS in combating fentanyl trafficking by managing and developing new technologies deploying sensors and assisting authorities in the field He asserted that senior leaders in the US Department of Defense DOD such as Navy Adm Craig Faller commander of US Southern Command SOCOM had proposed formally designating fentanyl as a WMD material In its latest annual summary of its activities provided to Congress earlier this year SOUTHCOM expressed concern about the flow of fentanyl into the United Statesxa0 American officials believe the synthetic drug primarily originates in China and to a lesser extent Latin America where traffickers are known to get the precursor chemicals from the Asian giantxa0 SOUTHCOM which oversees US military activity in most of Latin America and the Caribbean reported in its annual summaryxa0 In addition to cocaine traffickers also transport heroin synthetic opioids like fentanyl and precursor chemicals from China While Mexico remains the primary source for heroin smuggled into the US and China the prime source of fentanyl the Dominican Republic is emerging as a regional transit point for opioid trafficking into major US cities like Philadelphia Boston and Miami US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently told lawmakers that Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has failed to keep his promise to Trump that his administration will stop the flow of Chinese fentanyl into the United Statesxa0 Task  Purpose acknowledged that DHS and SOUTHCOM did not respond to requests for comment on the memo Other DHS officials have warned that in the wrong hands synthetic opioids such as fentanyl can be an effective weapon capable of killing millionsxa0 Referring toxa0Carfentanil axa0deadly synthetic opioid drug believed to be a hundred times more toxic than fentanylxa0Peter Ostrovsky then the assistant special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE agency said in 2016 Could it be weaponized Yeah it could be weaponized We dont have any information thats indicating to us that carfentanil will be weaponized But just let your imagination run wild and you can see that somebody could use it as a weapon he added according to Global News ICE is a component of DHS In March 2018 Sen Tom Cotton RAR echoing other lawmakers proclaimedxa0fentanyl is as much a weapon of mass destruction as it is a drug Moreover Daniel Gerstein a senior policy researcher at Rand Corp who served as acting undersecretary in the DHS Science and Technology Directorate during the previous administration indicated to Bloomberg News this year that fentanyl can be used as as a tool of terrorxa0 Josh Bloom a senior director of chemical and pharmaceutical research at the American Council on Science and Health added If groundup fentanyl is placed on everyday objects people could easily put their fingers in their mouths or rub their eyes and have a deadly reactionxa0 Fentanyl is a significant threat to national security Michael Morell a former acting CIA director under former President Barack Obama wrotexa0in 2017 It is a weapon of mass destruction Despite the warnings from several independent and government officials some officials believed designating fentanyl as a WMD is unnecessaryxa0 This is like declaringxa0ecstasyxa0as a WMD a member of the Pentagons counterWMD community told Task  Purpose on condition of anonymityxa0 Unlike ecstasy however fentanyl is the primary cause of fatal drug overdoses in the United States that in 2017 proved to be more lethal than terrorist attacks across the world during that same period Breitbart News determined According to the latest data from thexa0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC opioids alone including heroin 15950 and synthetic drugs like fentanyl 29418 killed more people about 49000 than terrorist attacks 26400 fatalities across the globe in 2017xa0 Overall overdoses killed an unprecedented 72287 people in the United States in 2017 prompting the life expectancy rate to drop in the United Statesxa0 Trumps National Security Strategy NSS deemed Chinese fentanyl traffickers a top homeland security

197,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/house-vote-national-emergency-termination-trump-border-wall-2019-2,n WASHINGTON  The House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday to terminate President Donald Trumps nationalemergency declaration which allows him to reprogram federal funds for the construction of additional physical barriers along the USMexico border The vote is a stern rebuke of Trump who has prompted lawsuits and widespread criticism over his use of emergency powers to justify building his longpromised wall But in order to become vetoproof the resolution will need to gain much more Republican support which is poised to be an uphill battle for Democrats The resolution which was introduced by Democratic Rep Joaquin Castro of Texas passed by a 245182 vote Read more The lawsuits challenging Trumps national emergency declaration to build the border wall keep piling up The 13 Republicans who crossed the aisle to reject Trumps use of emergency powers were mostly moderates including Reps Elise Stefanik of New York and Will Hurd of Texas Former House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers voted in favor of the measure as did Oregon Rep Greg Walden the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee Most of the ultraconservative representatives voted against the resolution with the exception of Reps Justin Amash of Michigan and Thomas Massie of Kentucky Rep Warren Davidson the Republican who replaced former House Speaker John Boehners seat in Ohio voted for the resolution but quickly switched his vote to oppose it Additionally Republican Rep John Katko of New York did not vote The resolution had more than 200 Democratic cosponsors but just one who is Republican Amash who criticized his fellow Republicans who have decided to back Trumps decision as hypocritical The same congressional Republicans who joined me in blasting Pres Obamas executive overreach now cry out for a king to usurp legislative powers he wrote on Twitter If your faithfulness to the Constitution depends on which party controls the White House then you are not faithful to it House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pledged his full support for the emergency declaration in advance of Trumps decision earlier in February McCarthy told reporters that he believes Republicans would by and large stand together in defense of the president adding I dont think anyone questions his legal authority to declare a national emergency As for Senate Republicans few have mustered the energy to rebuke Trump on the issue Sen Thom Tillis of North Carolina penned an oped for The Washington Post on Monday announcing he would back a resolution like the one the House passed There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that theres an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach  that its acceptable for my party but not thy party Tillis wrote As a US senator I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress he added As a conservative I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future leftwing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms Sen Susan Collins of Maine went as far as to back the lawsuit against the declaration brought forth by California and 15 other states I would not be at all surprised if the courts find that the presidents action is contrary to the separation of powers she said in an interview with a Maine NBC affiliate I dont think under the Constitution that he can unilaterally decide to move these funds which were legally appropriated from one project to anotherxa0 Many Democrats have condemned Trumps decision as an abuse of power and a brazen executive overreach Others have suggested they should use the same authority to enact their own policy goals when the day comes that a Democrat is back in the White House You want to talk about a national emergency Lets talk about today the one year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America Thats a national emergency House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a press conference Why dont you declare that emergency Mr President I wish you would But a Democratic president can do that Democratic president can declare emergencies as well So the precedent that the President is setting here is something that should be met with great unease and dismay by the Republicans she added Democrats who are more leftleaning have advocated for a Democratic president to use the same authority to tackle issues such as global climate change Our next President should declare a NationalEmergency on day 1 to address the existential threat to all life on the planet posed by Climate Change Rep Ilhan Omar of Minnesota wrote on Twitter While the White House has reiterated that they do not believe they are creating a new precedent with the emergency declaration Democrats are not in agreement In a meeting with reporters on Tuesday House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer likened it to a constitutional crisis People will say weve had a lot of emergency declarations Well thats correct he said This is the only one  the only one  that has been used to get around a Congress refusal to appropriate money for a particular objective There is no crisis at the border Hoyer added There is a crisis now in defending our Constitution Hoyer said he is optimistic the resolution will pass both the House and the Senate and that Congress will have gained something even if it fails to have enough votes to override a presidential veto This is a vote of principle he said I think if the conscience of every member and their judgment was utilized as opposed to their political judgments it would pass overwhelmingly with a vetoproof

report that challenges what the government has said about civilian casualties from its bombing campaign against alShabab  an alQaida affiliate  in the African nation The investigation conducted by Amnesty International found that US airstrikes from both drones and manned aircraft killed at least 14 civilians and injured eight more people in just five of more than 100 strikes in the past two years The attacks appear to have violated international humanitarian law and some may amount to war crimes the Amnesty International report said The US Africa Command or Africom one of the Pentagons 10 combatant command centers worldwide repeated its denial that any civilians have been killed in its operations in Somalia when presented with Amnesty Internationals findings Read more Trump inherited Obamas drone war and hes significantly expanded it in countries where the US is not technically at war  Amnesty International conducted more than 150 interviews with eyewitnesses relatives persons displaced by the fighting and expert sources while rigorously analyzing satellite imagery munition fragments and photos from the aftermath of air strikes Amnesty could not sufficiently corroborate reports of civilian casualties in each one of the dozens of strikes in Somalia that it examined but it said in its report that the civilian death toll may well be much higher The Department of Defense and US government have not been honest about civilian casualties from its operations in Somalia Daphne Eviatar Amnesty International USAs director of security with human rights told INSIDER The US has conducted dozens of strikes in Somalia under President Donald Trump and its not clear which were done under the Pentagon versus the CIA Most drone strikes conducted by the Pentagon are required to be disclosed publicly but the US intelligence community does not operate under the same rules Africom has consistently said despite dozens of airstrikes every year that there have been zero civilian casualties in Somalia Eviatar said adding that this assertion is just not credible Amnesty International was very suspicious of the militarys consistent claims it wasnt killing any civilians in airstrikes Eviatar said Read more Trump quietly rewrote the rules of drone warfare which means the US can now kill civilians in secret Wed been getting some reports from the ground that this wasnt the case she added But we didnt know for sure until we went there and interviewed witnesses looked at a ton of evidence and realized that in fact there are children farmers and welldiggers being killed  people who are clearly not alShabab fighters The US government needs to acknowledge these civilian casualties Eviatar said adding that it looks like the military is engaging in what are known as signature strikes  strikes that target militaryage males even if the US isnt certain they have ties to militant or extremist groups Thats completely unlawful Eviatar said adding that criticism on this practice led President Barack Obama to establish new rules designed to protect civilians Read more US military says it killed roughly 60 terrorists in Somalia airstrike the deadliest in a year Trump has rolled back Obamaera rules on covert drone strikes and has overseen a drastic increase in the number of strikes in Somalia expanding the shadow wars that began under Obama Under Trump the US conducted more drone strikes in Somalia in 2017 alone than the total number conducted in the African nation during Obamas entire tenure Amnestys investigation comes on the heels of a decision from Trump to end an Obamaera rule for the US government to publicly report on civilian casualties from drone strikes The reversal of that rule indicates there will be even less transparency on a program that was already virtually entirely out of the public eye Read more Americas year in war All the places US armed forces took or gave fire in 2018 The public needs to understand that the US government really doesnt do a very good job of investigating who its killed Weve seen this repeatedly now Eviatar said We saw it in Iraq we saw it in Syria and now were seeing it in Somalia Responding to Amnestys report a senior White House official on Wednesday told INSIDER The United States Government is fully committed to complying with its obligations under the law of armed conflict to minimizing to the greatest extent possible civilian causalities and to taking appropriate action when civilian casualties unfortunately occur during military operations In fact the US government often imposes heightened policy standards that are more protective of civilians than the requirements of the law of armed conflict the official addedxa0 Experts have pointed to civilian casualties from drone strikes as a catalyst and recruiting tool for terrorism which underscores why this is an issue that strongly influences the public even though it might have little knowledge about it because of the secrecy surrounding these strikes In 2010 a man named Faisal Shahzad attempted to bomb Times Square in New York City Shahzad cited drone strikes as his inspiration n

bipartisan resolution to end US involvement in the horrific war in Yemen Democratic Rep Ro Khanna of California who spearheaded efforts on the resolution in the House told INSIDER This is very sad and a missed opportunity by the president to stand up for the Constitution He ignored the views of his allies like Rand Paul Mark Meadows and Matt Gaetz all of whom voted against endless war and these interventions After the resolution passed in the House Khanna and a bipartisan bicameral group of lawmakers wrote a letter urging Trump to sign the resolution Sen Chris Murphy of Connecticut who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in a statement This is a huge mistake The civil war in Yemen is a humanitarian crisis and we have no business still being a part of it Republicans and

weaken my constitutional authorities Trumps first veto came after Congress rebuked him and voted to block his nationalemergency declaration to obtain funding for a border wall The resolution sponsored by Sanders passed in the Senate in March and the House followed suit earlier this month Today we took a clear stand against war and famine and for Congress war powers by voting to end our complicity in the war in Yemen Sanders said in a tweet after the vote This is just the beginning of a national debate over when and where we go to war and Congress authority over those interventions The push for

politically sensitive investigation in modern US history Congress will get the report sometime between 11 am ET and noon on Thursday Before that Attorney General William Barr will hold a press conference at 930 am ET to brief reporters on an overview of the document and to answer questions about the redaction process and more Mueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017 after President Donald Trump fired thenFBI director James Comey According to a memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein outlining the scope of Muellers appointment he was tasked with investigating the following Throughout the course of the investigation the public learned through media reports and legal disclosures by the special counsels office that Mueller was investigating several threads including Trumps business ties to Russia his campaign associates links to Russia the contacts and meetings between his advisers and those linked to the Russian government Trump aides involvement in foreign lobbying activities Trumps decision to fire Comey and any other attempts to hamper the investigation the Trump Organizations push to build a Trump Tower in Moscowxa0why several Trump associates lied to

readable format  like a PDF document that allows you to search for keywords  or if it will be a paper copy scanned and uploaded Barr said the final report is nearly 400 pages Broadly the report will cover two lines of inquiry did the Trump campaign conspire with the Russian government during the 2016 election And did the president try to hamper the investigation after Comey confirmed its existence during a congressional hearing in March 2017 In a letter to Congress last month Barr said Muellers team did not find sufficient evidence to bring a conspiracy charge against Trump or anyone associated with his campaign On the obstruction question Barr said Mueller had declined to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment and deferred from drawing a conclusion one way or another But Barr in consultation with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with an obstruction offense Barr said current Justice Department policy saying that a sitting president cannot be indicted was not a factor in his decision Read more House Democrats authorize subpoena for the Mueller report teeing up an unprecedented legal battle with the DOJ Allies of the president took a victory lap after Barr released his principal conclusions to Congress But legal experts and nationalsecurity veterans say their celebration may be premature Specifically they emphasized that the prosecutorial standard for proving conspiracy is higher than the counterintelligence standard used by agencies like the CIA For that reason they believexa0Muellers final report includes details that while they may not rise to the level of criminal conduct go far beyond those included in the cursory summary Barr sent to Congress Intelligence veterans say the information Barr did not include from Muellers report could go a long way in answering many of thexa0lingering questionsxa0the public has about the myriad contacts meetings and interactions between Trump associates

stirred up some controversy on the Hill when he told Congress that he would be redacting certain categories of information from the final report The categories that will be blocked out in the public report are Last week Barr told Congress that he will include colorcoded notes for each redaction that will explain why that piece of information was left out of the version of the report delivered to Congress and the public In March Barr also revealed that nearly every page of the report contains at least some information that needs to be redacted Previous special prosecutors  like Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr and Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski  went to court to get a judges permission to release as much information to Congress and the public as they could But Barr said he will not do the same and will work according to current Justice Department policy and legal guidelines House and Senate Democrats have amped up calls for the attorney general to release to Congress a full unredacted version of Muellers report Democratic lawmakers were apoplectic about Barrs decision to hold a press conference over an hour before making the report available and said the move was designed to craft a narrative about the report that favors the president The attorney general appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a hastily arranged press conference Wednesday evening Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns about Barrs oversight of the Mueller probe from the start Those concerns stem in large part from a controversial memo Barr sent to the Justice Department and the White House last year in which he argued that Muellers obstruction probe was legally insupportable and should not be sanctioned by the Justice Department Democrats contend that Barrs memo proves he is inherently biased against a key thread in Muellers investigation and therefore his principal conclusion that Trump did not obstruct justice is not an objective legal assessment House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff and other Democrats are pushing hard for an unredacted version of the report Democrats argue that it is necessary for Congress to have all the information to properly perform its oversight functions They also say Muellers decision not to prosecute Trump does not necessarily mean he did not commit impeachable offenses The Wall Street Journal reported that once they get a redacted version of the report House Judiciary Committee lawyers and aides plan to comb through the document and determine whether there is a large gap between what they requested from the Justice Department and what the redacted copy of the report provides Based on their findings The Journal reported the committee will decide whether to subpoena the department for a full version of the report as well as its underlying evidence Republicans are increasing

senior FBI and Justice Department officials acted on antiTrump bias and launched the Russia probe to undermine his presidency Republicans also falsely claim that the FBI illegally spied on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election During a hearing before Congress last week Barr told lawmakers he had put together a team to investigate whether any unauthorized surveillance of the campaign occurred but he acknowledged there was no evidence to date suggesting it had Still Trump and his loyalists seized on Barrs remarks ahead of the reports release saying it proved the origins of the Russia probe were corrupt Last week Nunes told Fox News Sean Hannity he was privately pushing Barr to launch criminal investigations into at least eight former FBI and Justice Department officials involved in probing Trumps ties to Russia He added that he plans to meet with Barr and discuss the criminal referrals when appropriate Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham has also signaled an interest in investigating the DOJs oversight of the Russia investigation Once we put the Mueller report to bed once Barr comes to the committee and takes questions about his findings and his actions and we get to see the Mueller report consistent with law then we are going to turn to finding out how this got off the rails Graham told Fox News last month Trump celebrated when Barr released his initial review of Muellers findings claiming that they represented a complete and total exoneration of him even though Muellers team specified in their report that their findings did not exonerate Trump The president also supported releasing an unredacted copy of the report at first But his tune changed as Democrats began calling for the same and Trump later said the report should not be released at all Two people with knowledge of the matter told INSIDER on Thursday that Trumps legal team is not concerned about the redacted report being released because they dont believe it will shift public opinion against the president Indeed Rudy Giuliani Trumps lead defense lawyer told INSIDER last year that our jury is the American people He added that if Trump and his allies sowed enough doubt about the legitimacy of the Russia investigation the public would not trust Muellers findings regardless of how damaging they were and Trump would not be impeached Contrary to the Trump legal teams belief some prosecutors on Muellers team reportedly believe their findings are more dangerous to the president than Barr indicated in his initial review People familiar with the matterxa0told The Washington Post some on Muellers team believed Barrs letter on the final report downplayed the fact that the evidence they gathered on obstruction was alarming and significant Also according to The New York Times Muellers investigators wrote multiple summaries of their report and some of them believe Barr should have included more of their material in the initial fourpage letter he sent to Congress laying out his principal conclusions For the past two years Mueller ran the tightest ship in Washington DC Hisxa0office publicly broke its silence just twice during the investigation One former White House official who was previously involved in the Mueller investigation told INSIDER the public should take prosecutors decision to express their frustration about Barr seriously given whats at stake If prosecutors are concerned that their conclusions may be obscured or misrepresented  and if theyre worried enough that theyre talking about it to other people  thats something everyone needs to take seriously regardless of whose side youre on the former official added n                          Keep readingn                        ,0

Russia investigation and has pledged to tell Congress the truth in a series of hearings this week Reports Tuesday suggested Cohen was telling investigators about his previous lies to them BuzzFeed

statement disputing unspecified elements of that report BuzzFeed News stands by its story and the two law enforcement sources who informed it MIchael Cohen testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday the first of three days of congressional testimony on Capitol Hill this week Lanny Davis one of Cohens attorneys called Gaetzs tweet a new low in a statement We will not respond to Mr Gaetzs despicable lies and personal smears except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House both Republicans and Democrats will repudiate his words Davis said Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about when discussions related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal ended Special counsel Robert Mueller who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election noted that Cohens false claim that the project discussions concluded in January 2016 was an attempt to minimize links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1  widely understood to be Trump  in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations He apologized Sen Dianne Feinstein a Democratic member of the committee said of Cohen on Tuesday He said hes going away he understands and I think he made

This is what it looks like to compete in the marketplace of ideas he said A Gaetz spokesperson told BuzzFeed News Tuesday evening the congressmans tweet spoke for itself Democrats have already accused Trump of trying to intimidate Cohen before his testimony to Congress Cohen canceled his first scheduled public appearance before the Oversight Committee because of what Davis described as threats against Cohens family The cancellation followed a tweet from Trump accusing Cohen of lying to get a reduced sentence Watch fatherinlaw Trump added Trump has also previously called Cohen a rat  a

Oversight Committee said Im focused on making sure that the American people hear what Mr Cohen has to say I have razor focus on that Thats it Cummings also said he hadnt spoken to Gaetz about the tweet adding For what A spokesperson for Twitter which can suspend accounts for threatening behavior said its rules likely wouldnt apply here because the tweet didnt contain a violent threat I dont

211,BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/trump-lawsuit-dc-hotel-profit-emoluments-justice-department,An appeals court heard arguments Tuesday in a case over whether Trump is violating the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses of the US Constitution by refusing to divest in his businesses BuzzFeed News Reporter Reporting From Trump International Hotel in Washington DC RICHMOND Virginia  President Donald Trumps personal lawyers and attorneys from the Justice Department argued Tuesday that no one should be able to sue Trump for profiting from his businesses while hes in office  and for the first time in more than a year things went well for the president in the case The US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by Maryland and the District of Columbia accusing Trump of violating the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses of the US Constitution by refusing to give up his interest in the Trump International Hotel in Washington To date a federal judge in Maryland has repeatedly ruled against Trump But the threejudge 4th Circuit panel expressed deep skepticism Tuesday about DCs and Marylands positions on a host of issues including what exactly they wanted a judge to order Trump to do whether claims that Trumps hotel had an unfair competitive advantage were too speculative and whether DC and Maryland  or anyone for that matter  could bring a lawsuit against a president under the emoluments clauses The attorney general offices in DC and Maryland sued Trump in June 2017 arguing that when foreign state or local officials patronize Trumps businesses the president profits and receives a prohibited emolument The word emolument is generally defined as a financial benefit but the definition is one of the major issues in dispute The judge in Maryland US District Judge Peter Messitte agreed with DC and Marylands broad interpretation and rejected the Justice Departments position that it should only cover money that a public official received in exchange for official acts or an employeremployee arrangement The 4th Circuit  which is based in Richmond Virginia but covers federal courts in Maryland Virginia the Carolinas and West  could order the case dismissed entirely but there are other possible outcomes that would still represent a win for Trump At a minimum the Justice Department is arguing the 4th Circuit should allow an appeal to go forward on earlier rulings from Messitte which would delay DCs and Marylands efforts to pursue dozens of subpoenas theyve issued against Trumps businesses Messitte declined to give approval for an appeal at this stage and allowed the subpoenas to go out Justice Department attorney Hashim Mooppan focused his arguments Tuesday on urging the court to toss the case outright arguing there was no legal authority for anyone to sue the president under the emoluments clauses If no one could sue the president for accepting prohibited emoluments Judge Dennis Shedd asked Wheres the check on the president Mooppan replied that any sort of action against the president at least had to be authorized by Congress and that had not happened Mooppan also argued that the president presented a special situation and left open the question of whether someone could file this type of lawsuit against a lowerranking public official Loren AliKhan DCs solicitor general argued first for DC and Maryland Judge Paul Niemeyer pressed AliKhan to explain what official action by Trump was at issue He said Trump had scaled back his involvement in his business empire and turned over management to his sons and asked if that meant Trump was only passively holding the financial interests at issue AliKhan replied that Trump made a decision to keep his business holdings which offered a way for foreign governments to offer emoluments and for the president to accept them Shedd and Niemeyer grew frustrated that AliKhan would not provide a definite answer on what type of injunction they wanted a judge to impose on Trump  AliKhan said that an order requiring him to divest in the hotel would be one possible outcome but it was too early to say what would be appropriate and they wanted to leave it up to the lower court judge Shedd and Niemeyer asked if having Trump put his assets in a blind trust would be appropriate and when AliKhan replied that it could be the two judges pushed back questioning how it could satisfy DC and Maryland if Trump were still getting any profit from his businesses You seem to be ducking the question Niemeyer said AliKhan said DC and Maryland would also be satisfied with a declaration from a judge saying that the president was in violation of the clauses leaving it open how exactly he could come into compliance Shedd mused whether such a declaration would be grounds for impeachment The judges questioned the broad interpretation of emolument adopted by DC and Maryland Judge A Marvin Quattlebaum Jr asked if a public official who had a bank account insured by the US government would violate the emoluments clauses since they were receiving a benefit in the form of protected assets Shedd posed the same question about an official who held US Treasury bills AliKhan said the emoluments clauses covered profits and advantages not financial instruments where an official didnt exercise discretion over the benefits they received AliKhan said it crossed the line when the president received profits and actively solicited business from foreign governments Shedd asked if DC and Marylands interpretation would only protect career politicians AliKhan replied that public officials who come in with certain types of assets were generally instructed to place them into a blind trust which prompted a whole new round of questions from the judges about how a blind trust would satisfy DC and Maryland Shedd asked if a court could order that no person associated with a foreign government could stay at a Trump property AliKhan said it would depend on the wording Shedd then wondered if that scenario was similar to Trumps executive actions banning people from certain countries  predominantly majorityMuslim nations  from coming to the United States Shedd asked If Trump said no foreigners could stay at his hotel how quickly would Maryland sue for discrimination AliKhan replied that the case wasnt about foreigners but about foreign governments The court heard arguments first on DCs and Marylands claims against Trump in his official capacity as president The lawsuit was later updated to add a claim against Trump in his individual capacity but DC and Maryland decided not to press it However Trumps personal lawyers were in court Tuesday to argue that the 4th Circuit should issue an order barring DC and Maryland from trying to sue Trump individually in the future William Consovoy Trumps personal attorney argued that the president on an individual basis should be completely immune from this sort of lawsuit Niemeyer questioned whether the court should get into the substance of Consovoys arguments at all if DC and Maryland were dropping the claim However the judges got into a tense backandforth with Maryland Assistant Attorney General Leah Tulin about whether there was a chance DC and Maryland might try to sue Trump individually in the future Tulin said they did not plan on it but she argued they werent required to commit to never bringing it again Shedd said Trump probably felt there was a risk that he would be sued personally in the future which Shedd said he understood and asked Tulin why DC and Maryland wouldnt take it off the table Tulin repeated that there was no requirement under the rules and that the judge was asking her to answer a question about internal litigation strategy Tulin said that if DC and Maryland tried to bring individual claims against Trump in the future Trump could raise various challenges that a judge would have to address first Shedd who throughout the hearing questioned how Messitte had handled the case and whether hed tried to dictate how DC and Maryland pursued it said to Consovoy You dont think you would win Consovoy replied that he was an optimist Consovoy argued that DC and Marylands claims  that Trumps hotel had an unfair advantage and hurt other local hotels and venues  were too speculative In response Shedd wondered whether the fact that Trump inspired so many protests against him in DC had in fact helped other hotels in the region It wasnt speculation to say that people coming to protest Trump werent booking rooms at Trumps hotel the judge quipped At the end of arguments as is tradition in the 4th Circuit the judges came down from the bench to shake hands with the lawyers As Shedd shook Tulins hand he asked Was it fun He then laughed and answered his own question for her Not so much BuzzFeed News Reporter Contact Zoe Tillman at zoetillmanbuzzfeedcom Got a confidential tip  Submit it here,-1

218,BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/dominicholden/trump-transgender-military-ban-still-on-hold-judge,Defendants were incorrect says a decision from US District Court Judge Colleen KollarKotelly BuzzFeed News Reporter The Trump administration was wrong to claim last week it could begin to implement a ban on transgender troops Judge Colleen KollarKotelly said in a decision issued Tuesday that rebuked officials for insisting a court order blocking the ban since 2017 had been lifted Defendants were incorrect in claiming that there was no longer an impediment says KollarKotellys notice in US District Court in Washington DC Defendants remain bound by this Courts preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo The decision makes clear the Pentagon may not yet implement a ban on transgender troops despite several claims by the Justice Department last week that it was free of any blockade on enacting new policy to block transgender recruits from the armed forces The administration released a memo last week saying that it planned to enact the ban next month after the Justice Department said in a court filing there is no longer any impediment that stopped them from doing so We are grateful for the district courts clarity in stating unequivocally that the injunction against the transgender military ban remains in place Jennifer Levi an attorney for GLBTQ Legal Advocates  Defenders a group representing the challengers told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday Levi and other lawyers challenging the ban had argued Trump officials were running roughshod over courts when they issued the ban last week Plaintiffs will continue to challenge the governments efforts to reinstate an unfair and discriminatory policy against transgender people Levi added And for now the military cannot take any adverse action against transgender troops or recruits who meet all current standards of service Still it wasnt immediately clear if KollarKotellys decision would change a timeline to implement the ban which the Pentagon said will take effect on April 12 due to pending action from an appeals court The underlying legal situation is complicated The case is one of four in which judges issued nationwide injunctions that blocked the policy from being implemented Courts had lifted three of the injunctions while all of the legal challenges continue  though the status of this fourth injunction in the DC court was disputed The Justice Department argued that when the DC Court of Appeals vacated the injunction in January it ceased to exist and the Pentagon was free to instate a ban LGBT advocacy lawyers countered that the appellate court still hadnt issued a mandate to lift the injunction because a series of procedural steps had to first be undertaken while the plaintiffs decide to request a rehearing The Trump administration issued its memo to set up the ban anyway That led to Tuesdays decision from KollarKotelly On October 30 2017 this Court ordered Defendants to maintain the status quo as it relates to the accession and retention of transgender individuals in the military she said That preliminary injunction remains in place until the DC Circuit issues its mandate vacating the preliminary injunction The plaintiffs in the DC court have until March 29 to request a rehearing before the full bench of judges at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals Doing so could extend the timeline for the injunction to remain in place In June 2016 the Obama administration lifted a decadeslong ban on transgender people serving in the armed forces after finding they wouldnt harm the military Trump reversed that decision in 2017 saying that transgender people would render the military burdened with medical costs and disruption Trump formalized his policy in a memorandum that August  but courts issued preliminary injunctions putting Trumps ambitions on hold In an effort to bypass those injunctions Trumps policy evolved in February 2018 when former defense secretary James Mattis recommended banning most transgender personnel but allowing those whod already joined and transitioned to remain in the ranks which was the blueprint for the ban released this month BuzzFeed News Reporter Dominic Holden is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York  Contact Dominic Holden at dominicholdenbuzzfeedcom Got a confidential tip  Submit it here,0
219,BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/measles-outbreaks-new-normal,Undervaccinated areas in the US are the kindling and the huge numbers of infections overseas are the spark that ignites outbreaks here BuzzFeed News Reporter A sign warns people of measles in the ultraOrthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg Brooklyn Expect even more measles outbreaks in the United States in coming years public health experts say thanks to overseas epidemics and growing misinformation efforts by antivaccination activists Outbreaks of the highly contagious virus are now active in 20 states with 555 confirmed cases in the US this year alone according to the CDC Thats well on track to exceed 2014s record of 667 cases the highest number recorded since the disease was declared domestically eradicated in 2000 All of the new US outbreaks originally derived from infections transmitted by travelers  either visitors from overseas or US residents who went abroad Every case we have now is associated with travel Thomas Clark deputy director of the CDCs viral diseases division told BuzzFeed News And with measles cases now surging outside of the US too  seeing a 300 global increase this year compared to last  we are likely to see more cases here public health experts say It is unfortunately the new normal Harvard Medical School epidemiologist John Brownstein told BuzzFeed News And the booming antivaccine movement in the US and across the world is making it harder to keep it in check he said On Monday the World Health Organization reported that 170 countries have confirmed more than 112000 cases so far in 2019 Thats probably an underestimate as only about 1 in 10 actual cases is reported to the WHO Severe outbreaks in countries such as Madagascar the Philippines and Ukraine among others are causing many deaths  mostly among young children according to the health agency Those epidemics are leading to outbreaks even in countries with good overall vaccination rates such as Israel Thailand and the US Absolutely what we are seeing is that undervaccinated areas in the US are the kindling and the huge numbers of infections overseas are the spark that ignites outbreaks here Baylor College of Medicine infectious disease expert Peter Hotez told BuzzFeed News Measles is largely preventable by vaccination which stops transmission of the disease after a second dose in 97 of cases and lessens its severity in rare cases that slip through But the virus is highly contagious If exposed to someone with the virus 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people will get sick themselves That means communities need to have a high rate of overall vaccination around 95 to provide herd immunity to the disease About half of the US outbreaks have happened in closeknit religious or ethnic communities said Clark that can be insular or for whatever reason resistant to vaccination The biggest US outbreak nearly 300 reported cases in New York City has largely struck the ultraOrthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn for example and traces to an outbreak in Israel That Brooklyn community and another Jewish group in Rockland County New York where 180 cases have been reported were targeted by antivaccination propaganda efforts according to local public health officials another growing factor in the outbreaks US measles cases Measles kills about 2 in 1000 of its victims and leads to pneumonia in about 6 of cases It can cause miscarriages and is especially dangerous to infants too young for a vaccination The jab has prevented an estimated 936000 deaths from 1994 to 2018 and overall more than 91 of US kids are vaccinated against measles There is no evidence linking vaccination to autism as some vaccine critics claim most recently debunked in a study of 657000 Danish children Hotez says that online merchants such as Amazon which tops its search categories for books about vaccines with ones making bogus claims about their dangers and social media networks such as Facebook are spurring measles outbreaks by promoting antivax propaganda A book he wrote about his daughters autism Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachels Autism My Journey as a Vaccine Scientist Pediatrician and Autism Dad is ranked below 20 antivaccine books in the vaccine category on Amazon he said Thats how I know What author doesnt check his Amazon rank We need these online outfits to take steps for more than just show or the optics to stop this antivaccination propaganda that is making people sick he said Last year Hotez and colleagues reported that 15 US cities mainly in Western states have communities with a high number of unvaccinated kindergartners We are seeing outbreaks in eight of those now he said Given the higher risks of measles outbreaks he said its time to end nonmedical or religious exemptions for vaccination allowed in most states We have found that the easier it is to get an exemption the lower the vaccination rate said Clark of the CDC But public health agencies have to walk a line in reaching out to communities that are resistant to vaccination he added During an outbreak increased public attention  such as New Yorks new 1000 fines for failing to vaccinate in certain zip codes  can boost rates But we cant come in as outsiders and tell people what to do and build trust with them he said That requires a lot more careful longterm work

222,BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tariniparti/democratic-donors-2020-candidates,A BuzzFeed News analysis shows that donors are willing to give to multiple Democratic presidential candidates suggesting that voters arent worried about a drawnout primary BuzzFeed News Reporter BuzzFeed News Reporter About 1600 donors have given more than 200 to multiple Democratic presidential candidates this year with the largest overlap existing among donors who gave to both Kamala Harris and at least one other campaign In all more than 700 donors gave to Harriss campaign and at least one other Approximately 170 donors gave more than 200 to both Harriss and Pete Buttigiegs campaigns and roughly 166 gave to both Cory Bookers and Harriss campaigns according to a BuzzFeed News analysis of the latest presidential fundraising numbers which were filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday and cover the first three months of this year The data along with interviews with some of the donors reflects an engaged Democratic base that is keeping an early and close eye on the 2020 race and suggests that voters are not too concerned about a drawnout primary There was also significant overlap between donors who gave to both Beto ORourke and Buttigieg and those who gave to both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders according to the analysis And although Sanders had the largest number of disclosed donors in the first quarter only roughly 300 of them overlapped with any other campaign Thats about the same number as Booker who reported onethird as many donors The data and analysis do not include the smallestdollar donors campaigns are not required to report contributors who have given a total of 200 or less And because Joe Biden is not yet a declared presidential candidate and has not officially raised any money he wasnt included in the analysis For the data code and methodology supporting the analysis click here Approximately 44 donors gave to the campaigns of three or more women candidates in an election cycle that has seen the most diverse presidential field in history Ellen Burns of Wellesley Massachusetts gave to four women  Amy Klobuchar Kirsten Gillibrand Harris and Warren  even though she already has a favorite Im all in on Kirsten Gillibrand I think she has the potential to go toetotoe with President Donald Trump in a way that will be effective Burns said adding that she still wants American voters to get used to hearing from more women candidates Im a little disappointed that the female candidates are just not getting the support they deserve Some crossover donors were eager to see several candidates make it to at least the debate stage this summer Candidates need to meet a donor threshold to qualify for the debates I want to make sure we have people on the debate stage who have good ideas and that they arent drowned out by the same people who have been around said Jonathan Dana a Washington DCbased lawyer who has given to Jay Inslee Klobuchar Gillibrand and Buttigieg I dont think its too early right now to have a robust debate and see someone who is very young like Mayor Pete compete with someone like Biden Dana said he supported Sanders in 2016 but now he believes the party needs a new voice His time has come and gone but yet hes sucking up a lot of the money With nearly 10 months to go before the Iowa caucuses donors said they were in no rush to whittle down the expanding Democratic field I think they are all credible candidates said Robert Brady of Riverside Connecticut who has given to four candidates so far Warren Harris Buttigieg and Gillibrand Brady said he has different reasons for supporting each of the four but overall believes their values line up with his They are all smart principled people and they stand up for their values  every one of them Brady said The general election campaign is going to be brutal and is going to require somebody of inordinate toughness to stand up to the shouting and screaming and they all have that resilience Brady is one of roughly 270 donors who gave more than 200 to three or more Democratic candidates between January and March About a dozen of those donors have given to five or more candidates They include Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes and his husband Sean Eldridge a former House candidate and now a political activist Hollywood producer Andrew Mellett and entrepreneur Pedro TorresMackie Sara Garcia a Californiabased lawyer gave 500 each to Harris Warren and Buttigieg in the first quarter The batch of candidates varies so greatly in their backgrounds life experiences and level political office experience Garcia said Diversity is our strength as a party and I want to see the best woman or man for the job get the nomination which to me means hearing from everyone So I support multiple candidates to do my small part to contribute to their resources to get their message heard Many of the donors who have given to multiple campaigns have also not yet reached the maximum contribution of 2800 for each of the candidates they are supporting And some said they were still debating backing more candidates I havent finished writing checks Brady said I dont think Pete Buttigiegs name was misspelled in an earlier version of this post BuzzFeed News Reporter Tarini Parti is a politics reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based

2019n n Depending on your political view the Green New Deal looks like either the salvation or bane of the US economyxa0The proposal promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions to zero with a side of social initiatives including jobs and health care for all Given its sweep its not surprising that critics are blasting the plan as socialist The label may not be fair in a literal sense but it points to a vital question of how to best care for both the planet and its people at a time when climate change has rising urgency Is the answer more capitalism or less Whats the best path to move the United States toward an emissionsfree future For most voters the answer has as much to do with their economic worldview as their ideas about the environment The Green New Deal is drawing attention in part because the polarized responses to it are pushing that discussion to the fore Some voters would prefer a lighter touch approach such as taxing emissions and letting markets innovate in response Others say the Green New Deal neednt harm the economy Decarbonizing our economy is going to create a ton of jobs says Martin Hayden of the group Earthjustice in Washington DC There is real genuine opportunity for economic growth The plan calls for a vast remaking of the US economy In just 10 years it envisions a phaseout of all greenhouse gas emissions from power plants Ditto for cars on the road Meanwhile massive spending on highspeed rail systems would coax longdistance travelers off airplanes and onto trains Oh and while all that is slashing greenhouse gas emissions to zero this legislation would also seek to fix a host of social ills with the promise of things like jobs and health care for all Absent from the legislation are references to things like incentives markets or privatesector innovation Welcome to the Green New Deal which depending on your view looks like either the salvation or bane of the US economy Whats the best path to move the United States toward an emissionsfree future For most voters the answer has as much to do with their economic worldview as their ideas about the environment Given its sweep its not surprising that critics are blasting the plan as socialist The label may not be fair in a literal sense but it points to a vital question of how to best care for both the planet and its people at a time when climate change has rising urgency Is the answer more capitalism or lessxa0 The Green New Deal is drawing attention in part because the polarized responses to it are pushing that discussion to the forexa0 It seems like a biggovernment kind of approach says Yoram Bauman a Utahbased economist who has been active inxa0the politics of climate change But to call it socialism he adds is up to the eye of the beholder For his part he says addressing climate change is so urgent and the difficulty of passing national legislation on the issue so great that he welcomes any and all efforts to put proposals forward to see which might fly At the very least the Green New Deal is bringing heightened focus to the climate issue and stirring deeper debate about how to tackle the problemxa0It comes as some others in Congress are pitching a more marketdriven approach taxing carbon emissions to deter the use of fossil fuels while recycling the revenue back to taxpayers in the form of dividend checks So even if the Green New Deal fails legislatively itll be a chapter in a longer story And it might already be shifting what analysts have called the Overton window of what ideas are seen as feasible  in this case on an issue where gridlock has long been the normxa0 I think an open question is whether the moves on the left more recently are sort of moving the Overton window to where these carbon taxes become seen as a centrist businessoriented approach that can gain favor says Daniel Cohan an associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston To many economists the idea of carbon pricing is the most efficient way to tackle greenhouse gas emissions It would create antipollution incentives while leaving consumers and businesses free to find the least costly paths toward a clean economy And by recycling the revenue into carbon dividends for taxpayers proponents hope the plan could become politically popular with bipartisan support rather than being seen as a drag on the economy and on personal incomes But proponents of the Green New Deal say their ideas dont preclude some form of the carbon dividend scheme and have the virtue of steering the economy more aggressively toward zero net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 Thats the target set by scientists at the United Nationsbacked Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC To many voters who care about climate change that ambitious targetsetting is exactly whats needed We need to understand this is an issue that merits a wartime mobilization says Robert Larson a resident of Columbus Ohio whos working on a PhD in history He says he appreciates that Alexandria OcasioCortez the newly mintedxa0congresswoman from New York who has become Democrats leading champion for the Green New Deal has been framing the legislation in that light The scientists at the IPCC for their part have warned that warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe widespread and irreversible impacts globally unless the world acts collectively to halt the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere So far even now that theres an actual bill in Congress the Green New Deal is more a vision statement than a detailed climate action plan But it has rapidly gained fans on the left even as Republican officials have jeered at it Numerous Democratic aspirants for the 2020 presidential nomination are backers including Sens Kamala Harris of California Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey among others But many establishment Democrats have refrained from jumping on the bandwagon including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Californiaxa0 January polling by Rasmussen Reports found 81 percent of likely Democratic voters favor a Green New Deal that would focus on climate change income inequality and racial injusticexa0Among Republicans 63 percent said they were opposed while unaffiliated voters were roughly evenly split 38 percent in favor and 41 percent opposed By attaching New Deal to Green framers of the plan arexa0casting climate change as both an environmental and a social justice issue an echo ofxa0the way Franklin Roosevelts New Deal aimed atxa0social justice as well as ending the Great Depression Our first concern is solving the problem and we define the problem  more broadly than climate change said Rhiana GunnWright of New Consensus a policy nonprofit thats helping to shape the Green New Deal at a recent climatechange discussion in New Yorkxa0 The framing as a 21st century New Deal could help galvanize voters support on an environmental issue that while on their radar isnt often at the top of their priority list But it also carries political risks On the one hand to voters wary of capitalisms flaws and excesses it could signal something too tentative If the Green New Deal is going to do what the old New Deal did which is to try to save capitalism by softening the problems around it then I do not think that it will really stave off catastrophe says Mr Larson who is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America DSA in Columbus Its not that Larson favors socialism in the form a staterun economy his preference is for something more like Scandinavianstyle democratic socialism But he lacks faith that light regulation or harnessing market forces will be effective at the rapid decarbonization that the climate problem calls for On the other hand many Americans dont want to see a larger federal government and the Green New Deal looks like a case study in that risk I dont think central planning is a good way to address climate issues says Michael Rieger a selfdescribed moderate libertarian in Ann Arbor Mich who cares about global warming but also about economic growth The Green New Deal plan is vague on many fronts It calls for big public investments and refers to an appropriate level of public ownership It doesnt overtly call for state control of industries but such provisions plus the plans array of social welfare goals have drawn fire from conservatives The more control you put into the hands of a few people the more volatile its going to be and the more politically divisive predicts Mr Rieger a young voter whos preparing to enter law school in the fall In Ohio Larson worries that freemarket approaches could fail to slash greenhouse emissions fast enough and he says society needs to accept some economic sacrifice  just as Americans made in World War II  to get there By contrast Reiger in Michigan is wary that that the Green New Deal could result in bureaucratic fiefdoms that stifle democracy innovation and prosperity Those contrasting views represent the political needle that climate policy will have to thread Where the Green New Deal has energized the left the idea of a carbon dividends plan has won endorsements from bipartisan sources including former cabinet officials Federal Reserve chairs Nobel laureate economists and current members of Congress Advocates of harnessing market forces say sustaining economic growth is crucial to maintain political support for climate action And they say a price on carbon can be effective at reducing emissions if its tried on a sustained economywide basis I dont think we need to fundamentally rewrite the rules of the economy to aim for net zero emissions says Joseph Majkut a policy expert at the freemarket oriented Niskanen Center in Washington DC Im not saying that its a small transition he says but Americans can check on a carbon tax every five years to see its results and potentially adjust it if neededxa0 But in practice even middleoftheroad policy ideas have had trouble succeeding politically Mr Bauman the economist in Salt Lake City found that out when he spearheaded an unsuccessful attempt to pass a carbon tax in Washington State in 2016 And many experts argue that in the end creating a clean economy will require a blend of policies not just carbon taxesxa0 Get stories that empower and uplift

Loading nMarch 19 2019n n Perhaps more than any other US sector the lobster industry has been buffeted by tariffs Over the past two years lobster dealers have been undercut first when the European Union dropped tariffs on Canadian live lobsters but not on US ones and then last June when dealers got hit by Chinese duties part of Beijings retaliation for Trump administration tariffs against China In the meantime Trump tariffs on steel imports have squeezed Riverdale Mills the nations biggest producer of lobster trapsxa0James Knott Riverdales CEO has reduced his workforce raised some prices and seen longtime clients hedge their bets splitting their orders between his company and EU competitors So what happens if tariffs instead of being a shortlived negotiating tool become a permanent part of a USChina trade agreement ready to be reinvoked if the US believes China is misbehavingxa0As the lobster industry shows theyll create new winners and losers based on nationality rather than competitiveness Says Mr Knott Theres a lot of uncertainty Rising trade barriers since 2017 havent shown much effect on the overall US economy But tariffs do have consequences We dived into the chilly trade waters of one industry to learn more A gritty gray mist rises from the ground floor of Riverdale Mills interrupted by explosions of color yellow reds and blues  as if someone had tried to merge this Northbridge Massachusetts steelmesh maker with pieces of a Crayola factory This is Americas biggest producer of lobster traps and crab pots with their colorful PVC coatings to protect them from the seawater but CEO James Knott Jr has seen his profit margins and his employee base dwindle over the past nine months because of US steel tariffs My main competitors are out of China and the EU and they dont have any tariffs he says We get out of line with the world market and we are in trouble Rising trade barriers since 2017 havent shown much effect on the overall US economy But tariffs do have consequences We dived into the chilly trade waters of one industry to learn more Tariffs are key to President Donald Trumps trade strategy The administration has used them to help out domestic producers of everything from steel to washing machines and solar panels And it has used tariffs on all manner of Chinese goods to prod Beijing to the negotiation table But its now becoming clear that tariffs represent more than a negotiating tool for the administration Reports suggest the US wants to use them as a permanent enforcement mechanism in any China trade deal under which Washington could reimpose them if it judged that Beijing was not living up to its end of the bargain and Beijing would not be able to retaliate The lobster industry which has experienced a rare triple whammy of tariff hits is a peek at how this new world might work For all the hoopla by Trump trade supporters and detractors the impact of tariffs on a large and domestically based economy like the United States is more whimper than bang Even as the effect is very sizable for some industries and firms its not very visible as a factor in the overall economy Its not large says Patrick Kennedy coauthor of a March study on the effects of tariffs on the US economy The benefits are small For example the US steel industry has begun to reopen plants and add workers since President Trump announced a heavy 25 percent tariff on imported steel a year ago and extended those tariffs to Canada Mexico and the European Union EU in June But the extra 7000 jobs  a little less than 2 percent of the industrys workforce  hardly represent a renaissance So are the costs by some measures Mr Kennedy and his coauthors of the National Bureau of Economic Research study found that the net impact of the Trump tariffs  the better sales and profits for domestic producers and increased government revenue minus the higher costs for steel users and other consumers  represents a very small drag on the economy 78 billion That is a minuscule 004 percent of the US economy as measured by gross domestic product A February survey of business economists found that if tariffs persist in 2019 more than half the economists believed the drag would be larger lopping a quarter or half a percentage point from GDP growth Whats changed are the winners and losers which are based increasingly on nationality rather than efficiency or business savvy As a steel buyer Mr Knott is clearly on the wrong side of the divide Riverdale produces a wide range of products from birdcages to farm barriers to highsecurity fencing When the president extended his steel tariffs to include Canada as well as Mexico and the EU in June Mr Knott saw steel prices rise across the board His shipping costs soared too since steel mills in Canada are closer to him than ones in Texas or North Carolina Since then prices have moderated but he remains cautious Hes experimented with raising prices in selective markets and through attrition has reduced his workforce from 200 to 150 Since the tariffs hes also seen longtime clients hedge their bets splitting their orders between his company and EU competitors Theres a lot of uncertainty he says So what happens if the threat of tariffs becomes a permanent part of a USChina trade agreement Will that cause ongoing uncertainty among Chinese buyers of US products As it happens the other end of the lobster business has also been hit by two waves of tariffs The US industry has been on a tear in the past decade with both the size and value of the catch nearly doubling since 2008 But in the fall of 2017 Canada and the EU provisionally implemented the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement CETA which immediately eliminated the EUs 8 percent tariff on Canadian live lobster while the tariff remains for US lobster To compensate the Americans who so far have gotten nowhere with the EU worked hard to expand markets in Singapore South Korea and especially China Exports to China more than doubled in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier Then on June 15 the industry learned that in response to Mr Trumps tariffs on China China would retaliate with a 25 percent tariff on various seafood including lobster Ive had one company say that they lost  I mean overnight lost  like 100 percent of their exports to China says Annie Tselikis executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers Association Others lost 80 to 90 percent Its just its been a really really challenging time for these businesses And outside of working to develop new markets theres little the suppliers can do Being caught in the crosshairs of a dispute around intellectual property when youre a food business  it seems nonsensical says Ms Tselikis Ironically the tariffs have not hurt US lobstermen so far Theyre struggling with environmental challenges this year but demand is so strong that they should be able to sell all that they catch no matter who eventually packs processes or ships their product The clear winners of the lobster tariff wars are the Canadian dealers Right now everything is as good as it can be says Leo Muise executive director of the Nova Scotia Seafood Alliance which represents over 80 seafood suppliers in Canadas eastern province If the US and China get rid of the tariffs itll have an impact but I dont expect the effect to be big Mr Knott the lobstertrap maker is a clear loser And so are Chinese consumers Get stories that empower and uplift daily Already a subscriber Log in to hide ads After Chinese countertariffs went into effect last year imports from the the US dried up and the price of Canadian live lobsters almost doubled says Liu Gang a Chinese buyer for the Shanghai Yifeng Food Co who was attending the Seafood Expo North

competitive landscape They can give domestic producers some help But consumers of the countries that impose tariffs often see higher prices whether theyre buying USmade steel or a North American

2019nn It was a day for a civics lesson In a rare 59to41 vote against President Donald Trump a dozen Senate Republicans joined with the minority Democrats to deny the president emergency powers to fund his wall The emergency move violates the Constitution which gives Congress the power of the purse these Republicans said They didnt deny a crisis on the border or even the need to build more wall But they adamantly defended the unique role of Congress to appropriate funds Republican Sen Lamar Alexander of Tennessee quoted the late conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia that the genius of the Constitution is the dispersal of power Sen Jerry Moran the Republican from Kansas posted on Twitter his handwritten reasoning for bucking the president including what everyone learned in highschool government class about the separatebutequal branches Utahs Republican Sen Mike Lee said hes sometimes accused of naivete and is told that the School House Rock song about how a bill becomes a law works in theory but is passe in such a vast and diverse nation But the son of a former solicitor general who argued cases before the Supreme Court on behalf of the Reagan White House vigorously disagrees Over the decades the Congress has ceded more and more power to the presidency said Senator Lee He worked with the White House this week on a legislative fix to the National Emergencies Act of 1976 which Mr Trump insists gives him the power for his wall maneuver Other Republicans in the GOPcontrolled Senate agree with the president The law needs reforming admitted Sen John Kennedy RLa likening it to something my dogs been keeping under the back porch But the law is what the law is not what it ought to be Changing the emergencies law to have Congress approve future emergencies after 30 days  as Lee suggested  was seen as a way to bring wavering Republicans to the presidents side But what president wants to give up power Trump told Lee in a phone call he was not interested A dozen defections is seen as a significant rebuke to the president Both the vice president and president personally pressured Republicans to avoid it while messaging in unison that the vote was about border security  not the Constitution Theyre being beaten up right now Republican Sen Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters earlier this week If you see anybody thats got blood dripping out of their ear they may be changing their mind he laughed even while affirming that he was a firm supporter of the resolution to revoke the presidents emergency declaration One of those bruised Republicans appears to have been Sen Thom Tillis of North Carolina who came out early against the emergency declaration Conservative groups reportedly threatened to primary the senator because of his opposition In the end Senator Tillis turned and voted with the president Get stories that empower and uplift daily Already a subscriber Log in to hide ads While senators appeared to be schooling the president on civics

Monday Loading nFebruary 21 2019n n Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has made criticism of the Republican and Democratic Parties a central theme of his asyet unofficial presidential campaign He and his advisers describe the parties as increasingly extreme migrating to the far right and far left of the political spectrum respectively Are we fated to be in this duopoly in perpetuity Schultz adviser Steve Schmidt recently asked Well maybe notxa0thisxa0duopoly Throughout US history the two parties that compete to run the country have changed combined and split died and been rebornxa0Still given the winnertakeall US electoral system our twoparty system appears likely to endure Weaker political parties along with more extreme partisanship have made for a dangerous combination  one that experts say threatens democratic norms This is the sixth installment of our Democracy Under Strain series But what if the parties real problem is weakness not strength In the modern era electoral reforms have hurt their organizational cohesion outside money has weakened their hold on candidates and elected officials and partisan media has diluted their ability to define their own policies and positionsxa0 At the same time the parties as ideas are as strong as ever Decades of ideological sorting have produced clear leftright bluered teams Like rival teams everywhere the members are ready to fight  no matter what their nominal party leaders want to do The defining characteristic of our age is that the parties are weak but partisanship is strong according to Julia Azari a political scientist at Marquette University Thats a dangerous combination as it risks unmediated political combat that could burst through norms and damage the idea of legitimate opposition And the solution might lie not in attacking the parties from without and supplanting them as Mr Schultz would do but rebuilding and modifying them from within Americas twoparty system is broken Thats what former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says anyway The selfdescribed centrist and possible candidate for president has made criticism of the Republican and Democratic Parties the central theme of his asyet unofficial campaign Both parties today on the far left and the far right are more interested in partisan politics revenge politics said Mr Schultz in a CNN town hall broadcast on Feb 12 I think we could be doing much better On that point many voters might agree Theyre tired of the bickering and gridlock and policy problems left unsolved Americans trust in the parties as institutions is quite low down there with phone companies Congress and the media The percentage of citizens who register as independent rather than Democrat or Republican is at an alltime highxa0 Weaker political parties along with more extreme partisanship have made for a dangerous combination  one that experts say threatens democratic norms This is the sixth installment of our Democracy Under Strain series But what if the parties are the solution as much as the cause for the nations malfunctioning political system After all political scientists and other experts view them as the indispensable organizers of democracy In this view the parties real problem is weakness not strength Electoral reforms have hurt their organizational cohesion outside money has weakened their hold on elected officials and partisan media has diluted their ability to define their own policies and positionsxa0 At the same time the parties as ideas are as strong as ever Decades of ideological sorting have produced clear leftright bluered teams Like rival teams everywhere the members are ready to fight  no matter what their nominal party leaders want to do In US politics the defining characteristic of our age is that the parties are weak but partisanship is strong according to Julia Azari a political scientist at Marquette University in Milwaukee Wis Thats a dangerous combination as it risks unmediated political combat that could burst through norms and damage the idea of legitimate opposition The solution might lie not in attacking the parties from without and supplanting them as Schultz would do but rebuilding and modifying them from within The norms that we depend on to keep democracy functioning arent just there or not They are enforced by political actors and parties play an important role in this enforcement wrote Dr Azari in a 2016 analysis on the blog Mischiefs of Faction Well get back to Schultz and his independent presidential ambitions in a bit First lets consider why the United States has political parties at all They werent part of the original plan Theres no mention of parties in the Constitutions elaborate scheme of branches of government with interlocking and balancing powers Many of the Founding Fathers were suspicious of such political organizations James Madison warned of the mischiefs of faction in Federalist Paper No 10 But when the new Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton decided to push controversial plans such as repayment of state war debts and creation of a national bank he reached out to likeminded business leaders and nationalistminded citizens to form a supportive network Almost inevitably this solidified into a party in favor of a strong centralized government the Federalist Party Its success in the 1790s produced a pushback and figures in favor of a smaller federal role in US life such as Madison and Thomas Jefferson coalesced into the DemocraticRepublican Party These parties began selecting candidates for office running the polls on Election Day and in general organizing the machinery of American democracy The two big parties of today arent literal descendants of these ancestors  there have been organizational zigs implosions and reversals along the way But theyre constructed on the framework established 220odd years ago Twentyfirst century parties have expanded their scope of operation of course They still hold polls and vet and select candidates but they also raise money disperse it emphasize and frame issues try to promote their views to the public and more Defined in their largest sense parties today include interest groups lobbyists factional organizations such as the Freedom Caucus and partisan media Perhaps most importantly they serve as brands Politics is complicated issues are numerous normal life is demanding Who can be an expert in mayoral politics and state issues as well as the whole range of national questions from taxes to foreign policy Party brands are a shortcut  they serve as a general indication of what voters should think about particular candidates or proposed issue solutionsxa0 Americans do not have time to sit there reading an entire candidates platform So the parties perform an important function in serving as this heuristic says Samara Klar an associate professor of political science at the University of Arizona and a scholar of individuals political identities and behavior This is the system Schultz and his advisers want to blow up They describe the Republican and Democratic parties as increasingly extreme migrating to the far right and far left of the political spectrum respectively In such a situation what should a poor centrist do Are we fated to be in this duopoly in perpetuity said Schultz adviser Steve Schmidt Well maybe not this duopoly Throughout US history the two parties that compete to run the country have changed combined and split swapped places and died and been reborn The period prior to the Civil War is notable in this regard The Whig Party went under to be replaced in large part by the new Republican Party The Democratic Party split with slavery as the wedge Some Democrats notably northerners stayed loyal to the Union Some notably southerners became Confederates But the machinery of the US electoral system just isnt set up to encourage multiple party presidential bids For one thing the winnertakeall nature of almost all US elections herds voters into two parties Duvergers Law named for the late French scholar Maurice Duverger posits that electoral systems where individual races are decided in favor of whomever has the most votes inevitably produce twoparty coalitions Thats because citizens are loath to waste votes on candidates with no hope of winning The brutal finality of a majority vote on a single ballot forces parties with similar tendencies to regroup their forces at the risk of being overwhelmingly defeated Duverger wrote Nor is there a pool of persuadable independent voters in which a thirdparty candidate could fish for support True independent is a category in many major political polls and surveys indicate that 30 to 40 percent of Americans now describe themselves as independents But political scientists long ago determined that most of these voters are hidden partisans About onethird of independents vote no differently than committed Republicans and a similar percentage are Democrats in all but name The remaining slice representing about 10 percent of all US voters is truly independent Generally speaking these are the leastengaged citizens in the country with belowaverage interest in political issues and the lowest propensity to vote Dr Klar coauthor of Independent Politics How American Disdain for Parties Leads to Political Inaction says her research shows that voters who decline to identify as Democrat or Republican disproportionately dont want to talk about politics or do anything that betrays their tilt like post a lawn sign Labeling oneself an independent is a social presentation Klar says Its a frame that people like to use For these reasons and more the US remains a largely twoparty country Its been more than 50 years since a thirdparty candidate won a state in a presidential election that was George Wallace who in 1968 won five states and 46 Electoral College votes But thirdparty candidates have swung elections to someone else exPresident Teddy Roosevelt running as the choice of the Bull Moose Party drew votes from GOP President William Howard Taft and helped put Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the White House Some Democrats still blame consumer advocate Ralph Naders run as a Green Party candidate in 2000 for Republican George W Bushs razorthin 2000 election This doesnt mean a Schultz win is impossible Donald Trumps victory in 2016 has taught a generation of pundits never to dismiss possibilities just because they are outside their normal frame of reference Many American voters dont yet have any idea who Schultz is  46 percent of respondents to an early February CNN poll said theyd never heard of the coffee entrepreneur Still Schultzs early numbers are brutal That same CNN poll found only 4 percent of voters said they were very likely to back him And that number was steady across Democrats Republicans and independents alike He appears to have no natural base of support from which to build Schultz would have been better off running as an independent voice within a party says Klar In essence thats what Mr Trump and Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders an independent who caucuses with Democrats did in the 2016 campaign Neither seemed beholden to party orthodoxy At times they seemed to be running against the leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties respectively If you ID yourself as a postpartisan candidate within a party  you can have this image of being an outsider nonestablishment type says Klar But the success of outsiders such as Trump and Senator Sanders inside the system may be a sign of trouble in the modern US party structure It could mean the ability of party leaders to police renegade political behavior is declining One of the fundamental purposes of a political party is to serve as a gatekeeper for potential candidates If it weakens in this regard its ability to shape what the party is for and about lessens too Democratic Party leaders squashed a fastrising Henry Ford for President movement in 1923 for instance Ford was a virulent antiSemite They moved to marginalize segregationist George Wallace within the party forcing him into an independent presidential bid in 1968 The importance of backroom deals and party bosses has been undercut by the rise of binding primaries and postWatergate party reforms however The good news is thats made candidates more reflective of voter choice Thats the bad news too The Founding Fathers worried about the possibility of demagogues and the fickleness of popular choice Binding primaries were certainly more democratic But might they be too democratic write Harvard professors of government Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt in their book How Democracies Die Today the ability of party establishments to act as gatekeepers appears to have ebbed In decades past would Sanders a selfdeclared independent have come as close to winning the Democratic nomination as he did in 2016 Would Trump have been shut out of Republican consideration altogether Many GOP leaders didnt want him to win by the time they recognized the threat he posed to them it was too late Meanwhile the definition of party is broadening in modern America with the rise of partisan interest groups lobbyists and right and leftleaning media organizations The Democratic and Republican Parties today might be seen not as hierarchical quasitribal groups so much as conglomerate blobsxa0 At the same time the party structures have become as polarized as theyve ever been Democrats and Republicans used to be bigtent coalitions with substantial numbers of moderates in both But a big sort begun in the 1960s is now virtually complete Southern Dixiecrat Democrats are today almost all Republicans Rockefeller Republicans are Democrats or powerless members of the GOP This polarization didnt come about by accident It was a deliberate process pushed by activists politicians and experts across the political spectrum says Sam Rosenfeld an assistant professor of political science at Colgate University and author of The Polarizers Postwar Architects of Our Partisan Era In 1950 the American Political Science Association even produced a report Toward a More Responsible TwoParty System which advocated for more ideologically distinct parties as a way to give voters a real choice and produce competing approaches to solving postwar Americas big problems There is a lot to be said for political parties that are organized around actual distinct substantive agendas and that clarify the stakes says Dr Rosenfeld But there were some important flaws in the polarization plan Those who thought it a good idea didnt foresee how often government power would be divided in the future with one party holding the White House and another Congress or at least one congressional branch Supporters thought polarized parties would be more likely to produce unified parliamentarystyle efficient government Instead the US has too often faced gridlock brinkmanship and chaos Nor did they appreciate how powerful party identity would become in a polarized era Republicans and Democrats are increasingly culturally socially and racially distinct The GOP is predominantly white and Christian the Democratic Party is largely a coalition of minorities and some whites with college degrees Thats a recipe for each side to see members of the competing party as the other  people you dont want to talk to or live with a separate tribe A benefit of that old system was a kind of basic level of functionality of governing says Rosenfeld Todays polarized system has a brittleness to it a tendency toward grinding dysfunction and systemic crisis that is a real problemxa0 This is the situation that Marquettes Azari defines as weak parties and strong partisanship Party organizations dont have any real power over officeholders or candidates Meanwhile the rank and file is eager to defend itself against those people on the other side of the ideological divide The result is a decaying sense of legitimate opposition or the realization that the opposing party will win one day in a continuing cycle of exchanged control The chants of Lock her up at Trump rallies in 2016 referring to Hillary Clinton were good examples of this loss of a legitimate opposition norm In 2020 who thinks there wont be Lock him up chants at some Democratic candidates eventsxa0xa0 Colgates Rosenfeld prefers hollow to weak when discussing the state of party organizations Party structures in Congress remain quite effective he points out Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in their own ways have both proven this point At the national level the parties remain skilled at raising money But at the state and local levels theyre far from the vital institutions they used to be Improving US governance in todays polarized world might involve reducing the places in the system where individuals or small groups can exercise veto power and bring normal operations to a halt Rosenfeld says That could mean getting rid of filibusters or the need to vote to raise the debt limit or vote to keep the government open Getting rid of supermajority requirements like the filibuster would not be a solution to polarization but it would allow for a single party when it had power to do more he says Its also true that viewing the state of US political parties in 2019 in the broader context of US history can make the current state of affairs seem less fraught if not exactly stable Schultz for example insists that both parties are moving toward the extremes of their respective ends of the political spectrum Hell offer a centrist choice he says more comfortable to voters But extremism is in the eye of the beholder Polarized politics has come and gone in the US over the years notes Simon Gilhooley an assistant professor of political and American studies at Bard College Trumps antiimmigrant rhetoric his disparagement of minorities and his antiintellectualism are all longstanding elements of US politics says Dr Gilhooley At one point socialism was too Between 1900 and 1915 140 towns in America elected a socialist mayor according to Gilhooleyxa0Oklahoma was a very vibrant area for American socialism he says A more expansive political spectrum has a storied history in the US To some extent todays ideological transformation of party politics with the GOP moving right toward Trumpian populism and Democrats shifting left toward Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders could be seen as a return to the future As the parties have become more sorted and polarized the candidates that appeal to the base in both parties are moving away from the center to try and secure nominations Gillhooley says In that sense the period following the end of World War II might be the real anomaly  a time of relative centrism and overlapping parties driven by the need to stand together against the perceived existential threat of cold war communism Todays robust debates about things as far apart as Medicare for All and The Wall might just be a reflection of the true American political ethos Other parts of the Democracy Under

nFebruary 22 2019n n AntiSemitism has been a chronic problem for Europe but it has come back to the fore in recent weeks France has witnessed an especially shocking wave of antiSemitic incidents this month including the desecration of Jewish graves which were daubed with swastikas And in Britain frustration with unaddressed antiSemitism within the Labour Party led nine members of Parliament to leave the party this week with future defections still speculated Anger at Israel constitutes a major strand in what has become known as the new antiSemitism emanating from Muslim communities in Europe But antiSemitic prejudice is also surfacing more openly in Europe today as populist movements gain momentum on the strength of platforms promoting national identity and hostility to immigrants and other outsiders We have seen a rise in populist movements weve seen a rise in the appetite for conspiracy theories and weve seen a deterioration of liberal democratic norms in several countries says Dave Rich who works for a British group that monitors antiSemitism And when those things happen antiSemitism finds its place Public figures harassed and cemeteries defaced in France MPs in Britain abandoning a party they say is ignoring hatred against Jews Old libels given new life by the far right Why is antiSemitism growing bolder As dusk fell over Paris last Tuesday evening some 20000 people gathered around the iconic statue of La République floodlit in patriotic red white and blue to demonstrate their disgust at antiSemitism I cant stand this racist filth anymore said Florent Nicoud a bearded young filmmaker It makes me throw up France has witnessed an especially shocking wave of antiSemitic incidents this month including the desecration of Jewish graves which were daubed with swastikas Public figures harassed and cemeteries defaced in France MPs in Britain abandoning a party they say is ignoring hatred against Jews Old libels given new life by the far right Why is antiSemitism growing bolder But hate crimes against Jewish targets are on the rise across the continent with increases reported last year in almost every country in Europe As nationalist and populist movements have grown more powerful and Muslim citizens grievances against Israel have reinforced centuriesold European prejudices antiSemitic rhetoric is becoming more open Our country like Europe as a whole and almost all Western democracies is facing a resurgence of antiSemitism not seen since the Second World War French President Emmanuel Macron told the annual dinner of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions CRIF on Wednesday But how Europe should go about combating this trend is by no means clear Despite the age and familiarity of the problem  or perhaps because of it  there are no quick solutions AntiSemitism is a consequence of much deeper divisions and trends in society says Dave Rich head of policy for the Community Security Trust CST a British group that monitors antiSemitism High levels of antiSemitism will continue as long as society and politics are as divided and confrontational as they are now So those deeper problems need to be addressed The new challenge in dealing with antiSemitism is the same as the old one says Sigmount Königsberg the Berlin Jewish communitys antiSemitism commissioner AntiSemitism has to be banned and made unacceptable But antiSemitism is growing increasingly acceptable in certain European quarters People who have these views are feeling more confident to express them says Mr Rich He blames social media and the general deterioration in the tone and nature of public debate But he also holds political leaders responsible for creating a mood more tolerant of antiSemitism Nine members of Parliament quit Britains opposition Labour Party this week citing antiSemitism as one of their main reasons Luciana Berger a Jewish MP who needed a police escort when she attended the last Labour Party annual conference after receiving death threats said the party was institutionally antiSemitic The more people see antiSemitism within the Labour Party and its leadership the more they think its acceptable worries Rich Its normalized because these are not fringe cranks theyre leaders of the Labour Party xa0 Political leaders on the far right routinely denigrate Jews and downplay their suffering Alexander Gauland coleader of the Alternative for Germany AfD party recently described Adolf Hitler and the Nazi era as a speck of bird droppings in over 1000 years of successful German history A senator for the Five Star movement a partner in Italys ruling coalition was put under investigation earlier this month for promoting claims there is a Jewish plot to take over the world citing the notorious forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion In a Swiss trend that the Alpine nation shares with other European countries antiracist activists have noted increasing numbers of hate messages on the internet Inhibitions are slowly disappearing and more and more agitators are acting openly under their real names according to the most recent report by the Swiss Foundation Against Racism and AntiSemitism a nongovernmental group Historically spikes in antiSemitic behavior in Europe have coincided with spikes in violence in the IsraelPalestine conflict says Marc Knobel research director at the CRIF Paroxysms of violence are imported from the Middle East to Europe and Jews are made responsible for actions by the state of Israel he explains Anger at Israel constitutes a major strand in what has become known as the new antiSemitism emanating from Muslim communities in Europe But the prejudices young Muslims express are no different from the ones you hear from the extreme right says JeanYves Camus a specialist in antiSemitism at the French Institute for International and Security Affairs Those prejudices and stereotypes deeply ingrained in French society hold that Jews are disproportionately and unfairly richer than other citizens and more politically influential AntiSemitism has been a constant feature of European history for two millennia Mr Camus points out Today however antiSemitic prejudice is surfacing more openly in Europe as populist movements gain momentum on the strength of platforms promoting national identity and hostility to immigrants and other outsiders We have seen a rise in populist movements weve seen a rise in the appetite for conspiracy theories and weve seen a deterioration of liberal democratic norms in several countries points out the CSTs Rich And when those things happen antiSemitism finds its place AntiSemitism is not only a product of clashing polarizing political divisions it could deepen them warn Jewish leaders Beyond being a threat to Jews antiSemitism is a warning signal of a weakening of democracy in our country suggested Francis Kalifat CRIFs president in a recent statement When you attack Jews you attack the Republic agrees Mr Knobel The Republic is threatened by totalitarians who hate democracy and want to bring it down That leads some to seek solutions in civic education We need to work out a way to encourage young people to see the value of a democratic system says Michael Sauer president of the German Association for Political Education Holocaust education is important but we also need to empower children so they dont think its necessary to discriminate against others Children must be taught to have empathy adds Mr Königsberg Its not just about teaching the Shoah but also showing that Jewish life is something normal in Germany Those are longterm approaches though In his speech Wednesday President Macron called for decisive action promising legislation to ensure that messages on the internet promoting antiSemitism are taken down faster to make it easier to identify those who post such messages anonymously and to make platforms such as Facebook legally liable for the content posted Camus would like to see sterner action by the police and courts If you knew that being an active antiSemite could land you in jail youd think twice before insulting your Jewish neighbor he says In the meantime however demonstrations also help  some I dont know if this changes much but at least we can say Were here you are not alone  said Mr Nicoud the filmmaker as he brandished a placard

violent actions is laid by violent discourse says Rachid Benzine a noted FrenchMoroccan scholar of Islam Words can kill Especially worrying says Fiyaz Mughal an awardwinning monitor of antiMuslim

on Friday was physical security Police stepped up their presence and we are considering any and all security measures says Amelia Neighbors a member of the mosques board Worshipers also appeared to appreciate signs of support from a small group of wellwishers from other faiths who gathered in front of the mosque But they are aware of a hardening mood in the United States Hate crimes have been rising year after year according to FBI figures and attacks on Muslims and their places of prayer hit an alltime high in 2016 before falling back slightly in 2017 the last year for which statistics are available North of the border Canada has stood out for its embrace of multiculturalism and the welcome it has offered to Syrian refugees yet a similar trend has emerged Hate crimes jumped by 47 percent in 2017 from the year before according to government figures and crimes targeting Muslims rose by 151 percent Incidents against Muslims in Quebec peaked in March 2017 the month after a gunman killed six worshipers at the Islamic Cultural Center in Quebec City Ms Elghawaby whose Egyptian parents brought her to Canada when she was a baby says she is not frightened though someone once drove a pickup truck straight at her before swerving away as passengers yelled at her to take her headscarf off But its always in the back of my mind At Torontos Jami mosque the oldest in the city administrator Amjed Syed says he will not be cowed by the Christchurch attack We are not paranoid he says Our doors are open all the time In the heavily Muslim suburb of Pantin north of Paris mosque president Mhammed Henniche is more circumspect Though he turned down a government offer of an armed police guard he is keeping his doors locked between prayers for safetys sake Violent attacks on mosques are rare in France but the atmosphere often feels hostile to Muslims Mr Henniche says We are more visible nowadays less ashamed of our religion than our parents were and that makes a lot of ordinary French people afraid that their country is being taken over he explains In general society there is a fear of Islam adds Mr Benzine Sometimes it looks like mass hysteria he says pointing to the media and political firestorm that erupted recently when a sportswear chain introduced a moisturewicking Islamic headscarf for joggers The retailer was forced to withdraw the item in the face of charges it was contributing to the isolation of Muslim women Prevalent attitudes in France toward Muslims are also manifest in hiring practices A study last year found that a religious Muslim man had four times fewer chances of being called to a job interview than a religious Christian with exactly the same CV Such discrimination frustrates Muslims and makes them turn inward toward their own community says Mr Henniche And that spurs more French racism against them Politicians can make things worse ThenInterior Minister Gérard Collomb said last year he found it shocking that the head of a student union at the Sorbonne University  a Muslim convert  should wear a headscarf He said it was a sign  she is different from French society Nor do Muslims feel very welcome in courtrooms in Bavaria in southern Germany The states constitutional court last week upheld a ban on judges and prosecutors wearing headscarves on the grounds that they should be neutral in matters of religion A Christian cross meanwhile hangs in every Bavarian courtroom German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer a senior member of the ruling Christian Social Union party sparked controversy last year when he declared that Islam is not part of Germany When politicians say all day long that Muslims are different that they dont belong is it surprising when you see an increase in Islamophobic violence wonders Nadim Houry head of the terrorism program at Human Rights Watch It definitely creates an enabling environment The first nine months of 2017 saw 97 attacks on mosques in Germany a 25 percent jump from the same period a year earlier according to the Turkish Islamic Union for Religious Affairs which runs most of the mosques in the country In Britain the number of antiMuslim incidents continues to rise hitting new records in 2017 according to TellMAMA an organization that measures antiMuslim attacks There has been a recent surge in the number of reported incidents and in their level of aggression says Mr Mughal TellMAMAs founder Mr Mughal blames social media companies especially Twitter for being slow to take down posts by rightwing extremists and to block the accounts on which they appear He also points a finger at inflammatory newspaper headlines A 2012 study of the UK press over three months by scholars at Leeds University found that 70 percent of stories about Muslims were hostile and that 80 percent of them included no Muslim sources Press coverage representing Muslims is largely hostile and  Muslim voices remain marginal the researchers found Other factors behind the rise in violent Islamophobia Mr Mughal suggests include Islamist terror attacks the economic downturn and the financial strains it has imposed routine discrimination against Muslims and the far rights effective use of the internet A combination of all these elements has created the perfect storm Mr Mughal says It creates an environment where hate is normalized an environment of dehumanization without any sense of empathy or care in which outrages such as the Christchurch massacre become possible Sadly I think it is only a matter of time before there is another one like that Mr Mughal says What impact is all this having on the overwhelmingly Muslim Middle East where millions of families have relatives living in Europe North America Australia and New Zealand Western foreign policies and the wars they have fostered mean that the United States and Europe are widely unpopular in the Middle East But the Christchurch massacre has brought to the surface uglier allegations The US bans Muslims Muslims are killed in the mosque as easily as they are killed in wars here says Abu Mohammed a young Jordanian engineer They dont just want our economic resources or our lands they truly hate Islam and Muslims The attack has also stirred fears about living in the West It is not safe being an Arab or a Muslim in the West said Awra Ali a Jordanian nurse whose sister lives in Michigan No matter if they talk about human rights or inclusivity you will always be different you will always be the other you will always be a target Some wouldbe emigrants even say they are rethinking their plans to escape the regions deadening unemployment rates I have been dreaming of the West thinking of it as heaven on Earth the answer to all my problems says Mohammed Tamimi an Amman taxi driver who has been applying for scholarships in Australia and Canada But it looks like the Arab world is much better for me At least here I can pray without fear But very few people blame any particular religion for the inflammatory rhetoric and Islamophobic attacks in Western countries that they hear about We cant let one isolated incident by one sick person color our perception of an entire people country or religion insisted Ahmed Awreikat a cousin of one of the men who died in Christchurch at the victims funeral In the West they have democratic institutions transparency and inalienable rights

someones finally speaking for them But the congresswomans core constituents say all this is exactly what they elected her to do To them Ms OcasioCortez shows a keen understanding of what the community needs and doesnt hesitate to use her national status to bring attention to it Her defenders talk about things like opportunity and changing the system They say shes showing that young people women communities of color can take power into their own hands They feel like theyre being heard says Julissa Bisono a Latina activist from the district Shes bringing all of our local issues to a big platform We needed that Mystery novelist Radha Vatsal was playing detective The Queens resident had recently heard about an upstart young woman who was taking on the districts longtime Democratic congressman Joe Crowley Ms Vatsal wanted to learn more about her but couldnt recall her name I was like Ocasio something says Ms Vatsal whos lived in the neighborhood for 17 years I just remember my experience of googling it and trying all different variations and nothing would come up Alexandria OcasioCortezs confrontational style has the young New York congresswoman both leading charges and serving as a lightning rod Back home constituents say someones finally speaking for them That was in April of 2018 Later that month Ms Vatsals mystery woman would secure four times the number of signatures she needed to get on the ballot in New Yorks 14th district In June shed stun political observers by drubbing Mr Crowley in the Democratic primary And in November shed become the youngest woman ever to be elected to Congressxa0xa0 Today a search of Alexandria OcasioCortez turns up countless headlines videos and tweets A recentxa0Gallup survey found that at least 70 percent of Americans now know her name The congresswomans exploding fame has given her a platform to lead the charge on policy ideas around fighting climate change expanding health care and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and made her a darling of the Democratic Partys left wing Its also made her a lightning rod  the target of constant cutting criticism focused on her policies as well as her youth and inexperience Detractors have called her out for opposing Amazons plan to build a second headquarters in New York dismissing her views on economic policy as naive and illinformed She saw blowback last month with the rollout of the Green New Deal  the stimulus package meant to address both climate change and economic injustice thats one of her key policy initiatives  when her office released a fact sheet that didnt match up with the plans legislative text Since being elected shes drawn fire from factcheckers over statements shes made about the Pentagons budget and the Middle East According to Gallup more Americans nationwide now regard her unfavorably than favorably although the rise in her unfavorable rating has come mostly from Republicansxa0 Its a lot to take so early in a political tenure With the 2020 elections on the horizon Ms OcasioCortezs style strikes even some Democrats as too confrontational at a time when party brass are working to unite a diverse coalition If I were her consultant Id tell her Youve got to recognize youre in this game for the long haul You have to do all the heavy lifting and the homework thats required all the relationshipbuilding and coalitionbuilding in order to be seen as a serious legislator  saysxa0Elizabeth Sherman who teaches politics at American University in Washington DC Shes in danger of squandering her credibility But supporters in her district  and she won 78 percent of the vote in the general  say she models exactly the kind of leadership that underrepresented communities desperately need in this nationalized hyperpartisan era Its more than the fact that shes a young woman of color with savvy social media skills in an institution still dominated by older white men Theres real value they say in having a representative who balances national attention with local needs She faces down criticism without blinking and makes a point of voicing her constituents ideals at the highest levels even when those ideals go against the party line And she still shows up to a neighborhood library event on a Saturday afternoon What shes doing is kind of reframing the conversation Ms Vatsal says Shes put an anchor here We may end up in a different position but at least someone has staked our ground Ms OcasioCortez is a Bronx native but a lot of the support she saw in the primary came from Queens  specifically Jackson Heights Bordered on the north by LaGuardia Airport and the south by the 7 train as it rumbles down Roosevelt Avenue the community is a blend of the working class and the welleducated nativeborn millennials and immigrant families Restaurants bear signs in multiple languages Collectively Jackson Heights residents speak more than 160 For years Mr Crowley and the Queens County Democratic Party faced little opposition here The neighborhood like the district is mostly liberal and the former congressman did what good liberals are supposed to do oppose the National Rifle Association NRA support the Affordable Care Act and call for immigration reform By 2016 his 10th consecutive term Mr Crowley was the fourth most powerful Democrat in the House Then Donald Trump won the presidential election Suddenly being a good liberal wasnt enough says Jacob Neiheisel a political scientist at the University at Buffalo You had to be the right flavor of liberal Ms OcasioCortez  or AOC as shes called these days  has that flavor in spades and she worked it during the campaign Through social media she won over young people like David Lee a Queens resident who a year ago was in his second bachelors program at Columbia University Mr Lee was especially taken with a video of her talking about Medicare for All swearing off corporate PAC money and promoting a renewable energy economy Her message instantaneously resonated with me says Mr Lee the son of South Korean immigrants He signed on to Ms OcasioCortezs campaign in April 2018 and soon dropped out of school to volunteer for her full time Others she convinced with her ground game Longtime Jackson Heights resident Nuala ODoherty was at first skeptical that anyone could beat Mr Crowley much less an untried 28yearold But Ms OcasioCortez and her team were unrelenting says Ms ODoherty a mother of five who runs the Jackson Heights Beautification Group The thencandidate went to living rooms and libraries talked to superintendents and students Literally she showed up to events where there were seven people Ms ODoherty says And she wouldnt leave By the time Ms OcasioCortez was elected in November  one of a record number of women who entered Congress and helped flip the House to Democratic control  there was little doubt about her ability to commandeer the spotlightxa0xa0 What critics now are questioning is her leadership Since taking office in January nearly every decision shes made has come under scrutiny both from the right and the left Conservatives love to hate her  for her clothes her dancing even her staff which has faced accusations of obscuring PAC money during the campaign Some have said outright that shes economically illiterate though she majored in economics and international relations at Boston University Last week after the deadly mass shootings at two mosques in New Zealand she drew criticismxa0for tweeting that the NRA uses the phrase thoughts and prayers to deflect attention from proposed policy changes in the aftermath of gun tragediesxa0xa0 Even at home support for Ms OcasioCortez is by no means universal Though she beat Mr Crowley by 15 points estimated turnout in that primary was between 11 and 13 percent suggesting it was a vocal energized minority that won her the nomination Some voice concerns around her approach which they worry could alienate potential allies in Congress Others squirm over the fact that shes a vocal member of the Democratic Socialists of America DSA At an Irish pub in the Queens neighborhood of Woodside attempts to ask about the congresswoman were met with a salty You mean the socialist in the SUV No one cared to comment further Her biggest clash with establishment members of the party came over Amazons plan to build a second headquarters in Long Island City a Queens neighborhood adjacent to her district Ms OcasioCortez was among the most prominent politicians opposing the deal which had been brokered by state party leaders When it fell through the brunt of criticism  that the state had lost 25000 jobs thanks to ignorance and bullheadedness  landed on herxa0xa0 But the congresswomans core constituents say all this is exactly what they elected her to do To them Ms OcasioCortez shows a keen understanding of what the community needs and doesnt hesitate to use her national status to bring attention to it Thats what her opposition to the Amazon deal was they say a plea that leaders deal with the communitys challenges  like overcrowded schools and crumbling infrastructure  rather than looking to a major corporation to supply Manhattanites with jobs and real estate moguls with highend projects We dont care about the big real estate developers says Mr Lee whos also a member of the DSA We care so strongly about the working class communities of color being able to live a decent life in this city Thats what matters to us Political scientists say its too soon to definitively cast Ms OcasioCortezs emergence as part of a broader trend But it is worth looking at the style of leadership shes modeling in an evolving Democratic Partyxa0xa0 At a time when we value institutions less does that outsider perspective carry more weight asks Sally Friedman a professor at the University of Albany who focuses on political representation Its an interesting question about Congress and what kind of Congress were going to have Where do the institutional parts of it fit and whats from the outside For now Ms OcasioCortez seems to have the kind of support at home that can withstand the battery of invectives flung her way Her defenders talk about things like opportunity and changing the system They say shes showing that young people women communities of color can take power into their own hands That a

nMarch 19 2019n n For 14 years Carlos was a doctor and professor in his native Venezuela As the countrys economic humanitarian and political crises spiraled he felt a responsibility to stay Even as shortages intensified and his earnings dwindled he hoped he could keep training new doctors who might one day rebuild the country But when his youngest son was born the crises touched him in new ways I knewxa0 I saw it every day in my workxa0 that I was putting my son at risk by remaining in Venezuela says Carlos who now lives in Switzerland He is one of an estimated 3 million Venezuelans who have left in recent years accelerating a nearly twodecade trend Professional fieldsxa0 from doctors to teachers to lawyers  have been gutted observers say In January when National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó declared President Nicolás Maduros most recent election invalid and called for fresh elections it sparked hope of change But that possibility has also sparked tough discussions about how to rebuild a country thats lost so much human capital This is more than brain drain says Francesca Ramos a professor at Rosario University in neighboring Colombia The past few months have given many Venezuelans  those who stay and those who have left  hope that change is ahead But political transitions are just the first step on a countrys road to more stability Diana Feliú was studying for a masters in business administration when she decided her future in Venezuela was reaching a dead end There werent opportunities at home where inflation has hit more than 1 million percent  making professional salaries if she could find a job nearly worthless So in 2014 she left conducting her thesis abroad presenting her dissertation via Skype and asking her mother to walk in her graduation ceremony receiving Ms Feliús diploma on her behalfxa0 The past few months have given many Venezuelans  those who stay and those who have left  hope that change is ahead But political transitions are just the first step on a countrys road to more stability In a way I feel like Venezuela kicked me out Thats a feeling a lot of my peers share says Ms Feliú who moved to Mexico in 2015 and found a job within three months Shes since married had a child and gained Mexican citizenship Its not that I dreamed all my life to leave Venezuela I had to leave more out of necessity than out of desire Ms Feliú is one of the estimated 3 million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years amid multilayered economic humanitarian and political crises rapidly accelerating a nearly twodecade trend Professional fields  from doctors to teachers to lawyers  have been gutted observers say with some 22000 medical professionals reportedly leaving Venezuela over the past five years alone January brought the first signal of a possible transition of power when National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó declared President Nicolás Maduros most recent election invalid and called for fresh elections making himself acting president He received overwhelming international supportxa0and sparked a glimmer of hope in many Venezuelans But the possibility of change has prompted tough discussions over how to rebuild a country thats lost so many professionals Many question how Venezuela can move ahead with such depleted human capital This is more than brain drain Generations of people effectively trained and contributing or ready to contribute to the country have been forced to leave says Francesca Ramos director of the Observatory on Venezuela at Rosario University in neighboring Colombia Its a huge loss and its very possible that a really really high number wont return homexa0 For decades Venezuela served as a beacon for higher education and highskilled labor in the region Venezuela was one of the first countries in Latin America to have an important number of doctors It had the muscle of the oil state to encourage that kind of training says Dr Ramos She struggles to think of countries with similar experiences that could serve as a road map for Venezuelas rebuilding saying its such a unique scenarioxa0 Carlos who asked not to use his full name because he still has family in Venezuela left with his wife and small child in 2017 after a 14year career in medicine serving as a department head in one of Venezuelas largest public hospitals teaching aspiring doctors at a national university and practicing in a private clinic Shortages were serious before President Hugo Chávez died in 2013 he remembers but the situation got exponentially worse I would see patients and just feel impotent he says by telephone from Switzerland where hes lived for the past 1 12 years I couldnt even make a decision because the hospital had no money patients had no money there were no antibiotics and I became this observer of death instead of a doctor Thats not what I studied for When his youngest son was born in 2014 the weight of what was happening in Venezuela touched him in new ways I couldnt forgive myself for a future where my son had any kind of medical need and I couldnt do anything I knew  I saw it every day in my work  that I was putting my son at risk by remaining in Venezuela Thats not to say leaving was an easy decisionxa0xa0or transition I remember conversations with friends where I said I wouldnt leave the country because we needed to keep training new doctors at the university so that once things improved we could reconstruct the country he recalls For many many years I felt an immense responsibility to stay But by the time he left his 12 to 14hour workdays were barely earning him 100 per month Among professionals who have stayed in Venezuela lifestyles have changed so drastically over the past decade  and particularly in the past five years  that the middle class has been gutted says Armando Gagliardi an economist at the Caracasbased consulting firm Ecoanalítica Their income has been devalued so much that almost 80 percent of what they earn is spent on food That is traditionally the spending pattern of the lower class Mr Gagliardi says But as professionals fleexa0their emigration has consequences for Venezuela todayxa0 and likely tomorrowxa0 Anytime someone wants to visit a dentist or a doctor the first question is Are they still here  says David Smilde a sociology professor at Tulane University who splits his time between New Orleans and Caracas Usually you find that they arent You cant count on your normal networkxa0 The fact that Venezuela is left without these professionals compromises the functioning of the country Without them there is no health or education says Mr Gagliardi There are also fewer consumers creating a damaging trickledown effect for commerce or street vendors And finding and retaining employees is increasingly difficult as people continue to leave Their return is key for development Dr Smilde says There need to be programs to motivate people to come back President Maduros Return Home initiative has sponsored repatriation for families unable to afford tickets home The opposition is discussing the need for incentives for citizens to return as well Even if Venezuela turns a new political or economic corner though many Venezuelan expatriates say the work that goes into setting up new careers and lives abroad means they wouldnt run home Carlos the doctor says his family is privileged  his wife is Swiss which allowed them to move abroad and work But he cant practice medicine again until he learns Swiss German and sits for required exams which he expects to take at least another yearxa0 Were asked all the time if well go back The idea obviously never leaves my mind or my heart he says but doesnt foresee it anytime soon Aside from a new political direction Venezuela will have to rebuild its institutions he says The social deterioration wont be resolved with a change in government Alejandro Armas a lawyer who specialized in public administrative law and left Venezuela in 2015 says maybe in the future he and his wife now living in Buenos Aires Argentina could return home If someone calls me to say Look we need you in Venezuela to reestablish our administrative or tribunal law I would go running But my wife wouldnt follow at least not anytime soon Vacation seems like the most likely reason to return in the short to medium term say several Venezuelans who fled But Dr Smilde says that if Venezuela sees some kind of transition soon hed expect more than 50 percent of the exodus to return  especially older professionals families and people who cant find work abroad in what they were trained for he says mentioning an architect friend in Miami who now does odd jobs in home repair Those are the people that would come back as soon as they could The longer the crises drag on the less likely rapid returns will be But it may not be the end for Venezuela if citizens dont immediately return home Dr Ramos says Get stories that empower and

sentiment is percolating in rural Nebraska where residents are still bailing out from last months epic flood the most widespread in memory As such extreme weather events pile up some say they are beginning to change hearts and minds here  not politically but practically Part of the change in thought is coming from farmers themselves especially those involved with the small but growing regenerative farming movement The severe flooding that inundated Nebraska last month washed away fields bridges and roads But the extreme weather is also starting to sway residents thinking about climate Just dont call it climate change The term climate change has become so politicized that its not readily accepted in rural America even with the extreme weather But a subtle shift does seem to be taking hold When Yale University social scientists assessed public opinion about climate change last year they found that 64 of Nebraskans believed climate change was happening That was up 6 points from their 2014 survey but still 6 points behind the national average Many people remain skeptical of climate projections but as local pastor Richard Randolph says people are beginning to change The flood carried away edges of his fields dumped up to 6 inches of useless sand on his fertile loam and deposited incongruously the elastic band of a pair of Hanes underwear on a bush But everywhere Chad Christianson looks all he sees is green The green rye he planted last fall stands in sharp contrast to the brown soil and cornstalks More importantly it held the soil in place in all but the most flooded areas of his fields lessening the waters impact Its a first step in Mr Christiansons push to become more weatherresilient I dont know about climate change Mr Christianson says But I think the weather is going to be more extreme going forward The severe flooding that inundated Nebraska last month washed away fields bridges and roads But the extreme weather is also starting to sway residents thinking about climate Its a sentiment that is percolating here in rural Nebraska With the state still in recovery mode many Nebraskans say its early for them to start contemplating the longterm implications of last months epic flood the most widespread in memory But as such extreme weather events pile up some say they are beginning to change hearts and minds here  not politically but practically This flood didnt come out of nowhere but it went beyond almost anyones expectations says Tyler Williams an educator with the extension service at the University of NebraskaLincoln which works with farmers So I definitely think people in the agricultural world are thinking All right Ive got to fix something do something different Part of the change in thought is coming from farmers themselves especially those involved with the small but growing regenerative farming movement Conversations were already happening before the flood says Graham Christensen a fifthgeneration farmer and president of GC Resolve a grassroots communitydevelopment business But after the flood a lot more folks are like Yeah I have never seen that my dad has never seen that my grandpa has never seen that This is a pattern thats emerging The movement which focuses on the health of soil emphasizes techniques like planting cover crops as a way to keep more roots in the soil beyond the corn and soybean plants that many farmers raise in rotation These roots keep more nutrients in the soil make it easier for water to drain which improves flood resilience and keep more water storedxa0in the soil which improves droughtresistance Thats key for farmers like Mr Christianson here in Fremont Just dont call it climate change We are not necessarily going around and saying Hey climate change climate change climate change says Mr Christensen of GC Resolve who travels the state preaching regenerative agriculture Were more focused on rallying around the solution which is better soilhealth principles The term climate change has become so politicized that its not readily accepted in rural America even with the extreme weatherxa0Most pastors in the state are afraid of addressing the issue for fear of splitting their congregations according to a 2015 University of NebraskaLincoln report A couple comes out of a Lynch Nebraska donation center with six gallon jugs of emergency water because the floods have intermittently made their water unsafe Does the extreme weather imply climate change No she answers No he answers then gives a short lecture on avoiding preconceived ideas Skeptics have a point Last months flooding was the result of such a fluky combination of snow rain frozen ground and rapid melt that even warming advocates admit that it alone may not be a harbinger of change to come But previous events  flooding of the Missouri River in 2011 an increasing number of intense rain events and one of the 10 coldest Februaries on record  have residents reassessing the future Its getting to the point where its hard to ignore says Kim Morrow a behavior change expert at Verdis Group a sustainability and climate resiliency advisory group based in Omaha When Yale University social scientists assessed public opinion about climate change last year they found that 64 of Nebraskans believed climate change was happening That was up 6 points from their 2014 survey  a rise consistent with the slow change in a swath of red states from Idaho to Kentucky  but still 6 points behind the national average The Yale research also reveals an urbanrural split In Lancaster County home of Lincoln and the university 72 of people said change was happening In rural counties farther west barely half doxa0xa0 Yes I think its still political and divided but people are beginning to change says the Revxa0Richard Randolph senior pastor at Christ United Methodist Church in Lincoln He has submitted to this years NebraskaKansas annual conference of the United Methodist Church a petition calling on churches to become better informed about global warming and to set goals for reducing their carbon footprints For the most part I pastor a church thats moderate to progressive theologically And so I

the Rev Andy Alexander director of the Collaborative Ministry Office at Creighton a Catholic university in Omaha is not seeing much of a shift at all People are skeptical about that kind of thinking which they call projection he says Even if they acknowledge they need to be more prepared for chancier weather in the future theyre not making a link between their present practices and warming I dont hear people saying our use of fossil fuels is leading to this problem he says And theyre not making the broader connections Pope Francis has made between warmings impact on the poor and the

nApril 16 2019n n Its undeniable that lightweight packaging makes grocery shopping easier But all that plastic paperboard and foil comes at a steep cost to the environment Is there a better way

tied to the change from crackers in a barrel at the store to prepackaged crackers that could sit on the shelf and stay fresh and crispy for a lot longer says Susan Selke director of the School of Packaging at Michigan State University in East Lansing Could we conceivably go back to that cracker barrelstyle economy Maybe But it would involve drastic societal changes This story was produced in conjunction with Earth Beats a Sparknews collaboration highlighting environmental solutions for Earth Day Brooklyn resident Katerina Bogatireva had long carried reusable bags to the grocery store and rejected singleuse plastic water bottles But when her son Sepand was in kindergarten she stepped up her game After having a sustainability lesson in school she says He was very concerned And he said Mummy do you know how long plastic will remain in the landfill And that sort of broke my heart For Ms Bogatireva that moment spurred a lifestyle change that led to a business venture Now four years later she owns a grocery store called Precycle where shoppers can buy their fruits and vegetables pastas and grains flours and legumes and oils and vinegars without the packaging that typically comes with them nnnnnnnnnnn The advent of modern food packaging has given us portability freshness and a lot of waste Could a return to a simpler kind of grocery store help us live more lightly on the planet  Precycle isnt the only packagingfree business cropping up in recent years Theres also Zero market in Colorado Fillgoodco in California and Package Free Shop also in Brooklyn And large corporations are starting to take notice too Companies like Starbucks Nestlé HäagenDazs Procter  Gamble and others are taking steps to reduce their packaging waste Starbucks has made plans to ditch plastic straws Nestlé pledged to make its packaging entirely recyclable or reusable and British grocer Iceland has promised to eliminate plastic packaging from its own brand products This comes as part of a broader cultural shift in the popular environmental movement from touting recycling to emphasizing efforts to reuse and reduce consumption of singleuse items like bags cutlery and containers And if this approach continues to catch on that could say something about what people value Plastic is everywhere in our economy says Thomas Kinnaman an environmental economist at Bucknell University in Lewisburg Pennsylvania So if companies like Precycle take off he says it will signal that people really do want to find another way despite the benefits plastic packaging can provide One benefit of plastic packaging has been convenience If grocery goods are already portioned out into lightweight packaging and plastic bags are on hand the only things shoppers need to bring to the store are themselves and their wallets Furthermore such packaging has allowed for the development of convenience items like premade meals and individual snack bags for childrens lunches Opting to avoid packaging entirely can be particularly inconvenient says Ms Bogatireva When she decided to reduce her own contributions to landfills she found that she had to cobble together her shopping trips stopping at multiple stores and farmers markets to find the items she needed without the plastic Precycle grew out of that hassle officially opening its doors in December 2018 to make it easier for consumers to choose packagingfree options Heres how it works Customers bring their own containers to Precycle or buy reusable vessels sold there When they enter the store they have to weigh their empty containers which they then weigh again at checkout to know how much to pay for Despite the inconvenience of carrying containers to the store people are buying into it says Ms Bogatireva Precycle has a loyalty program and already about 1200 people have signed up Another benefit of packaging that has become integral to modern society is its ability to make something perishable last much longer says Susan Selke director of the School of Packaging at Michigan State University in East Lansing The advent of modern packaging is often tied to the change from crackers in a barrel at the store to prepackaged crackers that could sit on the shelf and stay fresh and crispy for a lot longer she says Could we conceivably go back to that cracker barrelstyle economy Maybe But it would involve drastic societal changes That is a limitation for Precycle says Ms Bogatireva As a result the store primarily carries ingredients rather than readymade foods But even then there are challenges Ms Bogatireva has no plans to stock meat or fish but customers want cheese so she has opted for waxwrapped cheeses and encourages customers to make candles from the wax Not everyone is inclined to make these lifestyle choices says Dr Kinnaman But those who do are often doing a sort of informal costbenefit analysis  weighing factors like the convenience and nonperishability against the guilt they may feel for filling up their trash cans and their understanding of the danger to the environment posed by that waste Some things are beyond individual consumers actions though My biggest challenge is to reduce waste as a business says Ms Bogatireva Its tricky to find suppliers that use no singleuse packaging whatsoever For Precycle she opts for suppliers who use recyclable packaging like cardboard

Monday Loading nApril 16 2019n n The fire that ravaged Notre Dame in Paris on Monday night has shocked France The flames came close to destroying the cathedral and they gave the country pause for thought at a time when it has been torn by angry social protests President Emmanuel Macron appealed to citizens sense of their common history as he pledged to rebuild the damaged church Paris is not the only city to have suffered in this fashion Others have suddenly lost cultural icons in a variety of ways  New York saw terrorists bring down the Twin Towers and kill thousands in 2001 Adolf Hitler blew up Warsaws royal palace and a conflagration destroyed Brazils National Museum last year How well these cities and communities have coped with their losses and tried to overcome them seems to depend heavily on how deeply they can draw on what holds them together and turn their backs on what sets them apart Paris appears to be on the right track This has prompted a coming together a sense of solidarity said one Parisian as he snapped a photo of Notre Dame The Notre Dame fire represents a major cultural loss for Paris But communities around the world from Warsaw to New York offer evidence that recovery is possible As dawn broke over Notre Dame on Tuesday small fires still smoldered Its ancient timberframed roof and spire had gone up in smoke But the cathedral stood firm an imposing massive presence that Mondays blaze disfigured but did not destroy Parisians were in shock The spectacular flames had come close to destroying one of their citys most precious icons and it will take years to restore the building But the nearcatastrophe has reminded a city shaken in recent months by violent social protests of what its citizens have in common their history Ive noticed that this has prompted a coming together a sense of solidarity says Alain Meunier who had stopped on his way to work to take a smartphone picture of Notre Dame There is a strong collective emotion The Notre Dame fire represents a major cultural loss for Paris But communities around the world from Warsaw to New York offer evidence that recovery is possible Other cities around the world from Rio de Janeiro to New York to Warsaw have lost symbolic cultural buildings over the years How successful they have been in overcoming those losses seems to depend largely on how deeply they have been able to draw on what their residents have in common French President Emmanuel Macron appealed to that sort of shared heritage on Monday evening speaking in front of Notre Dame as it burned We were able to build this cathedral and to enlarge and improve it over the centuries he said And we will rebuild this cathedral all together it is certainly part of French destiny Mr Macrons announcement of an international donation drive to fund the cathedrals restoration met with quick success Three of Frances richest people Bernard Arnault who owns LVMH rival luxury goods magnate François Pinault and LOreal owner Françoise Bettencourt Meyers have pledged 500 million euros between them and the Paris city government promised 100 million more The authorities in Warsaw relied on similar patronage in the 1970s when they set about rebuilding the ancient Royal Castle which had been a symbol of Polands independence and sovereignty and a powerful element of Poles national identity according to the castles curator Bozena Radzio That she says explains why Adolf Hitler ordered that the fortress should be blown up during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944 along with the citys Old Town that had already been badly damaged in fighting After World War II Polands new Communist rulers also found the castle too symbolic to want to restore it its associations with royalty and with a parliament that had drawn up Europes first liberal Constitution in 1791 were too strong They did however rebuild the old city in the 1950s in approximate fashion They based their plans partly on paintings by the 18thcentury Italian artist Canaletto the Younger that had been saved from the castle before its destruction But the reconstruction of a part of the city that had been almost completely obliterated during the war was very popular among Poles who saw it as new evidence of their survival skills Only in the 1970s when the government sought ways of appeasing popular unrest did the authorities begin to reconstruct the castle in a project 90 funded by private donations from around the world Again the architects used a fairly free hand Neither the castle  nor the Old Town were rebuilt exactly as they looked before the war says Jaroslaw Trybus former deputy director of the Museum of Warsaw The castle before the war seemed quite low and it had bad proportions It is bigger today and workers used better construction materials Authentic or not the building has grown so strongly into the cityscape that it is difficult to imagine the place without it says Ms Radzio Many young people do not even know that it was destroyed during the war That is scarcely the case in lower Manhattan in New York where the iconic World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept 11xa0n2001 killing thousands after Al Qaeda terrorists crashed passenger planes into them But New Yorkers discovered  if only briefly  an unusual unity in the wake of that disaster setting aside their normal differences We all worked together we refocused It felt like we came together as city dwellers thinking of ourselves as being on the same team on the same side says Edy Nathan a therapist in New York who was just beginning to work with trauma victims at the time We were one and it actually felt sadly amazing she adds What could we be if we all worked together regardless of our differences But such emotional experiences soon evaporated under the pressure of colossal turf fights and clashing opinions about how the Twin Towers site should be rebuilt The governor of New York at the time George Pataki set up a panel to adjudicate between the competing interests jockeying for influence in one of the densest cultural and economic centers in the United States  and to distribute nearly 10 billion in federal funds These experts ran a global competition for architects and urban planners to submit innovative ideas for both new buildings and new urban spaces on the site These plans thrilled Tom Stoelker who remembers the visceral reactions he felt when he was in lower Manhattan that September day witnessing the burning towers and their collapse I immediately thought Will they rebuild it he says and was so inspired by the prospect of excitingly new buildings that he went back to school and later became a journalist covering architecture around the world Yesterday I thought the same about rebuilding Notre Dame and what could be saved Mr Stoelker says In the end the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the private billionaire developer Larry Silverstein overruled an innovative plan to rebuild the site and chose a more traditional and often very controversial approach Paris might have an easier time of it  because theyre going to be looking at a restoration says Mr Stoelker At Notre Dame theyre going to be working with something that exists and in an area steeped in history The National Museum of Brazil was steeped in history too It was Latin Americas largest museum and its biggest repository of archives But it has not existed since a massive fire destroyed it and most of its contents last September The museum was housed in a former royal palace amidst an extraordinary park but it was a largely forgotten and poorly maintained institution It could hardly be further from the high finance and high politics of Manhattan or less like the global cultural icon that is Notre Dame Few Brazilians save a small group of academic anthropologists and natural science researchers who made the museum their home appreciated the value of its collection and archives Sitting in a working class district of Rio it attracted few wealthy visitors though it was often the first museum that children from poorer areas visited Underfunded and underappreciated the National Museum went up in flames shortly before fiercely fought and deeply divisive presidential elections that Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil had no time to digest its loss before the country was consumed by angry political battles that deepened social divisions and left little space for a common approach to the museums possible rebirth We have thousands of problems says Antonio Carlos de Souza Lima a professor of ethnology at the museum The fire was another tragedy of the numerous tragedies that we are suffering through now and I dont believe that Cariocas Rio residents have got over it So few people knew about the National Museum laments Thaddeus Gregory Blanchette who earned his PhD there We still dont know if we will be able to rebuild everything and the world has moved on Dr Blanchette can only dream of the sort of pledge President Macron made to France on Monday evening that we will rebuild Notre Dame because the French expect it because our history deserves it and because it is our profound destiny Get stories that empower and uplift daily Already a subscriber Log in to hide ads In 40 years from now the average person will be able to go into Notre Dame and not be able to tell

right now the mood in Canada is not nearly as angry or explosive Many see acceptance rooted in the way the country was founded After the British prevailed over New France in the Seven Years War British officials signed the Quebec Act of 1774 It guaranteed Frenchspeakers the right to maintain their religion and civil laws laying the groundwork for whats often called Canadas culture of accommodation While rightwing and antiglobalist populism plagues the West it remains rarer in Canada Canadian politics have taken a different path thanks to geography to wars past and to political decisions made centuries ago Multiculturalism has also been encouraged by geography A cold mass of land bordered by two oceans and the most powerful country in the world across its entire southern flank Canada has had to invite people to live here Those it does invite are the best and brightest  one reason diversity multiculturalism and views toward immigrants rank so high in opinion surveys Canada is way more of an idea than it is an ethnic identity or even a collection of myths says author Stephen Marche Multiculturalism really does have that power as a binding agent Accusations of fraud and corporate favors secret tapes and political rivals expunged For two months the nation has been gripped by a scandal at the highest tiers of government This week after two prominent members were expelled from the ruling political party one newspaper dubbed it the Tuesday night massacre a reference harking back to the Watergate scandal No this is not the United States nor does it have anything to do with the Mueller investigation This is Canada under the leadership of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau whose sunny ways have been symbolizing all that is right about Canada  and all that seems to be going so very wrong in the rest of the world Now Mr Trudeaus office faces allegations that it pressured former Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody WilsonRaybould to drop bribery and fraud charges against a Quebec engineering firm over its dealings in Libya The scandal which broke in February has always been about far more than the charges at hand While rightwing and antiglobalist populism plagues the West it remains rarer in Canada Canadian politics have taken a different path thanks to geography to wars past and to political decisions made centuries ago It started after a newspaper alleged that Ms WilsonRaybould the first indigenous woman to hold that office was reassigned for refusing to bend to the will of those at the top who wanted to shield the company SNCLavalin from prosecution It has since turned into a hesaid shesaid And the optics couldnt be worse for Mr Trudeau a selfdefined feminist leader and his narrative of a new way of governance It looks like white male power punishing the new player for not doing politics as usual Sunny ways have definitely clouded over In a recent poll by Ipsos Mr Trudeaus approval rating fell to 40 lower than President Donald Trumps 43 approval rating Yet for Canadians this is more than a story of the political fate of Mr Trudeau or his Liberal party It sits at the heart of how Canadians view themselves and how the world views Canada  long touted as an exception in the era of the rightwing populist An opinion piece this week in The Globe and Mail which broke the original story worried whether Mr Trudeau has channeled Trump It hints at the question many Canadians are asking themselves Have we become what they are History suggests the answer is no Canadian politics have taken a different path than in the United States and many Western democracies where antiimmigrant and antiglobalization sentiment has grown  and its not just because of Mr Trudeau Theres a much longer history that owes to geography to wars past and to political decisions made centuries ago Thats not to say there is no anxiety This is an election year and many political observers are worried about the populism creeping into public discourse in this normally restrained nation Yet even the humblest Canadian will admit that the cleavages dont run nearly as deep as they do elsewhere  the mood not nearly as angry or explosive Mike Gray sits in his Singer sewing shop in early January in downtown Oshawa which was rocked by economic news in late November when General Motors announced a fiveplant closure across North America including its last assembly line here He says he believes Canada wont be torn apart and politics wont turn meanspirited as it has south of the border I think its just the way we were brought up he says People are probably a little more gentle  I think that were used to not rattling people up its just not our nature Its become almost a parlor game Canadians and Americans comparing the differences in national character Americans are the brash and boastful at least according to the view up here while Canadians are the polite and pleasant The election of Mr Trump in 2016 after a boisterous campaign compared with the election of Mr Trudeau in 2015 after a more muted national plebiscite did nothing to dispel these views But the differences in character caricatured or not show up in other measures as well One recent Canadian study compared 40 million tweets among Canadians and Americans The idea was to explore what language choices reveal about stereotypes of national temperament The researchers found that Canadians tend to use words that are positive such as great amazing awesome thanks and beautiful while Americans tweets skew more negative with words such as hate tired or bored What may be coming out here if this is a reflection of Canadian culture and our choices may be that Canadians are more invested in a sort of friendly and accepting identity says Bryor Snefjella one of the studys researchers from McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario The differences in national persona in some ways extend all the way back to the Revolutionary War The rebellious members of the 13 Colonies fought to carve out their own identity and country while those who wished to stay the subject of the British crown fled north Loyalists essentially antirevolutionaries shaped the foundation of Englishspeaking Canada with the values of peace order and good government dominating the early political culture while those in a fledgling America infused their guiding charter with words such as unalienable Rights and Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness To this day Americans seem more comfortable engaging in a fiery populism Stephen Marche a Canadian author wrote an essay called Canadian Exceptionalism In it he argues that one of the key differences behind the divergent paths of Canada compared with the US under Mr Trump lies in the conservative parties of each nation Although Canadian Conservatives have taken up wedge issues especially around immigration in their quest to regain power he says it is nothing like what he hears from some farright elements of the US Republican Party in which there really is a sense of wrecking the whole thing he contends Anger over diversifying populations and influxes of people from other countries is fueling populist movements around the world In Europe its helped push Britain into unknown territory as it stumbles out of the European Union From Hungary to Turkey to the Philippines authoritarian leaders have risen to office greatly expanding their powers in part over concern about controlling borders and a backlash to the others in society Those voices exist in Canada too  and in an election year are reverberating more loudly than ever  but the country has a longer history in tolerancebuilding forming a multicultural ethos that views immigration as a pragmatic response to an aging population and declining fertility When the Canadian government announced plans to attract 1 million newcomers in the next three years this winter it was to very little opposition New figures show Canada surpassing the US in the number of refugees it resettled in 2018 for the first time in 72 years One of those newcomers arrived on a rainy night in December The usual crowd has congregated outside customs at Toronto Pearson International Airport They are there to greet passengers of Turkish Airlines Flight 17 from Istanbul Among those waiting are Lana Delmaestro her husband and their young son The youth holds a homemade poster with a maple leaf drawn in red marker and the name Alaa They intently watch the sliding doors for a Syrian refugee theyve never met but whom the family sponsored with a group of other Canadians By now these airport scenes  of Canadians holding their flags and welcome signs as they meet refugees theyve helped bring to Canada through the countrys private sponsorship model  are commonplace In fact the Delmaestros are one of three groups of people waiting for Syrian refugees on this flight alone Ms Delmaestro hugs Alaa when she walks through the main arrival area dressed in a black sweatshirt and maroon headscarf after a long journey from Jordan She hands the young Syrian an Ikea bag with a winter coat and boots Then Ms Delmaestro turns to her son still holding his sign and repeats something shes told him over and over since they decided to sponsor a refugee family legally committing to a year of supporting her financially and emotionally This is the most important thing our family will ever do Many see this acceptance rooted in the way the country was founded After the British prevailed over New France in the Seven Years War British officials signed the Quebec Act of 1774 It guaranteed Frenchspeakers the right to maintain their religion and civil laws laying the groundwork for whats often called Canadas culture of accommodation Peter Russell author of the 2017 book Canadas Odyssey argues that the incomplete conquest of Frenchspeaking Canada as well as its indigenous peoples created a series of nations within the country that formed the foundation of a high level of tolerance for diversity today Bicultural tensions between English and French the endemic fault line of Canadian politics adds author Erna Paris has required compromise at every facet of Canadas political life As Quebecois identity strengthened in the 1960s thenPrime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau Justin Trudeaus father set to quell tensions with an official policy on multiculturalism in 1971 It codified in essence that no one religion or ethnicity was more important than another Accommodation and compromise have been the modus vivendi of nationbuilding in this country says Ms Paris Multiculturalism has also been encouraged by geography A cold mass of land bordered by two oceans and the most powerful country in the world across its entire southern flank Canada has had to invite people to live here Unlike the uncontrolled immigration from Mexico and Central America to the US or from Northern Africa to Europe  which fuels perceptions of chaos and crisis  Canada relies on a highlycontrolled points system based on language ability age and skills Its immigrants are the best and brightest  the most educated immigrants among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries  which is one reason diversity multiculturalism and views toward immigrants rank so high in opinion surveys Increasingly I feel Canada has its own momentum and its just going off on its own route Its not just notLondon notNew York which is what it always was says Mr Marche Canada is way more of an idea than it is an ethnic identity or even a collection of myths Multiculturalism really does have that power as a binding agent Mr Russell argued in his book that modern Canada might be more like a civilization than a nationstate As an example of how diverse peoples can live together in freedom and peace he writes this loose never settled alliance of peoples called Canada could replace empire and nationstate as the most attractive model in the twentyfirst century That does not mean populism doesnt exist here In fact the Reform Party a rightwing populist movement founded in the late 1980s predates Americas tea party movement Today Canadians will immediately point to Doug Ford the premier of Ontario who won on a decidedly populist platform last spring Or to Quebec where Premier François Legault ran as an outsider in the fall He promised language tests for new immigrants and has proposed secular restrictions on religious symbols for some publicsector employees both interpreted largely as antiMuslim policies To the extent that Canada gets illegal immigration most of it flows through the border Quebec shares with the US giving space to new populist faces Farright groups are here too Hate crimes have also increased in recent years according to federal statistics Before the New Zealand mosque shootings Canada suffered its own shooting at a Quebec City mosque that killed six in 2017 And the shame of the federal governments policies toward Canadas indigenous peoples and what many see as a halfhearted attempt at reconciliation hangs heavy  made worse by the ouster of Ms WilsonRaybould from the Liberal Party Trump admirers exist here as well Ken Montgomery a truck driver in Oshawa is one He says he hates Mr Trudeau because Mr Trudeau hates Canada He wishes a Trumplike figure would emerge on the national scene We need it he says This doesnt surprise Frank Graves the president of Ekos Research who says that its denial to think that Canada is immune from the nativist forces kicking up elsewhere He measures attitudes between open versus ordered  ordered implying those with pessimistic economic outlooks or antielite sentiment or the kind of worldview that fueled a political backlash in the US  and counts 30 of the population holding such attitudes He says the SNCLavalin affair could intensify resentments leaving Canadians with the impression that the justice system is twotiered Still farright populism in Canada is different than in the US Mr Graves calls it a northern populism Its key distinction  apart from not being as welldeveloped nor as widely embraced as it is in the US or Europe  is that it is not racially charged Unlike the United States where populism is bounded by race and typically the attraction to it is restricted largely to white Americans in Canada we dont see that particular boundary The boundaries are more rooted in social class he says Mr Ford for example does not invoke race or ethnicity in his campaigns and in fact drew heavy support from nonwhite neighborhoods that ring Toronto Mr Graves sees reasons for concern though Even though Canada has been held up as a success story on immigration  and polls show Canadians becoming more accepting of foreigners  a vocal minority who oppose the influx of outsiders is growing louder And politicians are listening Maybe so but Dan Carter isnt one of them Lean and silverhaired he is the new mayor of Oshawa sworn in just days after GM announced its plant closure what he says is the No 1 issue at city hall The assembly plant has been in Ottawa since 1953  a sprawling icon of Canadian manufacturing The American carmaker itself has been operating in this town east of Toronto for more than 100 years In the 1980s some 23000 people had company jobs Now there are only 2600 unionized jobs left at the plant And all of those will be gone by the end of this year Resistance to the shutdown exists with protests and social media campaigns like SaveOshawaGM But the anger is not an outright backlash against mainstream politicians or even globalization  the kind that flipped many Rust Belt states to Mr Trump in 2016 Instead it remains narrowly focused on the US company itself Greedy Motors read one sign at a protest in January In fact anger might not even be the right word Donna Lindsay is waiting in the parking lot for her daughter to get off work Ms Lindsay worked at the plant for 35 years until she retired in an earlier round of downsizing Yet when asked who she is upset with its not immigrants or refugees who could be competing with Canadians for jobs Its not politicians either local or federal Its not their fault Its GMs fault she says Then she qualifies her feelings even more Im not angry Im sad and hurt Steven High a history professor at Concordia University in Montreal has interviewed workers in former industrial regions on both sides of the border and notes some key differences in the way workers react to economic disruptions The first centers around blame When closures happened in previous decades Canadian unions would rail against the US A lot of the Canadian unions would wrap themselves in the Canadian flag with a discourse around American bosses and Canadian workers he says After decades of free trade and globalization that kind of rhetoric doesnt bring a response from the government the way it once did though the culprit  in this case a US company  remains the same Canadian workers are also better protected which helps quiet some of the vitriol over layoffs Rates of unionization which were similar in both countries in the 1960s are about three times as high in Canada today as in the US giving members a progressive workingclass voice to represent them Canadians have a stronger safety net too  with universal health care and more affordable education  which further softens the blow of losing a job Still disillusionment among the working class may be rising Deindustrialization has happened later in Canada and Mr High theorizes that means discontent could just be lagging We havent seen this rupture and the polarization like across both Eastern and Western Europe and the United States he says But I think were seeing that rupture starting to emerge The closure of the plant in Oshawa does mark a milestone but it doesnt have to become an antiglobalization narrative says the mayor It doesnt get us anywhere to say theyre making it somewhere else in the world Thats why were able to buy TVs for 400 he says at city hall in early January While GM still maintains a footprint here with its corporate headquarters for Canada and a research center for alternativefuel cars and other technologies the assembly plant was long vulnerable to closure says David Paterson vice president of corporate affairs at GM Canada He says it was running at 30 below capacity The company says it will retrain workers who seek new employment and has already been approached by firms looking to hire The company is also partnering with community colleges to identify future jobs and the training required to fill them Mayor Carter says a diversified economy and strong employment can help buffer the blow But residents also need a vision for their future In some ways thats an easier sell than it might be in the US he says We in Canada look at things a little bit differently We believe that we are our brothers keeper he says Get stories that empower and uplift daily Already a subscriber Log in to hide ads Yes the GM closure is bad he acknowledges And I understand the anger and I understand the frustration But we need to set the environment where people understand that were going to get through this storm  that whatever we face well still be able to succeed he says This moment is calling for

Supreme Court will hear the case on April 23 As tensions simmer about the border the US commerce secretary wants to get a better handle on the number of noncitizen immigrants in the country with the

was also unconstitutional A federal judge in Maryland found the same in early April The Supreme Court had been set to hear a case on the citizenship question in February  regarding whether Mr Ross could be deposed  but it was removed from the calendar after the ruling in New York A month later however the case was put back on the docket Now the justices will be deciding whether the lower court

halted Theres nothing unusual about a new Cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction he added But the trial did go ahead with a supplemental memorandum in which Mr Ross acknowledged that soon after his appointment as Secretary of Commerce he had begun considering whether to reinstate a citizenship question This among other actions amounted to a veritable smorgasbord of classic clearcut APA violations the federal judge in New York ruled The court has typically been forgiving of agencies changing policies as long as they do their homework first Professor Levitt says This might be one of the rare instances where the court says the legal standards are very low he adds but the Commerce Department tripped over that low bar The Supreme Court case

majority of Americans believe schools and colleges along with places of worship have become less safe compared with 20 years ago Data from a March survey shows school shootings were more frequent in the 1990s than today Loading nApril 17 2019nn The deadly attack at Columbine High School in 1999 seemed to usher in a new era of school shootings Two decades later polls consistently capture growing fears among American parents that their children face imminent danger whenever they go to school Those fears have only intensified since attacks at an elementary school in 2012 in Newtown Connecticut and last year at a high school in Parkland Florida In the aftermath of the Parkland shooting some research suggests that gun violence is a neardaily experience at schools Other studies indicate that deaths from school violence have actually declined since 1991 A March survey by The Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a majority of Americans believe schools and colleges along with places of worship have become less safe compared with 20 years ago Wide shares of Americans also believe parents the internet and news coverage of similar attacks are at least partly to blame for school shootings About 2 in 10 parents are not at all confident or not very confident in their childs safety while at school About a third of parents are very confident or extremely confident according to the poll But fewer Americans put blame for shootings on schools themselves According to data compiled by Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox who has been researching gun violence for decades school shootings were more frequent in the 1990s than today From 1991 until the Columbine shooting an average of 19 fatal school shootings happened each year with about 22 people killed In contrast over the past eight years an average of about six fatal school shootings happened each year with about 14 killed First of all schools are safe and if you consider the over 50 million schoolchildren and the over 100000 schools that we have the risk of a student or a faculty member being killed by gunfire its extremely low Mr Fox told AP The onehomicideistoomany mantra is quite true Yet when you do the calculations the probability is very small Other data such as that compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety captures a broader spectrum of gunrelated violence including nonfatal shootings and driveby shootings in which the perpetrators do not have a direct connection to the school That research paints a different picture that suggests gun violence  from random gunfire to suicides  is a frequent occurrence Everytown which began tracking school shootings after Newtown notes that attacks such as those at Sandy Hook Elementary School and Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School are not commonplace and represent less than 1 percent of the school gunviolence incidents Mr Fox chalks much of it up to the attention such crimes receive in the news A generation ago there were many fewer cable TV news channels and websites covering the events 24 hours a day One school shooting he cites happened in 1989 when a gunman killed five elementary school students and wounded 32 The shooting in Stockton California is barely remembered Columbine was among the mass shootings in recent decades that sparked the No Notoriety movement an appeal by both guncontrol and gunrights activists to avoid repeated reporting of the names and biographic details of gunmen They hope denying attention to the attackers prevents inspiring a new crop of future shooters The early 1990s were plagued by a high homicide rate overall around the country and thats reflected in school shootings Many of the attacks in that decade were gangrelated Gang warfare spilled out from the streets into the halls of the schools but those shootings were not the type of events that got a lot of attention except for locally Mr Fox said In more recent years most school shootings are either related to perceived bullying or to reasons that cannot be definitively explained Get stories that empower and uplift daily Already a subscriber Log in to hide ads The

at the center of a separation of church and state dispute at the Supreme Court Wednesday n   n      How the court rules could impact similar memorials in towns across the country and even Arlington National Cemetery The justices will have a chance to explain when the government can display religious symbols on public land and clarify the courts somewhat muddled precedent on the issue   n   n      The American Legion built the socalled Peace Cross in 1925 to honor 49 local men who died serving in World War I Mothers of the fallen soldiers designed the memorial to mirror the crosses that mark graves in American cemeteries overseas  n   n      This Memorial Cross Dedicated to the Heroes Of Prince Georges County who gave their lives in the great war for the liberty of the world a plaque reads  n   n      The cross was deeded to the MarylandNational Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1961 after a highway was built around it It stood without conflict until 2012 when nearby residents sued arguing that they are offended by the governments endorsement of religion and the fact that the cross is maintained with taxpayer money  n   nIs Clarence Thomas headed out or just getting startedn n      The fate of the cross that is illuminated at night and hosts annual Veterans Day and Memorial Day celebrations has divided the community  n   n      Last week when two of the plaintiffs stood for an interview in front of the cross explaining their position cars whizzed by and one driver stuck his head out the window yelling Save the cross as he careened around the intersection    n   n      Fred Edwords and Steven Lowe with the support of the American Humanist Association are behind the challenge     n   n      As a memorial to all veterans it only seems to represent  the cross  Christian veterans Lowe told CNN in an interview  n   n      Im not offended by the cross per se What offends me is that its on government land promoting government endorsement of religion and its not my religion Edwords said n   n      But even if it were my religion I would not want my tax dollars used to endorse it he said  n   n      They lost when a district court upheld the cross But in 2017 a panel of judges on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 21 to reverse the decision saying that the government had excessively entangled itself with religion n   n      In arguments before the Supreme Court lawyers for the men argue the memorial should either be moved to private property or modified n   n      But removing the arms of the cross amounts to disfigurement lawyers for the American Legion argue  n   n      That would be an absolute desecration for the gravestone of 49 men who died defending our freedom  under no circumstance can that be permitted said Jeremy Dys general counsel of the First Liberty Institute a group representing the American Legion n   n      Stan Shaw and Mike Moore both of American Legion Post 131 are veterans defending the cross  n   n      Defacing it by taking the arms off or anything of that nature  its just a slap in the face for veterans Shaw said  n   n      I dont see how a static cross can coerce anybody into a state religion said Moore  n   n      Where will this end he asked He said he is concerned that if they lose in court it will end by people trying to take down every reference to God every cross in every memorial that exists in the country  n   n      Indeed 84 House and Senate lawmakers have filed a brief in support of the American Legion arguing that if the court rules against them in the case it could impact other crosses such as two that stand in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia One is the 13foottall Latin cross called the Argonne Cross dedicated in 1923 to the memory of our men in France and another is the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice which stands 24 feet tall and was donated by the Canadian government to honor Americans who died in war  n   n      The Trump administration supports the American Legion and urges the justices to take a historical approach to the case History shows that the Framers understood the Establishment Clause as prohibiting the coercion of religious belief or adherence but not the acknowledgement of religion in public life  Principal Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey B Wall argued in briefs  n   n      He said that passive displays like the Peace Cross fall on the permissible side of the line  n   n      because they typically do not compel religious belief coerce support for or participation in any particular religion or its exercise or represent an effort to proselytize or denigrate any particular faith n   n      On the other side is a friend of the court brief filed by the Freedom from Religion Foundation and other groups that advance the rights of atheists agnostics and nonbelievers  n   n      They argue that when the government selects a single religions symbol to remember war heroes it stigmatizes marginalizes and diminishes those citizens who exercise their constitutional right not to believe or practice the endorsed religion or any religion  n   n      The Supreme Court heard a similar case back in 2005 concerning the Ten Commandments The court allowed a Ten Commandments monument that stood in a Texas public park but it struck down a similar display in two Kentucky county courthouses n   n      The justices could issue a broad ruling that would cover all religious symbols or they could confine their opinion around the specifics of the Peace Cross n   n      Two constitutional lawyers Walter Dellinger and Martin S Lederman suggest in another friend of the court brief that there are discrete contexts when the governments display of religious symbols does not violate the Establishment Clause That includes a symbol on a headstone that corresponds to the deceaseds religion or the Peace Cross  n   n      The lawyers argue the idiosyncratic characteristic of the cross is that the 49 men memorialized were likely all Christian That would mean that the cross can be seen not as religious expression of the state itself but instead a respectful representation of a fact

The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness Follow her on Twitter The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own View more opinion articles on CNNn n      Big ideas Check Complex solutions broken down into digestible sound bites Check Hearttugging anecdotes Check Authenticity In spades n   n      Elizabeth Warren nailed her CNN town hall Monday night And even though shes not getting the breathless headlines of the Bboys  Beto ORourke Bernie Sanders Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg  shes adeptly setting the bar for every other candidate in this race The question now isnt her skill style or substance Its whether shell get fair coverage from a political media eager to glom on to the shiny new thing and unable to give a steady competent woman her due n   nWarrens performance wasnt perfect She answered a question about affordable higher education and the rich being able to buy their way into nearly everything by talking about the influence of money in Washington instead of addressing the college admissions scam in greater depth Sometimes she dodged questions such as when host Jake Tapper asked her specifically about reparations for slavery in the form of cash payments and about the possibility of eliminating private health insurance companiesn   nWarren Im tired of a Washington that works for the richn n      But more often she connected There were multiple times when she seemed near tears When she recounted seeing men women girls and boys in cages near our southern border I found myself watching in jawclenched silence the auditorium too went still and soundless n   n      Later she told the story of her dad nearly dying of a heart attack and her mother who had never worked outside the home donning her best dress to go get a minimum wage job at Sears that kept the family afloat The slightest waver crept into her voice as Warren talked about her own familys past But when she connected it to our political present Today in America a fulltime minimum wage job will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty I am in this fight because I believe that is wrong she got loud  she got mad It was real and it was righteous n   n      Warrens strategy in her campaign and in this town hall is start big and move to the granular In response to question after question she led with a broad valuesdriven idea Health care is a basic human right and we fight for basic human rights we are a country that is built on our differences that is our strength not our weakness I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and to make sure every vote gets counted before outlining a more specific policy plan And much of what she outlined was crucial substantive and careful n   nElizabeth Warrens call to disband tech giants is a step in the right directionn n      She talked a lot about research wanting to get experts and stakeholders in the room to come up with the best plan possible  that was on the table for everything from maternal mortality to reparations for slavery She talked a lot about the impact of race on inequality and the impact of a selfinterested class of highly influential millionaires and billionaires on fueling inequality You can see why she made a great professor It took her just a few sentences to explain her proposal to break up the big tech companies in digestible terms and to get the audience quickly on her side Most viewers I imagine walked away from this town hall having actually learned something n   n      Warrens strength this cycle has come from two places First her ability to think big while actually planning out the details of how to achieve the sprawling policies she proposes and second her aptitude at talking about inequality as a class issue and a race issue and a gender issue n   n      On Monday she told us a little more about who she is including about her faith To be honest I cringed a bit when Tapper asked about the role of faith in Warrens public and private life Too often statements of faith or lack thereof can become a weapon for the religious right to attack progressives such as Warren plus the broad evangelical support enjoyed by a thricemarried philandering habitual liar has pretty much neutered any argument that this segment of the American faithful genuinely cares about morality Nevertheless Warren brought it telling a Bible story with the fluency and vigor of someone behind a Sunday morning pulpit n   n n      Her challenge now is getting her due Media narratives get set early especially it seems for women and hers so far is boring wonk Putting aside that after several years of dramatic cretin boring wonks should perhaps be met with a little more enthusiasm Warrens time on the national stage Monday night showed depth charisma and authenticity all of the things voters say they want and the political press claims to value Those of us with the privilege of platforms and anyone who opines even in the most intimate quarters about the presidential race owes Warren  not the narratives or caricatures or assumptions about electability but the woman herself  a watch and a listenn

Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics Click to subscriben n      Gaetz offered zero proof for his claims of infidelity by Cohen Speaking to reporters outside his office Tuesday evening Gaetz defended his tweet adding that it wasnt a threat He told reporters his tweet wasnt witnesstampering but instead was witnesstesting Gaetz said hes trying to get into Wednesdays hearing to ask questions hes not on the House Oversight Committee and he added that he didnt speak with Trump about his allegationsn   nIn an interview with CBS News after the tweet Gaetz was pressed for evidence of the claim he hinted at on his Twitter feed and he replied As the President loves to say Well see n   n      Its revealing that Gaetz chose to quote Trump in mounting his defense of an indefensible tweet Few  if any  Republican members of Congress have more fully embraced Trumps goforthejugular approach to politics than Gaetz An April 2018 profile of Gaetz in GQ described him as the Trumpiest Congressman in Trumps Washington n   n      Gaetz endorsed Trumps presidential campaign in its earliest days and unlike many skittish Republicans never backed away from that support Following Trumps victory Gaetz has been a willing water boy for the President  pushing conspiracy theories about a deep state within the government targeting Trump and savaging FBI agent Peter Strzok in a House hearing n   n      Gaetz has also become a regular fixture on Trumps preferred communication medium  cable TV  where he has delivered the sort of unapologetic and factually unfounded attacks that please the President to no endn   n      Trump as is his wont repaid Gaetzs blind loyalty with an endorsement of his 2018 campaign while on a July trip to London Tweeted Trump

Cohen Tuesday afternoonn   n      If you think that Gaetzs tweet was just a random act then you havent been paying attention to politics for very long Or well evern   n      What Gaetz was trying to do is intimidate Cohen on behalf of Trump Did Gaetz do so at the behest of Trump or as a solo actor simply trying to impress the President with how far he was willing to go over the line of acceptable conduct I dont know  although I hope when the press corps wakes up with Trump in Vietnam they ask him directly if he talked to Gaetz about the upcoming Cohen hearingn   n      Regardless of what spurred Gaetz to tweet what he tweeted what is not in question is that the Florida Republicans goal was to make Cohen think twice about what he says in front of the House Oversight Committee This is thuggery that should be beneath even someone as brazenly political and calculating as Gaetzn   n      We will not respond to Mr Gaetzs despicable lies and personal smears except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House both Republicans and Democrats will repudiate his words and his conduct Cohen attorney Lanny Davis said I also trust that his constituents will not appreciate that their congressman has set a new low  which in todays political culture is hard to imagine as possiblen   n      When Michael Cohen and Lanny Davis are the voices of moral righteousness you know youve hit a previously unimagined new low in politics Which this moment undoubtedly isn   n      Just before midnight Gaetz tweeted While it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like

upon lines of questioning at Michael Cohens public hearing Wednesday prompting grumbling from several Democrats on the panel who want to press President Donald Trumps former personal attorney about a range of matters related to Russian   nIn a memo to Democrats obtained by CNN the Oversight staff wrote that the committee wants to take great care not to inappropriately interfere with any ongoing investigation or prosecution advising members to consult closely with Committee staff in advance about potential lines of questioningn   n      Those areas outlined in a ninepage memo to the Democratic staff include a range of Trumps conflicts of interests Trump Organization business practices as well as payments to Trumps alleged mistresses to silence their stories before the 2016 electionsn   n      But they do not include a range of topics about Russia instead leaving those matters to Thursdays classified hearing before the House Intelligence Committee an early indication of the tension bound to grow between several powerful House committees all investigating aspects of Trumps lifen   n      Indeed several Democrats on the panel told CNN that the public will get an incomplete picture if Russia topics are closed off given that Wednesdays session will be the only public testimony Cohen will give out his of three congressional appearances this weekn   n      We want to hear about the relationship between Mr Cohen and the President and candidate Trump and so if he were inclined to have a lengthy discussion and an instructive discussion on that then Id like to have him proceed said Rep Stephen Lynch a Massachusetts Democrat on the Oversight panel The way we have it sort of walled off here Im not sure that may be possiblen   nMichael Cohen disbarred in New Yorkn n      Asked about splitting the lines of inquiries between multiple committees Lynch added Im not sure thats the most effective way to do itn   n      The matter has been a topic of closeddoor debate among committee Democratsn   n      According to several sources familiar with a private meeting Tuesday night of committee members and staff lawmakers engaged in a backandforth over whether they can pursue lines of inquiries about Trumps ties to Russia with some noting that there are a range of Russia subjects that could be broached that would not interfere with special counsel Robert Muellers proben   n      But those topics including Cohens admitted lies about the Trump Organizations pursuit of a Trump Tower Moscow project in the heat of the 2016 campaign which were discussed at Tuesdays classified Senate Intelligence Committee hearing will instead be relegated to a private hearing on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committeen   n      Virginia Rep Gerry Connolly a senior member of the Oversight panel told CNN he asked Cummings and his staff at the Monday meeting about the rules of the road He said hes pressing the envelope to see what lines of inquiry could be asked Wednesday on issues related to Russian   n      Does that mean we cant ask about Russian mob money Russian oligarchs The Trump Tower in Moscow that he lied about The Russian oligarchy purchase to Trumps Florida property at a highly inflated price The fact that Russians own apartments in Trump Tower Connolly asked I mean when you say Russia is all of that off limits And that was really the nature of itn   n      Connolly who noted hes also a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee noted that for the past two years under GOP control theyve little opportunity to question witnesses about Russia  and now heres the opportunity to maybe pursue some of thatn   nThis is Michael Cohens momentn n      Last week Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings issued a public memo outlining the scope of the public hearing including Trumps finances his conflicts of interest his foundation and his hotel as allowable topics But the memo did not list topics pertaining to Russia including the Trump Tower Moscow project that Cohen negotiatedn   n      An expanded version of that memo was sent this week to Democratic members along with the instructions to stay within the scope of the hearingn   n      In his memo Cummings said that he consulted with Mueller the Justice Department and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff a California Democrat in deciding the parameters for the public hearingn   n      The scope of the Oversight Committees open public hearing will not include questions relating to the Intelligence Committees investigation of efforts by Russia and other foreign entities to influence the US political process during and since the 2016 US election the memo saysn   n      The memo adds that the public hearing also wont touch the counterintelligence threat arising from any links or coordination between US persons and the Russian government  including any financial or other compromise or leverage foreign actors may possess over Donald Trump his family his business interests or his associates It goes onto say Cohens lies to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project are not under the hearings purviewn   nA highprofile Trump ally in Congress just straightup threatened Michael Cohenn n      Asked Tuesday about some Democratic members eager to ask Cohen about Russia Cummings declined to discuss the matter or the scope of the hearing n   n      Im not going to comment anymore Cummings saidn   n      On Tuesday Schiff praised Cummings handling of the public hearing and defended the decision to split the topics between the committeesn   n      I think thats a good division of labor which will allow the public to get information about the Presidents conduct but will also ensure that we can get complete answers to our questions in the intelligence committee and that we also respect the equities of the Justice Department and our own investigative needs Schiff told CNNn   n      One Democratic source says that the agreement struck by Schiff and Cummings shows the adults in the room were able to successfully resolve legitimate differences over the overlapping interests of the committeesn   n      Asked about Schiffs role Connolly said Its my understanding that he has staked out a role for the intelligence committee that largely subsumes questions about Russian    2022 Cable News Network A Warner Bros

yet another blow to the President who has said he will veto the resolution if it comes to his desk n   n      If four Republicans join all the Democrats in the Senate to pass the resolution the measure would then face a presidential veto The White House formally issued a veto threat on Tuesday afternoonn   n      Congress would then need an overwhelming majority  twothirds of its members  in both chambers to overrule the President It is unlikely that there would be enough support on Capitol Hill to overturn a veton   n      So far there are three Republicans who have signaled they will vote in favor of the resolution And Senate GOP aides fully expect the resolution to pass when it is brought to the floorn   n      GOP Sen Thom Tillis of North Carolina who is up for reelection in 2020 said in a Washington Post oped on Monday evening that he would vote in favor n   n      As a conservative I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future leftwing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms he wrote n   n      Republican Sen Susan Collins a key swing vote also up for reelection in 2020 has said that she plans to vote in favor if it is a clean disapproval resolutionn   n      GOP Sen Lisa Murkowski of Alaska another key swing vote told reporters on Tuesday that she will vote in support of the resolution n   n      During the recent 35day government shutdown the longest such federal shutdown in US history Trump pushed Congress to appropriate 57 billion for physical barriers along the border with Mexico The divided legislature rejected his proposal and the President eventually accepted its bill for 1375 billion in border security measuresn   n      But before signing the bill Trump announced he would go around Congress to get the wall he wanted presenting Republicans on Capitol Hill with a difficult choice While some will support their partys leader on his top campaign issue others argue it could set a poor precedent for future Democratic presidents to push liberal policies without congressional inputn   n      Republican leadership is not worried or upinarms right now about the state of play on the resolution however because they dont view this as a fight to block the resolution They view it as a fight to make sure it stays below a vetoproof threshold and they appear on track for that now n   n      House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has expressed confidence that the GOP would deny votes in the House for a vetoproof majorityn   n      Yes the California Republican said when CNN asked if theyd have the votes to deny a vetoproof majority If you read what the Democrats  say that the emergency is over  no its notn   n      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that he expects the Senate will vote on the resolution before the next Senate recess which will take place the week of March 18 n   n      We will certainly be voting on it he said n   n      McConnell said that GOP senators had a fulsome discussion at their afternoon policy lunch about the legality and appropriateness of the emergency declaration The lunch was attended by Vice President Mike Pence and a lawyer from the Justice Departmentn   n      The Republican leader said he hasnt reached a total conclusion about whether he believes the Presidents emergency declaration is legaln   n      The President has been putting public pressure on Republicans over border security and has urged them not to side with Democrats n   n      I hope our great Republican Senators dont get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security the President tweeted on Monday Without strong Borders we dont have a Country  and the voters are on board with us Be strong and smart dont fall into the Democrats trap of Open Borders and Crimen   nMitch McConnell is on the verge of facing the 18 longest days of his political lifen n      As of Tuesday morning many Republican senators said they were still undecided about how they will vote on the resolution n   n      Sen Martha McSally a Republican from the border state of Arizona and Sen Pat Toomey a conservative from Pennsylvania told CNN they were still looking at their optionsn   n      Republican Sens Tim Scott of South Carolina and David Perdue of Georgia said they planned to vote with the President against a resolution of disapprovaln   n      Republican Sen Lamar Alexander of Tennessee told CNN on Monday he does not support the Presidents emergency declaration but would review the resolution of disapproval before deciding how hed voten   n      I think it is unnecessary unwise and inconsistent with the Constitution said Alexander of the declaration And I feel strongly about thatn   nThis story has been updated

conducted by SSRS that shows a field of four in double digits in the race for the Democratic nomination for presidentn   n      Former Vice President Joe Biden 28 and Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders 20 continue to hold the top slots in the large Democratic field Harris now stands at 12 support among Democrats and Democraticleaning independents up from 4 in December and the latest entrant to the field  former Texas congressman Beto ORourke  stands at 11 n   n      Harriss rise comes across the board  there is no major demographic group in which she lost support since December  but her gains are more pronounced among Democrats 10 points than independents 5 liberals 10 more than moderates or conservatives 7 women 9 more than men 6 and racial and ethnic minorities 10 more than whites 6n   nRELATED Full poll resultsn n      Beyond the top four Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren 6 former Secretary of State John Kerry 4 New Jersey Sen Cory Booker 3 and Minnesota Sen Amy Klobuchar 3 round out the group earning more than 1 support in the poll Another five candidates land at 1 a minimum level candidates must meet in three separate polls in order to be included in the first debates of the cycle later this year n   n      The poll also finds enthusiasm about voting next year already outpaces the level seen for any presidential contest since the turn of this century Four in 10 say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting for president far outpacing early reads in other recent presidential contests CNN first began asking this question in the 2004 election cycle and the previous high point among registered voters was 37 just days before the 2008 election n   n      But unlike last years midterm elections when Democratic enthusiasm propelled the party to a majority in the House of Representatives the energy now is higher among Republicans Nearly 6 in 10 selfidentified Republicans 57 say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting for president compared with 46 among Democrats and 26 among independentsn   n      That could be because its a little easier for a voter to get excited if they have a good sense of who their partys standard bearer will be And Republicans are largely in sync on the president n   n      Threequarters 76 of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents say the party ought to nominate Trump in 2020 a figure that has held roughly steady for the last year Nearly 8 in 10 say the party has a better chance of winning with Trump at the helm 78 than with someone else at the top of the ticket 17 Thats a dramatic reversal from primary season in 2015 when a majority of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents thought the party would have a better chance with another candidate leading the ticketn   nFive takeaways from Elizabeth Warrens CNN town halln n      Almost 6 in 10 Democrats and Democraticleaning independents though see their field as wide open at this point Just 37 say that there are one or two candidates they would prefer to see win the Democratic nomination Among those who do have favorites the top four deepen their advantage 33 in that group back Biden 22 go toward Sanders 13 each choose Harris and ORourke with everyone else testing below 5 n   n      A majority of Democratic leaners say they would rather see the party nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating Trump 56 while 35 say they prioritize a candidates issue positions over electability n   n      That preference for electability appears to work against Sanders most strongly Among those who prefer someone who can beat Trump Biden leads at 32 followed by Harris at 16 Sanders at 14 and ORourke at 11 Those looking for ideological purity are more apt to favor Sanders 31 back him vs 21 Biden 11 ORourke and 7 Harrisn   n      Asked directly whether Democrats have a better chance with Sanders at the top of the ticket or someone else facing off against Trump 56 of Democratic leaners say the partys chances are better without Sanders Asked the same about Biden 51 say the party has a better shot with Biden than without him n   n      Those numbers suggest at least some of the support for Biden and for Sanders is based on something more than just the fact that they are the bestknown candidates in the field But it also does raise the question of whether either will be able to expand on their support as the campaign moves forward and voters get to know their fellow contenders n   n      Bidens support for example hits 30 among moderate and conservative Democrats But compared with December Biden has held about steady while ORourke whose favorability rating with this group grew from 27 to 40 over the same time period gained 5 points in the horserace n   nHere are the Democrats who have said theyre running for presidentn n      It is still possible for these wellknown players to get an announcement bump and as the highestscoring unannounced candidate in the field Biden may yet benefit from making it official n   n      Sanders announced his run on February 19 and his overall standing rose from 14 in December to 20 now His favorability rating remains unchanged among Democrats around threequarters viewed him favorably in December and about the same share say so now but has taken a hit outside the party from 51 favorable and 35 unfavorable in December among all adults to 46 favorable 43 unfavorable nown   n      The poll also finds Democrats and Republicans have completely different issue priorities when thinking about next years election Among Republicans immigration and the economy are the top two issues by far followed by considerations about a candidates ideology or positions on the issues generally On the Democratic side theyre weighing a candidates personal attributes immigration the economy and health care all about evenlyn   n      The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS March 14 through 17 among a random national sample of 1003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 38 percentage points For the subsample of 456 Democrats and Democraticleaning independents it is 57 points and it is 55 points for the subset of 448 Republicans and Republicanleaning independentsn    2022 Cable News Network A Warner Bros Discovery Company All Rights Reserved  CNN Sans

records as part of a sweeping Democraticled investigation into whether President Donald Trump abused his power in office according to a source familiar with the situationn   n      And some former White House officials who received letters from the committee requesting documents including former White House counsel Don McGahn and former deputy counsel Annie Donaldson are referring the inquiries to the White Housen   n      In all Republican aides said the committee had received responses from eight of the 81 officials who received letters from the committee earlier this month and a ninth had mailed documents though they had yet to be received But Democrats said more recipients had agreed to provide documents to the paneln   n      House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler had set a Monday deadline asking for an array of documents  including over the firing of former FBI Director James Comey internal discussions about the decision of thenAttorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia probe details about any talks to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller as well as records about payments Trump made as part of a hushmoney scheme to keep his alleged extramarital affairs from going publicn   n      The source told CNN that the White House has not yet responded though it intends to in the near futuren   n      A spokesman for Nadler declined to comment on the

monthslong battle with Democrats poised to issue subpoenas in their demands for information n   nThe fight over Trump documents is getting heated in the Housen n      Nadlers investigation is stretching into various aspects of Trumps political and business careers focusing on what Democrats believe are corrupt business practices and potential illegal activities at the White House Earlier this month Nadler sent 81 letters to individuals and entities as the first step in his probe including the Presidents sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump former aides like McGahn and business associates like Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg How those individuals responded to Nadlers Monday deadline is unclearn   n      In a statement Monday Nadler said he was encouraged by many of the initial responses though he indicated that the committee would have to issue subpoenas including to some who said they would only comply if they were forced to do so The committee said it had received tens of thousands of documents already and Nadler told MSNBC that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon sent the committee a few thousand documentsn   n      GOP aides said the pages of documents provided so far were just over 8000 Those included 2688 pages from Bannon 3349 pages from Trump donor and friend Tom Barrack 1466 pages from the NRA and 104 pages from Trumps inaugural committee The pages provided to the committee were first reported by Politicon n      Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos former campaign aide JD Gordon former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg and Trump Tower meeting participant Rinat Akhmetshin also provided documentsn   n      Democrats have only provided about 8000 pages of documents received in response to their 81 letters which doesnt approach the claim theyve received tens of thousands of documents said Jessica Andrews a spokeswoman for the committees top Republican Rep Doug Collins of Georgia Either Democrats are deliberately concealing committee records  which confirms theyre invested in partisan inquisitions more than credible oversight  or they are deliberately misrepresenting the facts to the press and American publicn   n      A Democratic aide argued that the Republican list of individuals who responded was incomplete because the committee has negotiated additional agreements to receive documents even if they have not provided them yetn   nSee the more than 80 names receiving House Judiciary Committee letters in its investigationn n      In a statement Monday Nadler said At this point the

how in October 2016 Essential Consultants was established and then how in January 2017 money began to flow in monthly from Columbus Nova LLC The monthly installments were for 83333 and totaled 583332 from January 2017 to August 2017 Why this matters The government in its documents states that LLC is an investment management firm controlled by Renova Group an industrial holding company based in Zurich Switzerland that is controlled by Russian national Viktor Vekselberg Whos that Viktor Vekselberg is an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin who was sanctioned in early 2018 for activities including election interference The sanctions prohibit Vekselberg from traveling to the US Heres the text from the document Clarification The headline of this post has been updated to reflect that Columbus Nova is linked toxa0Viktor Vekselberg rather than controlled by him as described in court documents From CNNs Marshall Cohen Federal prosecutors in Manhattan got permission from a judge to review materials about Michael Cohen that were previously obtained by special counsel Robert Mueller according to documents unsealed on Tuesdayxa0 Specifically the Manhattan prosecutors got permission to review two DVDs and a USB drivexa0full of information that was apparently collected by Muellers team which included what appears to be the legal documents regarding the searches themselves Prosecutors in SDNY took this procedural step out of an abundance of caution according to the court filingsxa0 The DVDs were not collected during the April raid and they do not belong to Cohen One of the DVDs was labeled Cohen  20180307 according to the documents The second DVD was labeled 22818 Cohen SW Returns  Google and 11 according to the records CORRECTION An earlier version of this post said that federal prosecutors retrieved two DVDs belonging to Cohen during the April 2018 raid The DVDs were not actually collected during the April raid and they did not belong to Cohen From CNNs Katelyn Polantz  Special Counsel Robert Muellers office was investigating Michael Cohen for lying to banks breaking foreign lobbying laws and money laundering according to one of the newly released search warrants in Manhattan federal court But note Cohen hasxa0notxa0been charged with illegal foreign lobbying or with money laundering Muellers search warrants  which were approved by a federal judge in DC in the second half of 2017  sought Cohens emails related to his business dealings under a shell company used to cut hush money deals with women accusing thencandidatexa0Donald Trump of extramaritalxa0affairsxa0 Muellers justification for those warrants were several different courses of conduct by Cohen including among other things false statements to financial institutions relating to the purpose of an account he opened in the name of Essential Consultants LLC and the nature of funds flowing into that account and activities undertaken by Cohen on behalf of certain foreign persons or foreign entities without having registered as a foreign agent an FBI investigator wrote to a judge piggybacking on Muellers pursuit From CNNs Erica Orden Michael Cohen withdrew money from his shell company Essential Consultants account for largely personal purposes  including fees from the Core Club which is a private social club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan according to page 26 of exhibit one  Heres the text    From CNNs Katelyn Polantz Manhattan federal prosecutors have kept pages of details secretxa0about their justification for seeking warrants on Michael Cohen related to his close ties to President Trump and thenalleged campaign finance violations for hush moneyxa0payments to women around the 2016 electionxa0 There does not appear to be extensive justification the prosecutors have made visible to the public that describes their reasoning for looking at phone and email communications of Cohen Instead in describing to a federal judge probable cause they had to investigate Cohens campaigntime scheme investigators write almost 20 pages of detail  but theyre are all redacted The Manhattan US Attorney and FBI are investigating a criminal violation of the campaign finance laws by Michael Cohen a lawyer who holds himself out as the personal attorney for President Donald J Trump As detailed there is probable cause to believe that REDACTED they wrote to the judge From CNNs Laura Jarrett   Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is planning to stay on at the Justice Department a little longer than originally anticipated according to a Justice official familiar with his thinking Initially he planned to leave in midMarch but no firm date was ever set and after consulting with Attorney General Bill Barr he willxa0now continue on a bit longerxa0He has not given the White House his two weeks noticexa0 Why this matters Rosenstein has been overseeing the Russia investigation and as CNN has reported he has signaled to other officials that he would leave when he was satisfied that Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation was either complete or close enough to completion that it was protected From CNNs Katelyn Polantz Chief Judge Beryl Howell of DC District Court  whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller asked for warrant approvals related to Michael Cohen  granted approvalxa0on two separate occasionsxa0to track the numbers of Cohensxa0incoming and outgoing phonexa0calls  Those approvals came on Muellers team then handed over that data to the Manhattan federal prosecutors when they referred the case From CNNs Erica Orden  Pg 7 of exhibit 2 establishes that Special Counsel Robert Mueller referred Michael Cohen to federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York on Feb 8 2018 The Cohen raid took place nearly 2 months later to the day on April 9xa0xa0 Heres part of the text    xa0  Prosecutors outlined how they sought to follow screening procedures to ensure that attorneyclient privilege was

United States and Israel started with parents whove chosen not to vaccinate their children according to health authorities Authorities believe that the flight attendant was vaccinated as a child but the vaccine isnt perfect and in her case it didnt work n   n      I knew this was going to happen sooner or later said Dr William Schaffner an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University

children and now its spreading beyond that population n   n      Like many others of her generation around the world the flight attendant who has not been identified received only one dose of the measles vaccine when she was a child n   n      It wasnt discovered until later that one dose is only about 93 effective More recently  in the United States starting in 1989  children have been given two doses which is about 97 effective according to the CDC n   nWhat you need to know about measles as the virus spreads across the country  n n      Its not known why most people who get measles

288,CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/17/americas/venezuela-drug-cocaine-trafficking-intl/index.html,n      Cocaine trafficking from Venezuela to the United States is soaring even as the country collapses And US and other regional officials say its Venezuelas own military and political elite who are facilitating the passage of drugs in and out of the country on hundreds of tiny unmarked planesn   n      A monthslong CNN investigation traced the northward route of cocaine from the farmlands where much of it is grown in Colombia and found that the number of suspected drug flights from Venezuela has risen from about two flights per week in 2017 to nearly daily in 2018 according to one US official This year the same official has seen as many as five nighttime flights in the sky at oncen   n      Planes loaded with Colombian cocaine used to depart from Venezuelas remote southern jungle regions Now they take off from the countrys more developed northwest region to reduce their flying time US and regional officials also saidn   n      Officials involved in combating the deadly trade describe a ridiculously profitable courier system for the Venezuelan government Drug smugglers are more and more exploiting the complicity of Venezuelan authorities and more recently the vacuum of power said one US official Every shipment of cocaine from South America is so lucrative that the planes flown by traffickers are cheap in comparison most are used only once and then discarded or set on fire upon arrivaln   n      A sizable fraction of the profits go to countries through which the drugs pass from the jungles of Colombia through Venezuela and often to the Honduran coastline A confidential 2018 US radar map of the plane routes seen by CNN shows their departure from northwestern Venezuelas Zulia region their passage north to the Caribbean and then their sharp turn West toward their destinations in the remote farmlands of Guatemala on the Honduran coastline and some in the Caribbean From there the drugs are shipped up to Mexico and then distributed to American citiesn   n      One US official estimated that in 2018 alone 240 metric tons 265 tons for US readers of cocaine crossed into Venezuela from Colombia to be flown out of the country Other officials involved in combating the drug trade said that estimate was conservative So much pure Colombian cocaine when cut and distributed could fetch around 39 billion on the streets of the US according to an estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for CNN n   n      US officials recently expressed concern that a proposed ban by President Donald Trump on all types of aid to Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador would create a bonanza among the Venezuelanled traffickers as US aid to these three Central American countries specifically targeted the cocaine trade Right now its wide open said one US law enforcement officer then itll just be a free for alln   n      For years the US has accused highranking Venezuelan officials of drug trafficking Todays accelerating drug trade is a symptom of the urgent need for cash inside Venezuelas crumbling hyperinflation economy and rampant corruption among the Maduro governments senior officials multiple officials said Colombian officials who would rarely be quoted on the record also said that the drug smuggling has recently involved Colombian leftist guerrilla group ELN working with the Maduro militaryn   n      In 2017 former Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami was sanctioned by the US Treasury for overseeing or partially owning narcotics shipments of over 1000 kilograms 2200 pounds from Venezuela on multiple occasions In March El Aissami now Venezuelas minister for industry was indicted in New York for facilitating drug trafficking n   n      He did not respond to the new charges but tweeted two days after they were unsealed LOYAL always ANTIIMPERIALISTS always  PATRIOTS always  CHAVISTAS ALWAYS  WE WILL OVERCOME n   n      In May 2018 Diosdado Cabello the leader of Venezuelas National Constituent Assembly and embattled President Nicolas Maduros number two was also sanctioned for being directly involved in narcotics trafficking activities He has replied there is no evidence of his involvement in trafficking and said of sanctions against him in general If there are persecuted politicians those are the Venezuelan officials sanctioned by the US You can keep your sanctionsn   n      Many other Venezuelan officials have faced similar US accusations which the Venezuelan government has outright rejected They did not comment for this report despite several requestsn   n      Venezuelas scramble for cash owing to hyperinflation caused by economic mismanagement has led to an increase in the risks taken by pilots Another US official said they were often former commercial airline pilots who used to fly passenger jets Thirty planes roughly have crashed in the last threemonth period according to some reports said one US official n   n      The scale of the operation was confirmed by a government official in the region who said the flights use around 50 clandestine runways in the northwestern region of Zulia in Venezuela The drug cargo planes usually fly with the transponders that emit a signal identifying them to radar systems switched offn   n      CNN gained access with the elite Honduran military force known as Fusina to visit areas of Honduras Moskitia region where the drugsmuggling planes from Venezuela land on secret runways  n   n      Tailfin markings on nearly all the planes found by CNN in Moskitia show they originated in the US The first US official told CNN that dozens of planes had been bought at US auctions by shell companies and then shipped southn   n      Some of the planes lay damaged rusting and exposed on the edge of makeshift former airstrips rendered unusable by large craters created by Honduran military explosives Others were hidden submerged in the bend of a river yet visible from the helicoptern   n      Honduran military officers told CNN the traffickers had managed to reach an understanding with local fishermen on how to recover cocaine lost in accidents or interceptions by law enforcement If a smuggler anticipates he might be caught he throws the cocaine overboard attached to a flotation device Such bundles usually weigh 30 kilos 66 pounds and fishermen are paid 150000 if they hand them back to the cartelsn   n      While US technological assistance has helped reduce the number of illegal drug flights coming out of Colombian territory to almost zero traffickers have an easy alternative just across the border in Venezuela One of the problems we face is that the border area is very large Colombian Colonel Mauricio Gonzalez told CNN Weve stopped the flights that try to depart Colombia with drugs but narcotraffickers take advantage of the areas we cannot controln   n      Ongoing tensions in which Colombia has recognized Venezuelas opposition leader Juan Guaido as its interim president meant few Colombian officials would mention Venezuela by name But it was clear that most of the cocaine grown in Colombias Vichada border region is trafficked across the long porous eastern border n   n      The Colombian Air Force flew CNN over Vichada to see the dozens of trochas or tiny pathways along which pure cocaine powder or less refined paste is trafficked Small clearings in the forest where coca leaves are harvested and tiny white shacks  suspected of being cocaine laboratories  were easy to spot n   n      The Colombian helicopters are not allowed to fly closer than five miles to Venezuelas actual border and stay above 2300 feet to avoid risking the machinegun fire of drug traffickers below The helicopter CNN flew in dropped leaflets on the villages below encouraging locals to respect the environment they lived in an oblique code for turning their backs on the drug traden   n      Once inside Venezuela the drugs are then whisked through military checkpoints and escorted or waved on by the army allege US and regional officials and several Venezuelan army defectorsn   n      A defector from the Venezuelan border patrol told CNN that it was once his task to pick out trucks carrying traffickers cocaine and ensure they passed through the border swiftly He said this happened as often as three times a week during the fiveyear period he served in the border regionn   n      The cars that crossed with both weapons and drugs were pickup trucks the defector told CNN hiding his identity and location for fear of reprisals We would be told the color and make of the truck and when it would come  usually at just after dawn or duskn   n      Speaking in hiding with his family in Colombia he said his senior officers provided precise instructions Everything was coordinated by the brigade commander Hed send a lieutenant to tell you what needed to cross and this was arranged high up above Those who didnt agree were swapped out Automaticallyn   n       The defector described how tensions mounted in the early months of 2019 as the power struggle between Guaido and Maduro ramped up inside his border region His unit was almost confined to barracks but permitted to let the vital border contraband continue at pacen   n      We were locked on the base when not on duty he said The general would say Everyone must be with us Leave or speak against the government  youll get arrestedn   n      They had us brainwashed with food handouts he added referring to the subsidized food boxes that help state employees deal with the devastating impact of hyperinflation on family food purchasesn   n      One night I couldnt take it anymore I went home and told my wife We leave for

290,CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/16/opinions/macron-notre-dame-speaking-for-france-opinion-intl/index.html,nEditors Note Marie Le Conte is a French journalist based in London The opinions in this article belong to the author n n      As flames ripped through the roof and into the spire of the Cathedral of Notre Dame on Monday night French President Emmanuel Macron addressed his citizensn   n      Looking distraught he said Notre Dame is our history its our literature its our imagery Its the place where we live our greatest moments from wars to pandemics to liberations  Im telling you all tonight  we will rebuild this cathedral together This is probably part of the French destinyn   n      And perhaps for the first time he spoke for the nationn   nRose windows of Notre Dame are safe but fate of other treasures is unclearn n      Macron never did seem suited to the dull realities of daytoday life He has only been French President for two years and only has been in politics altogether for a few more But it is hard to imagine him anywhere elsen   n      He sauntered into the Élysée while still in his late thirties his mix of intellectual gravitas and childlike arrogance already proving controversial then All has not been well sincen   n      In fact Macron was scheduled to record a televised address on Monday night partly to discuss the concerns of the gilets jaunes  the yellow vest demonstrators whose protests began months ago over fuel tax hike  and the national debates that followed and partly to launch what was dubbed Phase 2 of his presidency a hopeful new start after some unstable monthsn   n      No one knows what the President was going to say or how it would have been received As he was getting ready to record it the Cathedral of Notre Dame caught firen   n      When the images got worse he dropped what he was doing and headed towards the River Seine First he tweeted just after 7 pm local time His message spared a thought for all Catholics and all French people adding that as all our countrymen I am sad to be watching this part of us burn tonightn   n      The wording could have seemed excessive After all Macron has long been derided for his love of pompous allegories and unnecessarily flowery language  and France isnt exactly known for its restraint in that arean   n      Still it seemed to hit the mark for once as did his televised speech later that eveningn   n      It is the way he expresses himself and the way he thinks Simultaneously fascinated by the past and obsessed with the future he seldom appears to be someone comfortable governing in the presentn   n      This has nearly led to his undoing a number of times Appearing distant and with no sincere interest in the dreary real lives of real people he quickly gained the nickname President Des Riches which should speak for itselfn   n      But even this characterization isnt quite right While his policies have been criticized for favoring the betteroff his outoftouch image goes beyond class concernsn   n      Take his initial decision to take a Jupiterian nearly distant approach to the presidency or his revealing comment in an interview during the campaign about French people secretly yearning to be ruled by kings againn   n      This worked for him early on as his predecessors Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande had been profoundly sometimes embarrassingly human But one cannot run a country with sweeping vision alonen   n      It is unclear whether Macron even likes the France that he is in charge of He adores France for its history waxes lyrical about the France shown in its classical literature has a million and one ideas about what France could and should become and how it should present itself to the world But all of these things are not the France that people live and work in todayn   nParis mourns its Lady after Notre Dame infernon n      A country isnt simply the image of a country and Macron has demonstrably struggled when dealing with the more granular aspects of governing Rarely has someone so obviously wished to be leading in poetry while being trapped in tedious prosen   n      Luckily for him the fire that ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral fit squarely into his comfort zone Notre Dame is far more than a building It is a symbol recognized across the country and the world It shows France at its best and the weight of its history in all its shame and gloryn   n      Gen Philippe Pétain was there but so was Charles de Gaulle Napoléon crowned himself emperor within its walls and Victor Hugo made sure its roof would be remembered forevern   n      Countries struggling to know what they stand for can find themselves clinging to the symbolism of inanimate objects and France is no exception It wasnt only a building burning down the melancholy was deeper In this context Macrons grand words felt welcome and appropriaten   n      Back in 2017 only a day after he was elected notquiteyet President Macron was told by Senate grandee Gérard Larcher Its going to feel odd at your age but youre the father of the nationn   n      It hasnt always felt like it and perhaps will never feel like it again But on that Monday evening as Notre Dame was going down in flames Emmanuel Macron did appear to be carrying France on his narrow shoulders and it suited him quite welln    2022 Cable News Network A Warner Bros Discovery

309,Conservative Review,https://www.conservativereview.com/news/sitting-federal-judge-trump-can-compare-kkk-cant-criticize/,Please verify You cannot criticize me ever but I can criticize you Even though youre up for reelection you have no power but I am the final say on all matters even though I am unelected I can disobey higher courts but you cant push back even against a lower court If you dont like it then you are a member of the KKK Who am I Well a federal judge of course Last week a radical federal judge went on a tirade against President Trump ironically criticizing him for criticizing outlandish rulings by federal judges Carlton Reeves an Obamaappointed judge in Mississippi delivered an unprecedented personal attack on the president Typically they wait until retirement for such tirades but Reeves who has been prone to such tirades in his written opinions let loose on what he called the great assault on our judiciary His speech delivered last Thursday night at the University of Virginia School of Law upon receipt of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law was titled Defending the Judiciary A Call for Justice Truth and Diversity on the Bench according to a copy obtained by Buzzfeed  When politicians attack courts as dangerous political and guilty of egregious overreach you can hear the Klans lawyers assailing officers of the court across the South When leaders chastise people for merely using the courts you can hear the Citizens Council hammering up the names of black petitioners in Yazoo City Mississippi thundered Reeves  Evidently he believes that a president who will stand for reelection cannot criticize the decisions of the unelected branch but he who will never face voters can say what he wants In a further twisted stroke of irony about not criticizing judges Reeves blasted Trumps judicial picks for being white and not sufficiently and emphatically declaring their support for judicial precedents he agrees with The irony would be laughable if not for the fact that this dangerous individual still sits on a federal court This is a man who is regularly reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for violating Supreme Court precedent yet somehow he is concerned about precedent Reeves was recently overturned by the Fifth Circuit after he said that Mississippi could not protect business owners from being forced to violate their conscience in serving gay weddings or transgender events The Supreme Court sided with the Fifth Circuit When the powerful accuse courts of opening up our country to potential terrorists you can hear the Southern Manifestos authors smearing the judiciary for simply upholding the rights of black folk accused Reeves Presumably he is referring to Trump and the travel ban But once again the Supreme Court actually upheld that move categorically and said the president had complete power to do so Clearly Reeves doesnt believe in Supreme Court opinions he disagrees with and will continue to disobey them Yet he has the nerve to criticize the leader of a separate branch of government who is not bound by those rulings as a political rule the same way that he is Then again he clearly has no respect for the Supreme Court either In a veiled shot at Supreme Court Justice John Roberts he said It is not enough for judges seeing racebased attacks on their brethren to say they are merely disheartened or to simply affirm their nonpartisan status For those who are unaware of how radical so many of these lower court judges have become the comments of Reeves should offer a glimpse into their worldview They believe that we have one branch of government that controls everything and you are not even allowed to criticize them as a separate branch of government much less push back against their rulings Yet in the ultimate display of intellectual gymnastics they believe the Supreme Court is only binding when they agree with its decisions And even though in their warped view other branches cant push back liberal lower court justices can push back when they disagree This is their onedirectional ratchet whereby lower courts can always be more progressive than the Supreme Court but not less so If you think that lower courts will accept Supreme Court rulings they disagree with let this speech from Reeves be a warning Reeves also said When lawmakers say we should get rid of judges you can hear segregationist senators writing bills to strip courts of their power Thus he is comparing a power vested in Congress in Article III Section 2 to make regulations and exceptions to the jurisdiction of the courts to the KKK Reeves believes that anyone who disagrees with him is assaulting the Constitution but he doesnt believe in the constitutional constraints and checks on his ability to implement his world view unilaterally Read the entire speech for yourself and ask yourself the following question Are you prepared to submit yourself to hundreds of these radical judges having the sole and final say over every aspect of our society Remember that Bernie Sanders Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez have almost no power to implement their ideas But under this unconstitutional practice of judicial supremacy  especially lower court onedirectional ratchet supremacy  a number of people who quite openly share their views now have enough power to singlehandedly create open borders for our entire nation The tragic irony of this entire speech is that Reeves was receiving a Thomas Jefferson reward Perhaps Reeves should educate himself on Jefferson The great founder once said each of the three departments has equally the right to decide for itself what is its duty under the constitution without regard to what the others may have decided for themselves under a similar question Thomas Jefferson as president refused to enforce the Sedition Act of 1798 which made it a felony to print utter or publish  any false scandalous and malicious writing about the government Writing in an 1804 letter to Abigail Adams Jefferson explained his constitutional role as follows  This is what Jefferson thought of judges enforcing laws duly passed by Congress he deemed unconstitutional One can imagine what he would have thought of edicts passed by judges to nullify the immigration marriage and life protection laws duly passed by Congress or a legislature and the inherent obligation of the executive to defend the constitutional law from the unconstitutional judicial edict Reeves seems to invoke equality in every other sentence to justify his racial litmus test for appointing judges He should therefore be well acquainted with the speeches of the great fighter for making the Declaration of Independences ideal of equality a reality during the Civil Warxa0xa0 As Abraham Lincoln said of the false notion of judicial supremacy during his debate with Stephen Douglas when Douglass was suggesting the Dred Scott decision locked up freedom in the territories its a case of thus saith the Lord  Mind you he was referring to the Supreme Court Nobody until this generation could have imagined we would lock up our border control election law life marriage and oil because of an insidiously forumshopped district judge Reeves closed his screed by noting that We do Jefferson justice we do the martyrs of Mississippi justice we do our country justiceby defending our judiciary Now more than ever One could not possibly be more historically or constitutionally illiterate than Reeves by making this remark Jefferson lamented in 1823 that there is no danger I apprehend so much as the consolidation of our government by the noiseless and therefore unalarming instrumentality of the Supreme Court Even Jefferson could never have imagined several hundred lower court judges like Reeves who would wield such power to twist and shape the Constitution into any form they may please like he feared with the Supreme Court Are we really prepared to surrender our Constitution to men like this thereby making our republic a government of unelected men rather than one of laws                         YOU ARE A BOT  We use cookies to better understand

310,Conservative Review,https://www.conservativereview.com/news/gillibrand-pushes-commonsense-gun-reforms-campaign-trail-many-already/,Please verify At a campaign stop late last week in New Hampshire Sen Kirsten Gillibrand DNY said a lot of things about gun laws and legislation that were just plain not true In response to a schoolteachers question about gun control Gillibrand said  And unfortunately because the gun manufacturers only care about gun sales they oppose the commonsense reform that can save lives They want to oppose universal background checks because they want to sell an assault rifle to a teenager in a Walmart or to someone on the terror watch list or to someone who is gravely mentally ill with a violent background or to someone with a criminal conviction for a violent crime They want to sell those weapons thats why they oppose universal background checks Heres a clip in the tweet below video of the full event is available on CSPAN The action starts at the 3300 mark   Gillibrand continued   This is the definition of corruption It is the definition of greed And they have a chokehold on Congress unlike anything Ive ever seen And so commonsense members of Congress that youd think would be for these things arent because theyre so afraid of the NRA Thats a lot of ground to cover Here are the facts  First off the NRA doesnt spend that much money at all compared to other national advocacy groups Its real strength lies in the fact that there are a ton of people in this country who believe that the Second Amendment exists for a reason To try to simply blame widespread Second Amendment support on corporate greed and monetary influence is either lazy misinformed or plain dishonest Now lets address universal background checks Every single retail transaction ie the kinds of transactions that result directly in gun manufacturer profits requires a federal background check The universal background check legislation currently passed by the Democratic House would only extend background check requirements to transactions between private individuals If gun makers were only looking out for their bottom line they would support anything that makes it more difficult for people to sell used guns to other people So her talking point makes no sense Even crazier she also seems to ignore the fact that the NRA backed the creation of the National Instant Background Check System NICS used every time a gun is purchased from a federal dealer Now lets talk about those groups of people that the gun makers supposedly want to sell to Felons people with domestic violence convictions people who have been adjudicated as a mental defective and people who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions are already barred from buying firearms by federal law And its illegal for anyone to sell to them whether a dealer or a private seller As far as selling assault rifles to teenagers at retail stores if you mean automatic weapons youre not going to see those available over the counter for civilian purchase anywhere If you want to actually own one of those youd better be prepared to jump through a lot of prohibitive hoops do some antique shopping and shell out some big bucks Yes 18 and 19yearolds can legally buy semiautomatic long guns with modular capabilities and aesthetics that look scary to the uninitiated Of course those are not assault rifles But it is illegal under federal law for anyone under the age of 18 to buy a long gun from a dealer regardless of how scary or nonscary it looks to antigun activists Now lets talk about that antitrafficking law that Gillibrand mentioned This is a talking point that doesnt make much sense if youre familiar with the laws already on the books Its already illegal under federal law to purchase a gun with the intention of giving it to someone who is barred from purchasing it and theres a maximum 10year sentence attached Furthermore all gun transfers across state lines must go through federally licensed dealerswho yes must perform background checks Its hard to tell if antigun politicians are outright lying to voters or if they actually believe the misleading propaganda they are eagerly spreading to support their gun control agenda What makes it even more embarrassing for Gillibrand in this case is that shes trying to run from her past support of the Second Amendment and even once boasted of keeping rifles under her bed Politicians who want to legislate against the Bill of Rights should at least have their facts straight first about all the laws we already do have to keep guns out of the hands of the incompetent or criminal                         YOU ARE A BOT  We use cookies to better understand website visitors for advertising and to offer

313,Conservative Review,https://www.conservativereview.com/news/not-building-wall-building-will/,Please verify On Wednesday President Trump acting in response to the fear that Boeing 737 MAX planes may be unsafe to fly due to two similar accidents issued an emergency order through the FAA administrator to ground the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 from flying in and out of our country No questions were asked Yet almost a year into an invasion of unimaginable security cultural health care and fiscal concerns we are told that unless there are 60 votes in the Senate and every district judge agrees  something that will never happen even after Republicans win in 2020  there is nothing Trump can do with his executive and delegated authority to grind all illegal immigration to a halt This is simply not true Its time to build the will even more than the wall The openborders movement began with the premise that we must grant amnesty to those who successfully evaded deportation for 20 years and have put down roots here However nobody throughout our history even recent history suggested that we sit idly and import millions of new illegal aliens and refuse to deport a single person among those who just come in and abscond from their court appearances Yet that is whats happening now and we are all acting as if we need 91 district courts and 60 senators in order to protect our country  Its all a matter of will We have never had such a severe and blatant invasion through migration last this long without the president implementing a plan to shut it down During the Mariel boatlifts of Cubans in 1980 the Nicaraguan influx into Texas in 1989 the Haitian boat migration in the early 1990s and even the first Central American surge under Obama in 2014 the various presidents eventually took action to shut down the flow even without an immediate legislative fix After two months of Cuban boatlifts in May and June 1980 totaling more than 100000 aliens the flow was shut off to a trickle and eventually ended by the fall In 1989 after tens of thousands of Nicaraguans came in and demanded asylum a rocket docket was set up in tent cities in south Texas to immediately adjudicate their cases and ship them out During the Haitian sea migration in the early 1990s Presidents Bush and Clinton sent out the Coast Guard to prevent them from landing and returned them home immediately In Sale v Haitian Centers Council Inc 1993 a case Chief Justice Roberts just referenced in his favorable opinion to Trump in the travel ban case the Supreme Court made it clear that presidential power to exclude all aliens at the border overrides even asylum requests Yet here we are today with the invasion now so bad that the cartels and smugglers have created a transport system to streamline more migration than ever and incentivize more Central Americans to come without fear of a harsh journey The Washington Post reports that Mexican smugglers have now set up a conveyor belt system of express buses to minimize overhead and maximize capacity creating the biggest incentives to come in the largest numbers We have never had such an orchestrated invasion by so many terrible human beings involved with violent cartels taking advantage of people on both sides of the border so efficiently The numbers have been much greater than any previous sudden influx of asylum seekers and it has been going on much longer without any effort to shut it down If we add the number of family units and unaccompanied children who came here from the Central American countries since 2014 the tally is approaching one million Almost none of them have been deported except for the brief period when Obama was shutting off the first wave in 2014 Now there is no bottom in sight to this insanity if the president doesnt set one now While some might not view hundreds of thousands of impoverished unassimilable migrants as an invasion the weaponizing of migration by the organizers of these caravans is certainly making this an invasion just like Castro did when he weaponized migration against us with the Mariel boatlift Both in terms of the antiAmerican organizers of the caravans and the Mexican cartels who use the migrants as distractions to get in dangerous criminals and drugs this is definitely an orchestrated event to take advantage of poor migrants to harm America In some ways the effects are more irreversible than those of a traditional invasion If Boeing which is directly the subject of Trumps FAA order sued in a district court and a forumshopped judge put an injunction on the order would this administration allow these planes to fly Now imagine a judge usurping the power to grant standing to foreign caravans or thirdparty groups representing them No other president in any other era would allow this to go on The language of the relevant statute section 212f of the INA is as clear as can be Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate Trump can halt all immigration and crossborder commerce for any reason if he determines its in the national interest This is no weaker and in fact is much stronger than the authorizing statute to ground planes When the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is of the opinion that an emergency exists related to safety in air commerce and requires immediate action the Administrator on the initiative of the Administrator or on complaint may prescribe regulations and issue orders immediately to meet the emergency with or without notice and without regard to this part and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 49 US Code u202f46105 Its time for the president to completely halt all acceptance of any credible fear claims at our border and immediately turn back anyone coming here The Constitution and statute are on Trumps side Its also time for the administration to play diplomatic hardball with Mexico NAFTA should be renegotiated again with the top priority focused not on trade issues but over Mexico holding any Central American migrants The reality is that this move if sustained would not need to continue indefinitely because the Central Americans will stop coming once they know they cant come to the United States They have no interest in flooding Mexico as an endpoint Those who manage to get in anyway should be sent to tent cities with a rocket docket of immigration judges at the front lines as we did during past migration influxes Trump has no choice but to assert commonsense powers already upheld by the Supreme Court numerous times What is he waiting for Nothing will change with this election even in the bestcase scenario Republicans and certainly not conservatives will not secure 60 votes in the Senate even if they win back control of the House and Trump is reelected This invasion will continue to spiral out of control yet pigs will fly before Congress will act And as Ive noted before passing new laws wont even help anyway because the judicialsupremacy courts are asserting that Trump cant follow existing laws of the Immigration and Nationality Act INA Congress can never write a statute more unambiguous and granting the president more unconditional power to shut off even legal immigration than 212f We either have the will to be a sovereign nation or we dont Everything else is just an excuse and a distraction                            YOU ARE A BOT  We use cookies to better understand website

316,Conservative Review,https://www.conservativereview.com/news/gop-senators-push-double-decker-welfare-program/,Please verify President Trump needs to be reelected in 2020 but the Republican Party makes it harder to do so when they mimic the lunatic Left As a grassroots conservative the most frustrating thing to have to deal with come election time is to promote a candidate or back a Republican for reelection to gain or maintain a majority when you know darn well that candidate or incumbent could backslide into the stupid and inexplicable positions owned by the Left We actually have a president who has identified the problem when he famously said America will never be a socialist country We are at a point in time where the Left is no longer hiding the fact that they are socialists and unfortunately too many of the American populace are already or on their way to being convinced that topdown government control of their lives is exactly what theyve been waiting for  But why oh why do we have to sit here and watch the Republican Party champion socialism while we have the winning message that socialism will destroy America I could not believe my eyes when I read that Senators Mike Lee RUtah and Joni Ernst RIowa actually proposed a paid family leave act with the acronym CRADLE Who read that and didnt think cradle to grave And as we are trying to point out how terrible socialism is the senators their aides and their mouthpieces in the media are trying to make the program less terrible by saying its revenue neutral  Its no problem they tell us See the money will come out of the persons own Social Security account and itll be like taking some vacation pay early thats all And besides the American people want it so we should make sure were out in front on this issue you know to show we care Theyre going to build another socialist program off of another socialist program A doubledecker And here I thought the SSA Trustees had been telling the American people that Social Security will be depleted by 2034 and Social Security Disability Insurance sooner than that I thought that as conservatives were supposed to encourage people to rely on themselves and not the federal government I thought that Social Security was the first big socialist program that the progressives foisted upon us and we are still trying to figure out how to keep the promises those lying progressives made I thought that this socialist program was in trouble the minute people started living longer and the Boomer generation reached the age of 65 What about the fact that most people who would need the money are the ones least likely to have any to speak ofThe example put forth to sell this plan discussedxa0new parents in their 30s who would be able to draw from their Social Security for three months to be with their newborn But wouldnt it be more likely that the people in their late teens and early twenties would be the ones that would be less established and need the money They would be the ones who also havent worked enough to build up much of a Social Security bank either Provided there were such a thing as a Social Security bank which there isnt The Washington Examiner points out that particular concern of mine isnt going to be a problem for the couple in their teens and early twenties  So its another welfare program But I thought the Republicans are saying its not another welfare program Just saying why do the people who put considerably less into the system automatically get more out of it percentagewise Why do Republicans do this Does any of this help people take care of their own responsibilities We already have numerous nutritional programs and healthcare programs to help the young parents who struggle We as Republicans get beat on the head every single time the Left brings up our aversion to entitlements but we never fight back with the fact that we have so many programs between the federal and state government intended to be used as safety nets when they are needed and then gotten the hell off of when people can do it themselves But this whole program is a welfare program on top of an extremely shaky welfare program and some Republicans are gleeful because it doesnt start up a new tax It will tax our Social Security system which just last year became insolvent when the total cost of the program exceeded its total income Yet Republicans think starting up another progressive social program on top of it will benefit future generations How so                         YOU ARE A BOT  We use cookies to better understand website visitors for advertising and to offer you a better experience For more information about our use of cookies our collection use and disclosure of personal information generally and any rights you may have to access delete or opt out of the sale of your personal information please view our Privacy Policy,1

318,Conservative Tribune,https://www.westernjournal.com/ap-abortion-tennessee-lawmakers-advance-fetal-heartbeat-bill/,A bill that would ban most Tennessee women from obtaining abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected cleared a key hurdle Tuesday advancing for a full House vote in the GOPdominated legislature The move comes amid a national movement by prolife lawmakers and activists who hope that President Donald Trumps appointments to the Supreme Court will increase their chances of ending or severely restricting legal abortions Tennessee is among several states with pending bills to ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected about six weeks into pregnancy The goal is to trigger a legal challenge to the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion Court rulings since then have determined states cannot place undue burdens on abortion before a fetus is viable  typically between 24 and 28 weeks This is an issue that has been on my heart my whole life Rep Micah Van Huss a Republican sponsoring the bill said during Tuesdays hearing I aim to save babies lives The House Health Committee voted 154 to send the legislation to the House floor for a full vote sparking heavy applause from supporters Only Democratic members voted in opposition While the bill still has to clear the House floor and the Senate it is expected to win support from Republicans Furthermore firstterm Gov Bill Lee has promised his support if the bill reaches his desk Advocates on both sides of the issue packed the room to watch lawmakers spar over possible legal challenges and discuss hypothetical situations of women being forced to carry a baby to term even in cases of rape or incest By the meetings close many were breaking out in cheers and jeers in response to lawmakers comments I have three girls Ive raised them to be independent so no boy tells them what to do Well except for me said Democratic Rep Darren Jernigan But Ive also said theyre in control of their bodies and it bothers me the government would tell them what to do and it bothers me the bill is likely unconstitutional When asked if it would be acceptable for a 15yearold student who was raped by her coach to be barred from having an abortion if she was past the sixweek viability marker because a fetal heartbeat was detected Van Huss simply said yes He responded similarly when asked if he agreed that the same ban should be in place in cases of incest It is not up to me to determine someone elses life Van Huss said Critics of the bill predict enactment would trigger an immediate legal challenge warning that an Iowa judge struck down a similar law last month In Mississippi a federal judge declared banning abortion after 15 weeks was unconstitutional On the one hand sensibly speaking this is unconstitutional and its going to cost taxpayers dollars While on the other hand litigation would most surely help to uphold Roe v Wade as the continued law of the land for womens health and privacy protections said Francie Hunt executive director of Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood Even the states top antiabortion group Tennessee Right to Life has opposed the bill due to the surrounding legal concerns In 2017 the group testified before lawmakers that its opposition stemmed from Supreme Court rulings banning criminalizing abortion prior to viability Right to Life has been more subdued in airing concerns surrounding this years bill arguing Tennessee should let other states fight the legal battle The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee has already vowed to fight the legislation in court A woman should be able to make decisions about what is best for her health and her family in consultation with her doctor and her loved ones without politicians interfering or trying to force her hand Hedy Weinberg the groups executive director said in a statement If this bill passes the ACLU of Tennessee stands ready to file a lawsuit immediately The Western Journal has reviewed this Associated Press story and may have altered it prior to publication to ensure that it meets our editorial standards We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism  Read our editorial standards,1

328,Conservative Tribune,https://www.westernjournal.com/ap-records-show-fbi-was-probing-michael-cohen-long-before-raid/,Hundreds of pages of court records made public Tuesday revealed that special counsel Robert Mueller quickly zeroed in on Michael Cohen President Donald Trumps former personal attorney and fixer in the early stages of his Russia probe The heavily blackedout records released by a judge at the request of news organizations show that Mueller was investigating Cohen by July 2017  much earlier than previously known That was two months after Mueller was appointed to investigate Moscows election interference and practically a year before an FBI raid on Cohens home and office The full scope of Muellers interest in Cohen is not clear from the documents which include search warrant applications and other records More extensive files from the special counsel investigation remain under seal in Washington But the documents made public Tuesday show that Muellers investigators early on began looking into possible misrepresentations Cohen made to banks to shore up his financially troubled taxi business They were also initially interested in money that was flowing into Cohens bank accounts from consulting contracts he signed after Trump got elected Prosecutors were looking into whether Cohen failed to register as a foreign agent Some of the payments he received were from companies with strong foreign ties including a Korean aerospace company a bank in Kazakhstan and an investment firm affiliated with a Russian billionaire By February 2018 though the records show Mueller had handed off portions of his investigation to federal prosecutors in Manhattan And by the spring of 2018 those prosecutors had expanded their investigation to include payments Cohen made to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels and a Playboy centerfold both of whom claimed to have had affairs with Trump The newly released documents indicate authorities continue to probe campaign violations connected to those hush money payments Nearly 20 pages related to the matter were blacked out at the direction of a judge who said he wanted to protect an ongoing investigation by New York prosecutors Where that investigation is headed is unclear But prosecutors have said Trump himself directed Cohen to arrange the hush money The president has denied any wrongdoing Cohen ultimately pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations over those payments He also pleaded guilty to tax evasion making false statements to banks and lying to Congress about Trumps plans to build a skyscraper in Moscow He was not charged with failing to register as a foreign agent He is scheduled to begin serving a threeyear prison sentence in May Lanny Davis an attorney for Cohen said Tuesday that the release of the search warrants furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress The FBI raided Cohens Manhattan home and office last April  the first public sign of a criminal investigation that has proved an embarrassment for Trump The newly released records show that several months earlier in July 2017 Muellers office got a judge to grant him authority to read 18 months worth of Cohens emails In their investigation Muellers prosecutors also obtained Cohens telephone records and went so far as to use a hightech tool known as a Stingray or Triggerfish to pinpoint the location of his cellphones FBI agents also scoured Cohens hotel room and safe deposit box and seized more than 4 million electronic and paper files more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads 20 external hard drives flash drives and laptops Both Cohen and Trump cried foul at the time over the raids with Cohens attorney calling them completely inappropriate and unnecessary and the president taking to Twitter to declare that Attorneyclient privilege is dead A courtordered review ultimately found only a fraction of the seized material to be privileged Tuesdays release of documents came nearly six weeks after US District Judge William H Pauley III partially granted a request by several media organizations including The Associated Press that the search warrant be made public because of the high public interest in the case But he ordered certain material withheld acknowledging prosecutors concerns that a wholesale release of the documents would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties The unsealed records provide significant insight into the investigations of Michael Cohen and serve as an important safeguard for public accountability APs director of media relations Lauren Easton said Tuesday David E McCraw vice president and deputy general counsel for The New York Times which initiated the request for the documents said he is hopeful Pauley will approve the release of additional materials

329,Conservative Tribune,https://www.westernjournal.com/ap-democrats-strain-to-claim-they-have-2020-fundraising-chops/,Washington Gov Jay Inslee little known outside his home state boasts he raised over 1 million in the days after launching his White House bid Former Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper and others say they did too Impressive numbers even if dwarfed by the 6 million or so reported by Bernie Sanders and now Beto ORourke The sevendigit figures for the lesserknown Democratic hopefuls dont lie but they dont tell the whole story either Early bursts of donations dont happen by accident especially for candidates with little national name recognition such as Inslee who hit his target thanks in part to an email list of donors hes cultivated for months Hes among a crowded field of more than a dozen Democrats who are feverishly trying to show they can raise big money and realistically challenge Republican President Donald Trump With the firstquarter fundraising deadline looming some are straining credulity to give the impression of a spontaneous groundswell of support In addition to Inslee and Hickenlooper Minnesota Sen Amy Klobuchar and California Sen Kamala Harris have boasted they raised 1 million or more in the hours and days after launching their campaigns What that signifies is less clear Its a strange goal post for viability and there are a lot of tricks you can use to come up with that number said Tim Lim a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clintons and Barack Obamas campaigns However he added Its a great talking point So how do you get to 1 million within 24 48 or 72 hours Candidates like Vermont Sen Sanders and former Texas Rep ORourke have used their star power to quickly raise astronomical sums ORourke announced on Monday that he edged Sanders by pulling in 61 million in the 24 hours after his launch But a wide range of tools are available to help the lesserknown White House hopefuls They include rented fundraisings email lists targeted social media ads which all candidates use and revenue sharing agreements which allow interest groups to raise money for their own causes while splitting it with a favorite candidate Fundraising commitments are often lined up in advance while creative accounting maneuvers can be used to pad the bottom line Senators have a leg up They can take money from existing federal campaign accounts while governors are largely barred from doing the same with their state accounts Before his early March launch Inslee spent months running targeted ads that asked Facebook users to fork over their email addresses to join his fight against climate change  now the signature issue of his campaign At the same time Inslee who was then head of the Democratic Governors Association made prospecting trips to states including New York and California He started collecting larger checks from conventional donors in the weeks before the launch Then shortly after announcing his run his campaign blasted out thousands of fundraising emails and the online money started to roll in which he juiced by making rounds on the talk show circuit Within about three days he reached the magic 1 million figure  and his campaign issued a news release The fundraising effort was described by two Inslee aides who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the inner workings of his campaign Michael Duncan a Republican digital strategist said numbers posted by lesserknown candidates are likely to be less grassroots and more the campaign equivalent of AstroTurf But Duncan who formerly handled digital strategy for the insurgent tea party group FreedomWorks said it was a shrewd tactic Particularly now that the Democratic National Committee is using online fundraising with an emphasis on lowdollar contributions spread out across many donors to qualify for the debate stage I would imagine the grassroots support is manufactured said Duncan who also was an architect of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus digital strategy in 2015 Id doubt theyd own a file of hundreds of thousands of Americans dying to give them 10 Most campaigns wont offer specifics on how they reached their mark News releases sent out at the time shed some light however Harris offered the most detail Her campaign announced in January that it raised 15 million in 24 hours collecting an average donation of 37 from more than 38000 people From there it gets more fuzzy Klobuchars campaign said it raised 1 million in 48 hours from online and grassroots supporters in all states but did not break the numbers down further Inslee launched his campaign on a Friday and announced the following Monday that he had reached the mark with donations coming from all 50 states Hickenloopers campaign said it reached the figure in less than 48 hours and received donations from all 50 His campaign wouldnt offer specifics But touting the number was a nobrainer said spokeswoman Lauren Hitt Of course we thought it was important in our launch to show he is the morethanviable candidate we know she said Though 1 million is a lot to most raising that much isnt as difficult as it may seem It could be reached if about 357 donors cut checks for the 2800 primary maximum And lining up support from longtime donors in advance could go a long way toward getting a candidate close Zac Moffatt Mitt Romneys 2012 digital director said the focus now will be whether they can keep it up The question would be what is Act II he said The Western Journal has reviewed this Associated Press story and may have

his home in Virginia made him too Washingtonfocused to serve his district OcasioCortez had claimed her deceased fathers condo in Parkchester as her residence since 2012 but the Post couldnt find any evidence she actually spent very much time there Her nextdoor neighbor claims to have never laid eyes upon her at least not in the building Several local businesses including the local supermarket say theyve never seen her either People at a local taqueria actually say that theyve seen her  but only when shes taking photos for the press A postal worker who delivers mail to the building said that in the last 10 years he has only seen OcasioCortez intermittently and that several months worth of mail regularly accumulates in the mailbox before anyone bothers to collect it The worker said that OcasioCortez and boyfriend Riley Roberts were the only ones getting mail at the address the Post reported Just because their names are on the box doesnt mean they live there he told the Post In a followup story published Sunday the Post reported that OcasioCortez spokesman Corbin Trent said she had moved to a new apartment a block and a half away He declined to give the address In a Twitter post published Sunday OcasioCortez cited the arrest last week of a Coast Guard lieutenant accused of compiling weapons and a hit list of prominent Democrats including OcasioCortez as a reason to keep her location information under wraps I still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight A man was just arrested last week with a stockpile of guns specifically trying to kill me  others so yeah Im not gonna disclose my personal address or tell people when I move Sorry  Alexandria OcasioCortez AOC February 25 2019  I still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight she wrote A man was just arrested last week with a stockpile of guns specifically trying to kill me  others so yeah Im not gonna disclose my personal address or tell people when I move Sorry Regardless since Trent said the move took place earlier this month it doesnt explain why OcasioCortez alleged neighbors havent seen her around for years This isnt the first time questions have arisen about the OcasioCortez residency  shes apparently even had them herself The Post noted that she had actually filed paperwork to run in the neighboring congressional district New York District 15 before she got the right one Thats an error Joe Crowley probably wishes would have gone uncorrected Theres also the fact that OcasioCortez has yet to open up a local district office a fact that she blames on the landlord for her predecessor attempting to double the price of the lease Unfortunately theres actually not much that can be done so long as OcasioCortez actually lives in the state Heres what the Constitution says about requirements for serving in the House of Representatives No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States and who shall not when elected be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen Emphasis added In fact The Washington Post reported in June 2017 that during the last Congress it could find at least 21 representatives who were registered to vote outside their district Thats not entirely the point though The Bronx address has added to the OcasioCortez mythos Shes a woman of the people one of the Bronxs own Until shes not of course And according to the Post shes gone to cartoonish lengths to conceal any information about where she might actually live when shes in New York The Post contacted the representatives office with specific questions including where she lived Her staffers originally said they wouldnt be commenting but they appeared to change their mind On Saturday night a staffer promised a Post reporter that OcasioCortez would talk to him after a speaking event in Corona the Post reported During the event two staffers were seen reading an early edition of this story on their phones Come downstairs I have to take a picture quick the congresswoman then told the reporter after the event instructing him to wait for her Twenty minutes later she ducked out a back door jumped into a chauffeured SUV and zoomed off To the Bronx one presumes We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism

340,Crooks and Liars,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/03/sen-kirsten-gillibrand-reminds-crowd-al,UPDATE Breaking  There are accusations that Kristen Gillibrand did not take sexual harassment in her own office seriously   It was announced today that Gillibrands deputy chief of staff is resigning over the controversy   eds People are still understandably very very upset that Al Franken is no longer a US Senator He was serious smart and absolutely lethal in his questioning during Senate Judiciary hearings His priorities were and are progressive and his approach was unique Refreshing Welcome To almost everyone It sounds like at least six or seven women who came forward with stories of their experiences of his groping or kissing them without their permission didnt welcome his approach From Vox They described specific detailed incidents in which he put his hands on their behinds or breasts during photos Others recalled him trying to forcibly kiss them Franken apologized repeatedly but said he wasnt sure if hed done the things he was sorry might have happened I take thousands and thousands of pictures sometimes in chaotic and crowded situations he said I cant say I havent done that Im very sorry if these women experienced that Now lets talk about this for a moment This chaotic and crowded situation Franken was so often in as an entertainer and politician Schwepps yes the soda company did a very interesting study regarding unwanted touching and groping in crowded situations They created a sensorequipped dress to monitor how often a woman was touched or groped in a bar without her consent and where on her body Three different women wore the dress over the course of the evening Women around the world have long reported that men strangers included touch them all the time without permission much less an invitation Even when asked not to Its a particularly invasive form of objectification Isnt everyone supposed to be entitled to personal space The results The women were touched or groped without invitation or permission a total of 157 times in just under four hours in spite of and over the womens objections Thats nearly 40 times an hour Once every minuteandafraction This is the sort of thing that is consistently dismissed belittled laughed at and that women are told they are too sensitive if they object Now if you still think that is nothing to complain about I will personally meet you at a party and touch you on your nose every 70 seconds Thats not even sexual Lets see how you like it Back to Al Franken he couldnt say he hadnt done it He was sorry if these women experienced his groping and uninvited kissing Including an Army Veteran in 2003 by the way who had lined up to take a photo with Franken during his USO tour When he put his arm around her she claims he cupped her right breast for around 10 seconds only stopping because she had to change positions for the photo As these allegations came to light Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and 30 of their colleagues called for his resignation He acquiesced despite the fact he could have very easily remained for the ethics investigation to finish Many lament this end to Frankens Senate career and possibly his 2020 presidential bid should he have had those aspirations    Ironically many have also determined it will end Gillibrands 2020 presidential bid since they continue to hold incredible anger and resentment towards HER for having pressed the matter and being willing to lead the call for his resignation   Indeed Gillibrand is continuing to be challenged on the campaign trail about this matter and if social media comments are any indication the challenges are accompanied by tremendous hostility and resentment This despite the fact that Franken has not responded to several of the allegations of groping and in his resignation speech he said he denied some of them and remembered other of the womens claims very differently  For some Gillibrand is somehow the villain not Franken Heres her accounting of the situation and the reasoning that led to the decisions she made   In terms of Senator Franken this is a very hard issue for so many Democrats because the truth is we miss him and people love him But he had eight credible allegations against him of sexual harassment for groping Two of them since he was a senator and the eighth one that came out was a Congressional staffer And I had a choice to make whether to stay silent or not whether to say its not okay with me and I decided to say that Now Senator Franken was entitled to whatever type of review or process he wanted He could have stuck it out stayed in the Senate gone through his Ethics Committee investigation for as long as he wants He could have sued all of the eight women who came out against him Those were his choices but I had to make my choice I am a mother of boys the conversations I was having at home at the time were very upsetting Theo said Why are you so tough on Al Franken As a mother I had to be clear Its not okay for anyone to grope a woman anywhere on her body without her consent It is not okay to forcibly kiss a woman  ever  without her consent it was not okay for Senator Franken And it is not okay for you Theo ever So I needed to have clarity If there are few Democratic powerful donors who are angry because I stood up for women who came forward with allegations of sexual harassment thats on them Id like to harken back to Frankens final Senate speech againwhere he asks those who love him not to worry This has been a tough few weeks for me But I am a very very lucky man I have a beautiful healthy family that I love and that loves me very much I am going to be just fine Boy isnt that the truth Over one year later and people are still crying over having lost him in the Senate despite the tremendous strides women have made politically in the last year and a half Despite the fact that we have five count them FIVE women running for the Democratic 2020 nomination Despite the fact that we have since he resigned still managed to take the House and run Trump into the ground with the investigations thanks to some of those Democraticallyled committees Of what exactly has Senator Gillibrand deprived us other than shaky moral ground Al Franken was right He is going to be just fine Please note that misogynistic terms and commentary are not

342,Crooks and Liars,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/03/nyt-journalist-stop-mincing-words-trump,Wajahat Ali called for  dare I say it  accuracy in reporting on Trumps bigotry and it was a beautiful thing He put those who refuse to call Trump what he is  a racist and antiSemite  on blast Stop using soft language around it Who benefits from it Only the racists Only the antiSemites This righteous tirade came after Chris Hayes asked the NYT journalist about in particular what he made of the silence of Trump in the face of the awful New Zealand terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 50 innocent Muslims at prayer ALI Its the feature not the bug Lets not forget when it came to Charlottesville and there were white supremacists KKK and the altright who repeated the white supremacist conspiracy theory that Jews will not replace us Donald Trump responded by saying there are very fine people and both sides are to blame And when its come to this terrorist attack in New Zealand which has claimed fifty lives including a threeyearold baby its been five days Chris and Donald Trump has yet to use the t word terrorism to describe it In fact he has yet to reach out the the victims In fact I wish he had half as much concern for the rest of Americans including Muslims that he does defending Judge Pirro who promoted antiMuslim conspiracies that are found in the same ideological swamp shared by these white supremacists around the world I wish he would attack the number one domestic terror threat in America according to the FBI which are white supremacists the number one source of domestic terror plots in the past ten years with as much gusto and passion that he attacked John McCain the press SNL and Robert Mueller But he has not done that and he hasnt done it throughout his presidency And Ill say something bold here its because I think Chris Donald Trump is racist Hes not racially charged or racially motivated or has racial flareups He has promoted and mainstreamed a white supremacist conspiracy theory to win the midterm elections which is that George Soros was funding the caravan  the invasion The same language used by the way by the Australian terrorists who killed 50 people last week UmYES PLEASE Hayes brought up the Mick Mulvaney apology tour you know the one where the Acting Chief of Staff went to all the cable news shows and had to answer the question Hey is your boss a white supremacist He sure seems awful white supremacisty Sidenote  I dont think Mulvaney has what it takes By the third or so he was suuuper tired of answering that questionHow many times do I have to deny this Ali had an epic takedown of that insulting display as well ALI Its 2019 You cant gaslight me Because I remember the president saying I think Islam hates us I remember the president asking for a slipping into the Trump voice total and complete ban on Muslims until we can figure out what the hell is going on I remember the president saying he saw a tape on television of Muslims celebrating the 911 terror attacks I doubledare you President Trump Im calling you out You say that you saw the tape of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey the 911 terror attacks Show me the tape So this is a president whos antiMuslim Again I want to say this Chris He mainstreamed a white supremacist talking point in October The Jews led by George Soros a JewishHungarian American funding the caravan of rapists criminals Muslims and Mexicans That is exactly the number one conspiracy theory of white supremacists that the rest of us are being used by the Jews to weaken the white race which was used by the shooter who killed 50 people last week You got to call him out and youve also got to call out the Republican leaders who also mainstreamed it That includes Kevin McCarthy Call them all out and ask them Do you stand by President Trumps views of that white supremacist conspiracy theory Reporters need to ask until they answer You hear that reporters Call racism and antiSemitism what it is when it happens even if it comes out of the mouths of powerful people ESPECIALLY when it comes out of the mouths of our leaders And dont stop asking about it until they answer

343,Crooks and Liars,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/03/after-100-years-mussolinis-fascist-party,nRichard Gunderman Indiana University One hundred years ago in March 1919 Benito Mussolini created the fascist party in Italy   For more than two decades when he came to be known as Il Duce or the leader Mussolini wielded broad powers At the end of World War II he was shot by a firing squad for his crimes His body was publicly hung upside down  In my political philosophy course at Indiana University my students and I study Mussolinis rise to power and his dishonorable end His life offers deep cautionary insights for contemporary politics  Mussolini was born in the small Italian town of Predappio in 1883 After qualifying as a teacher he joined the socialists who believed in public ownership of property He was arrested and jailed by the government for promoting strikes His advocacy in support of World War I brought him into conflict with the socialist party which expelled him  In response he founded a new political movement Fascism from the Italian word for bundle which symbolized government authority in ancient Rome Wounded while serving in the Italian military he was discharged and began working as a journalist Thereafter Mussolini received funding from the British secret service to publish prowar propaganda in his newspaper He developed the idea of vital space calling on Italy to reclaim from other Mediterranean nations much of the land that once belonged to the Roman Empire In 1919 he announced that the fascist movement was becoming a political party As the leader of fascism Mussolini pushed for the growth of the Italian population He believed a larger population was necessary for the nation to function as a worldclass military power  He also regarded Africans and Asians as inherently inferior Again and again he called on white Italian women to produce more children  Mussolinis fascists formed squads of war veterans known as Black Shirts who would clash with the members of other political parties particularly communists and socialists  The government harbored deep fears of a communist revolution and rarely interfered giving Mussolinis forces relatively free rein  In 1922 tens of thousands of Black Shirts gathered in Rome to demand political change The liberal government sought to declare martial law but the king of Italy Victor Emmanuel III fearing civil war instead asked Mussolini to form a new government While the Fascists constituted only a small percentage of Prime Minister Mussolinis original government he pressured the legislature to grant him dictatorial powers over what citizens could do and not do seeking to meld the state with the Fascist party  By 1924 his national alliance won nearly twothirds of the vote A socialist deputy who decried ballot irregularities was murdered   Mussolini quickly built a cult of personality around himself  Those who sought to oppose him were held in check by governmental and extragovernmental means including intimidation Multiple assassination attempts against him were unsuccessful Mussolini selected the editors of news outlets required all teachers to take an oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime and invested large sums of money in projects designed to enhance his own standing domestically and around the world In The Doctrine of Fascism published in 1932 Mussolini and a fellow Fascist described the state as all embracing declaring that outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist As seeds of World War II began to germinate in the 1930s Mussolini believed that Britain and France were doomed by low birth rates and the relatively high age of their populations and he determined that Italy should ally itself with rapidly growing Germany  When the Germans under Hitler easily invaded Poland in 1939 Mussolini concluded that Germany would quickly prevail and entered the war on its side Yet Italy was a much weaker war power than Germany and by 1943 a series of defeats had left the Italian army in desperate shape Italys factories were idled and food shortages were the rule The people turned against Il Duce Soon US and Allied forces were bombing Rome When Allied troops swept into Italy in 1945 Mussolini was apprehended by communists and executed As outlined by historian Martin Gilbert the Italian and German experiments with fascism offer urgent lessons for our own day  First the strongest protection against oneman rule is deep and widespread respect for democracy Mussolini undermined free speech and freedom of the press He weakened the legislative and judicial branches of government He tried to control what people saw heard and read A second lesson from fascism is to prevent the manufacture of emergencies  By creating a widespread sense that times were desperate Mussolini like Hitler was able to suppress democratic institutions and tyrannize the population   Another lesson is the danger of racism  In arguing that whites are superior to Africans and Asians Mussolini laid the groundwork for exploitation oppression and even extermination  Ironically it is quite possible that had Italys military and economy prospered during the 1940s Mussolini would not have fallen People all over the world need to remember that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance  Fascism and the hatred it breeds can undermine goodness and inflame evil  Democratic convictions that required centuries to build up can be demolished within months  This cautionary tale of Mussolinis rise to power serves as an enduring reminder of the fragility of freedom Richard

350,Daily Beast,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hold-cardinal-pells-second-secret-sex-abuse-trial-called-off?ref=wrap,SEARCH One jury found the Vaticans No 3 prelate guilty of sexually abusing boys but prosecutors agreed to scrap a second trial on different charges CorrespondentAtLarge Editor at Large Two months after Cardinal George Pell was convicted of sexually abusing boys a judge has decided the Vaticans third most powerful official will not face a second trial on similar charges in his home country of Australia The decision means that a suppression order that kept the proceedings shrouded in secrecy has been lifted and Pell 77 will now be sentenced in the original case Reporters who have attended the proceedings without being able to report them now say the court heard testimony that Pell forced one choir boy to perform oral sex on him after mass and that he masturbated in front the other victim while he groped and fondled him  One of the two victims died of a drug overdose several years ago which prompted the other victim who testified in court against the cardinal to come forward   Cardinal Pell will be remanded in custody on Wednesday to await sentencing He faces up to 50 years in prison  The development comes as Pope Francis faces global criticism for his mishandling of clerical sexual abuse including his reluctance to declare zero tolerance for predators and their enablers at a landmark summit in Rome this month  The Vatican spokesman said on Tuesday that it would withhold final judgement until Pell exhausted his appeals calling the conviction  painfulnews that we are well aware has shocked many people not only in Australia Cardinal Pell has reiterated his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree Waiting for final judgement we join the Australian bishops in praying for all the victims of abuse the statement reads Waiting for the definitive verification of the facts Cardinal Pell is forbidden as a precautionary measure the public exercise of the ministry and as a rule contact in any way or form with minors Pell head of the Vaticans Secretariat for Economic Affairs is the highestranking prelate to face sexual abuse allegations dating back decades  In June as his trial was about to get underway in Melbourne a judge barred all press coverage in Australia at the request of prosecutors who said publicity could prejudice the jurors In the first caseknown as the Cathedral Trial because of where the abuse allegedly happenedPell was accused of sexually abusing two choir boys in the 1990s He was found guilty of one count of penetrating a child under 16 and four counts of indecent acts with a child under 16  A mistrial was declared in October due to a hung jury that reportedly was leaning 102 in favor of the cardinal But in December he was found guilty of five criminal counts on retrial Like many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon  on my life the surviving victim said in a statement issued through his lawyer Vivian Waller on Tuesday At  some point we realize that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust The Daily Beast was the first to report the news of Pells conviction by geoblocking the story from Australian audiences in accordance with the suppression order Pell faced additional charges in a second case known as the Swimmers Trial because the alleged offenses took place in a swimming pool and clubhouse  The trial was set to begin after the court sentenced Pell in the Cathedral case but has been abandoned due to lack of admissible evidence A Vatican source close to Pells defense team told The Daily Beast that the prosecution argued that they had lost a key witness which led them to agree that the trial should be scuttled  Pell who has been free on bail has maintained his innocence throughout and is said to be appealing his conviction Despite promises made by Pope Francis to hold prelates on every level accountable for their part in abuse Pell has not yet been sanctioned or defrocked He wasnt even removed as head of the Vatican Secretariat of the Economy during his trial and merely remained on leave of absence from the No 3 xa0post in the Roman Curia However in December after the conviction he was removed from the socalled C9 committee of nine papal advisers The pope has used strong language to condemn abusescalling them tools of Satan during his closing remarks at the summit on Sundaybut has been criticized for not backing up his words with action When asked about Pell on the sidelines of the weekend summit Australian Archbishop Mark Coleridge told The Daily Beast he would not comment due to the Australian gag order On Tuesday he expressed shock to reporters in the lobby of his the residence where he is staying in Rome The same legal system that delivered the verdict will consider the  appeal that the cardinals legal team has lodged Coledridge said Our hope at all times is that through this process justice will be served In the meantime we pray for all those who have been abused and  their loved ones and we commit ourselves anew to doing everything  possible to ensure that the Church is a safe place for all especially  the young and the vulnerable Coleridge was a central figure in the summit delivering the homily during the closing mass on Sunday As the president of the Australian Bishops Conference he is the authoritative figure responsible for Pells future in the church  He will have to make a recommendation to Francis and provide the Vatican Tribunal with evidence from his home country It is understood that he and the pope did discuss Pell privately during the summit  We have shown too little mercy and therefore we will receive the same because the measure we give will be the measure we receive in return Coleridge said during his homily We will not go unpunished Francis told reporters on board the papal plane on the return from World Youth Day in Poland in 2016 that he would not judge Pell until the judicial process is over and he refused to comment on the case after news of Pells conviction surfaced  Survivors of clerical sex abuse have called for the removal of Pells title of cardinal and for his laicization because as a convicted sexual predator he should no longer be a representative of the Catholic church or be allowed to continue in ministry Former US Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was forced to resign last summer and was laicized in February after allegations that he sexually abused a 16yearold boy in a confessional in New York more than 30 years ago  The gag order in the case frustrated abuse victims and their advocates who were keenly interested in the outcome Suppression of information is a tool of the powerful Tim Lennon president of the Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests SNAP told The Daily Beast Suppression of information must not be a means for an accused criminal to avoid justice for other crimes Steven Spaner Australia coordinator for SNAP told The Daily Beast he was joyous at the news of Pells conviction which he said would be welcomed by survivors worldwide The fact that Pell was convicted in the first trial is an amazing accomplishment He may be the winner in the contest for the highestranking prelate to go to jail he said Victims will see that justice is at long last coming to them The survivors have always wanted their day in court and in Australia they finally had their day in court  CorrespondentAtLarge Editor at Large Got a tip Send it to The Daily

352,Daily Beast,https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-house-democrats-can-finally-nail-trump,SEARCH The scope of the power of inquiry the Supreme Court wrote is as penetrating and farreaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution President Trump may complain on Twitter or Fox News that congressional investigations are a partisan witch hunt presidential harassment and a disgrace but few judges will want to hear it Of course House Democrats have the legal power to obtain President Trumps tax returns And the full unredacted Mueller report And records of Trumps financial relations with Deutsche Bank and other lenders And much more  House Democrats need not ask meekly for information about Trumps finances and the Mueller report and accept whatever Trump voluntarily provides The power of the House and of the Senate to compel the disclosure of documents and testimony to inform the exercise of their constitutional powers is very very wellestablished The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process That power is broad the Supreme Court said in Barenblatt v United States It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes  The power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse or whether to appropriate the Supreme Court said in Watkins v United States The scope of the power of inquiry in short is as penetrating and farreaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution Citizens are required to comply with congressional subpoenas to testify fully with respect to matters within the province of proper investigation just as they are required to comply with judicial subpoenas Trump and his political allies argue that Congress has no power to prosecute crimes and matters under criminal investigation are none of House Democrats business House Democrats have other obviously proper reasons to investigate Trumps financial interests and the Mueller Report however  Congresss investigative powers are strongest when Congress seeks to expose corruption or mismanagement in the federal government even if the conduct under investigation is the subject of other active legal proceedings There is ample basis to suspect that Trump has used the powers of the presidency to enrich himself  Congress can also investigate corruption and other wrongdoing in the private sector in surveys of defects in our social economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them the Supreme Court said in Watkins and Congress frequently has The Senate conducted extensive hearings in the 50s and 60s into organized crime and union corruption Most Americans now just remember those hearings from the Godfather movies but the hearings resulted in significant legislation In 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO to close loopholes that made criminal prosecution of crime bosses difficult and to allow private lawsuits by anyone harmed by criminal organizations In 1974 Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA partly to protect pension plans from the sticky fingers of organized crime which controlled many union pension plans at the time  House Democrats need not have particular legislation in mind to investigate Trumps finances or the Mueller Report It is not at all difficult to imagine legislation that Congress might consider to remedy defects in our social economic or political system that the investigations might reveal  Congress could enact legislation to require more financial disclosure by presidential candidates rather than rely on the postWatergate tradition that presidents and presidential candidates voluntarily making their tax returns public Trump denied during the 2016 campaign that he had any financial interests in Russia while his business was in advanced negotiations for an ambitious project in Moscowa building that would reportedly have been the tallest in Europe The project would have been enormously profitable to Trump As a candidate Trump softened the Republican Party platforms support for Ukraine in that nations conflict with Russia and spoke favorably of Russian leader Vladimir Putin a figure not widely admired in American politics Many voters would like to have known in 2016 of Trumps negotiations with the Putin government for the proposed project in Moscow Congress might enact more specific prohibitions or enforcement mechanisms for the Constitutions anticorruption provisions the emoluments clauses to prevent any potential for selfdealing by the President and other government officials Conflicts of interest rules are meant to protect even honest politicians from the subtle tug of selfinterest a tug that Trump shows no desire to resist Trumps opulent hotel in downtown Washington has become the home away from home for officials from the worlds most repugnant regimes despite the ready availability of comparable accommodations nearby at a fraction of the cost Trump has been very delicate in his criticism of many of those regimes even in the face of barbaric conduct Congress might close tax loopholes or increase appropriations for tax enforcement It might revisit the independent counsel law to toughen the protection of criminal investigations from political interference  Congress might do all of that and more or nothing at all but information about Trumps finances and the full Mueller Report would inform those decisions Trump and his political allies promise to fight congressional investigations tooth and nail and say that their legal challenges will block any disclosures until well after the 2020 election Trump argues that any supposed legislative purpose is a pretext and House Democrats just want to inflict political damage  The courts recognize a presumption of the validity of government proceedings so that When a committee of Congress is engaged in a legitimate legislative inquiry and the questions propounded are relevant and material to the inquiry the courts will not question the motives of the questioner  In other words if Congress has a valid legislative purpose for an investigation but also has political motives then so what When does Congress not have political motives Trumps pretext argument is legally flimsy and maybe frivolous Its all hes got,-2

355,Daily Beast,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-brings-a-gun-to-a-democratic-primary-knife-fight,SEARCH The senators overreaction over a mere web video makes some Democrats concerned that he cant handle the heat that comes with being the frontrunner Political Reporter In seeking the 2020 nomination for the presidency Sen Bernie Sanders IVT had made overtures that hed operate more firmly within the Democratic Party as the party adopted procedural reforms to accommodate his concerns  The rapprochement was always delicate And this week it hit a major snag as the senators presidential campaign opened fire at one of the Democratic Partys leading think tanks over a video that its editorially independent news site posted on Sanders personal wealth  That video from ThinkProgress and the senators response in which he accused the Center for American Progress of bias against liberal candidates and veneration for corporate interests exposed the lingering animus between the Sanders and the Democratic Partys actual institutions  It also raised alarm and questions as to whether Sanders was running to lead the party or to fundamentally change it  If you always want to be an aggrieved factional candidate then you do what they did here said a Democratic operative who is a fan of Sanders It has nothing to do with the electoral context of Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada or South Carolina Lets go fight that battle Voters dont care about CAP The root of the latest blow up was a video produced by ThinkProgress noting that Sanders had stopped maligning millionairesleaving his criticism for billionaireswhen he became one himself The news site is part of the CAP umbrella which gave the video the veneer of a sanctioned attack But it also claims editorial independence from the think tank though the degree of that independence is difficult to define  Sanders campaign was initially uncertain of how it should respond to the post But a day after it had been upand shared gleefully by Republican operativesthey chose to push back in a way that Democrats said redefined disproportionality  Over the weekend Sanders campaign sent a letter to the board of CAP and CAP Action Fund saying that the counterproductive negative campaigning needs to stop The letter referenced content written about Sanders and two close colleagues who are also in the 2020 race Senators Elizabeth Warren DMA and Cory Booker DNJ It also explicitly called out CAP president Neera Tanden an ally of Hillary Clinton who has been critical of Sanders in the past but has attempted to mend bridges  Among some Democrats there was a sense of bewilderment that the Sanders campaign had goneas one operative put itnuclear over a mere web video One Democratic consultant sympathetic to Sanders described the video as being like a gnat buzzing around your ear one which should not have distracted from the candidates Midwest tour  It also raised questions as to whether the senator was ready for the scrutiny that would come from being a frontrunning candidate after having run as an insurgent against an ideal foil Hillary Clinton in 2016  When youre leading in the polls of president of your party you should expect investigative stories to hit at least once a week and to be attacked by your opponents every day said Ben Labolt who served as press secretary to Barack Obama during the 2012 campaign An attack on something like ThinkProgress is the sign of a supernarrowminded campaign that isnt actually thinking of how the election will be won They have chosen

personal questions that he deems irrelevant to the set of beliefs he has espoused for decades And his attack on CAP effectively set a benchmark for the type of coverage that the his team would countenance and reinforced his brand as someone outside of typical party structures It also undermined any notion that he was a political pushovera suggestion that lingered for some after he muted some of his attacks on Clinton in 2016  It didnt hurt matters that some prominent though nonestablishment Democratic figures offered Sanders their support Tom Steyer the liberal billionaire donor and party activist who also serves on the board of directors for CAP issued a statement on his own saying he would use his voice on the Center for American Progress Board of Directors to discourage any such attacks on any candidate seeking the Democratic nomination in the future Those close to Steyer told The Daily Beast that he released the statement without consulting with others at the organization and that it by no means suggested he was endorsing Sanders Another CAP board member xa0Stacey Abrams declined to comment But a spokesperson for the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia directed The Daily Beast to a conciliatory statement Tanden issued on Monday afternoon saying the video had been overly harsh and did not reflect our approach to a constructive debate of the issues That for now seems to have quieted the skirmish with Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir saying that the campaign looked forward to working in a more productive manner with CAP

for the raid that seized a trove of intel just before the TrumpKim summit CIA North Korean exiles Rogue South Korean spooks Or all of the above SEOULThe 10 men in dark suits who raided the North Korean embassy in Madrid last month had one goal in mind it would seem to overthrow the regime of Kim Jong Un Although the scene of the Feb 22 crime in Spain was many thousands of miles from the DMZ analysts view the 10 involved as the cutting edge of a North Korean dissident group thats now named Jayu Joseon Free North Korea It allegedly has the backing of some wealthy Koreans and foreigners as well as ties inside the Northapparently the first organization to have set up an operational challenge to the leadership in Pyongyang The immediate purpose of the breakin was to seize computers and cellphones on which intelligence analysts could find topsecret message traffic to the former North Korean ambassador to Spain Kim Hyok Chol  He was expelled by Madrid in September 2017 after the United Nations imposed new sanctions on the North for its nuclear and missile tests But at the time of the raid last month he had a much more sensitive position Pyongyangs envoy to the nuclear talks with Washington and Seoul  The group busted into the embassy just five days before the summit in Hanoi between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un which would have made any intelligence it picked up usefulbut has also been cited by analysts as a reason it was not sanctioned by the Americans The timing would seem to be too provocative and the risk of scuttling the summit too high In any event for a multitude of reasons anticipated long before the Madrid incident the Hanoi summit was a failure Initial reports in Spain after the breakin did not mention Jayu Joseon formerly named Cheollima Civil Defense but did mention suspicions among unnamed Spanish authorities that two of the men who took part had unspecified connections to the US Central Intelligence Agency Subsequent reports in The Washington Post and elsewhere have suggested Jayu Joseon operates entirely on its own But the very long record of exileunderground movements around the world suggests they almost always have at least some support from foreign powers and may also receive direction from them Nicaraguas Contras built up by the Reagan administration in the 1980s and Irans Mujahedin e Khalq backed by Iraqs Saddam Hussein until his downfall would be two examples Yet another sign of the extreme sensitivity of the Madrid operation is that Spanish authorities have not released any information on their investigation aside from the basic facts that the 10 men entered the embassy beat up and tied eight people inside and remained there for several hours Jayu Joseon has yet to comment on the Madrid raid Indeed it might not have been publicized at all had a police vehicle not shown up at the embassy after a woman freed herself and appeared at a window shouting for help  When a police officer knocked on the door a man opened it up and said there was no problem The police respecting the embassys diplomatic status did not attempt to enter and see for themselves Finally the 10 fled in two luxury vehicles that sped through the opened gates of the embassy drive The cars veered crazily through traffic before they were abandoned and the men disappeared without a traceat least as far as public information is concerned  Compounding the mystery is the fact that North Koreans are not commenting on an episode that had to have embarrassed them by revealing the weakness of their own security and the loss of potentially valuable information known only at the highest levels Even when Spanish police first leaked word that two of the 10 had links to the CIA it was evident Madrid authorities knew a lot more Surely they would have searched and traced the vehicles to their owners and they would have been expected to track down at least some of the 10 rather than let all escape so cleanly in broad daylight leaving no clues as to who they were or who was behind them In that respect the operation is reminiscent of the sloppy CIA kidnapping of a jihadi off the street in Milan in February 2003 which eventually exposed the cooperation of local intelligence services as well Thats why many believe the CIA did that said Kim Taewoo That explains the silence of the the Spanish government Jayu Joseon or Cheollima did not appear out of nowhere It previously promoted Kim Jong Nam Kim Jong Uns rather more mellow funloving and quite talkative older halfbrother to overthrow and replace him  Kim Jong Nam was murdered in February 2017 when VX nerve agent which is part of North Koreas chembio warfare arsenal was smeared on his face at Kuala Lumpurs airport  After the murder presumed to have been orchestrated by Kim Jong Uns agents Jayu Joseon took credit for spiriting Kim Jong Nams son Kim Han Sol along with his mother and sister out of their home in Macao and taking them to a foreign country widely thought to be Finland since Han Sol broadcast a sorrowful message on Finnish TV The Madrid 10 are assumed to have transferred the computers and mobile phones to a foreign intelligence agency An auction to the highest bidder would not be unprecedented in such matters but most of the suspicion is focused on the CIA which if it could access the encrypted material in time could have found information potentially useful for the Hanoi summit and afterward They can see the North Korean strategy and goals said Kim Taewoo former director of the Korea Institute of National Unification here Money for that possible treasure trove of information would have been only one motive for the raid Patriotism and power are the core incentives for the group said to be spearheaded by defectors from North Korea and what appear to be foreigners with a stake in their activities  One strong sign of foreign involvement says Kim Taewoo is that Koreanlanguage statements on their website are written awkwardly reflecting authorship by one whose Korean is less than perfect Adding to the suspected CIA connection are reports that the late Kim Jong Nam before he left his hotel in Kuala Lumpur for the airport had been seen talking to an American Then after he was murdered by the two women who smeared the VX agent on his face 124000 in 100 bills reportedly was found in his bag leading to speculation that he had been paid off for services to the Americans or to promote Jayu Joseon or both Suspicions that Kim Jong Nam might have wanted to seize power no doubt spurred Kim Jong Un to want to get him out of the way  Two young women one from Indonesia the other from Vietnam actually smeared the poison on on Kim Jong Nams face in the crowded airport  but four North Koreans were caught on camera watching the whole episode They had convinced the women this was a harmless prank for which they paid them a small sum The four listed as wanted by Malaysian police quickly checked onto flights out of the country The Indonesian was freed by the court last week after prosecutors dropped the case against her but the Vietnamese woman has been ordered to stand trial Early the morning of the court hearings someone spraypainted on the walls of the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur in Korean Hangul script  Free North Korea Jayu Joseon and Down with Kim Jong Un  North Korea sends important messages to every embassy every month or so said Ken Eom who defected to South Korea 10 years ago But Jayu Joseon is believed to have selected the North Korean embassy in Spain rather than the much larger North Korean embassy in Stockholm Sweden the center of North Korean operations in Europe for two reasons First the installation in Madrid without the ambassador there was not so tightly guarded as other embassies And second Kim Hyok Chol while he was there would have been privy to the highest level of messages Whatever the planning the raid exposes what is evidently the first sign of armed opposition by a North Korean dissident group against Kim Jong Un and his oppressive regime We can be 999 percent sure that Cheollima Jayu Joseon carried out the raid says Lee Sungyoon professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University They had all the incentive As noted Ambassador Kim Hyok Chol after his expulsion emerged as the Norths chief negotiator in the very difficult presummit dialogue with the US envoy on North Korea Stephen Biegun and some of the message traffic since his departure from Spain was presumed to concern those talks The messages may have kept on coming for some time through the embassy in Spain even though he would see them elsewhere Or at least that may have been the assumption of the Madrid 10 The organization appears to have gone quiet after the Kim Jong Nam incident two years ago with the Madrid incident marking a spectacular comeback It should be noted that South Korean President Moon Jaein was elected in May 2017 and almost certainly would not tolerate covert action against North Korea by South Koreas National Intelligence Service NIS The NIS under Moon would definitely not be involved said David Straub former senior diplomat at the US embassy in Seoul The Moon administrations policy involves appeasement of Pyongyang this action is the opposite of that Many NIS operatives reportedly have been laid off under Moon however and just as retired South Korean military officers are often quite critical of what they see as the governments current soft line against North Korea so outofwork NIS people speak derisively of the trend to ignore or silence them Malcontents have reason to criticize the governments policies So many have been ousted theyre very upset says Kim Taewooxa0But might a few want to consider supporting an armed movement against the North Theoretically its possible but there is no evidence  For the record both the US and South Korea officially profess complete ignorance of the whole affair beyond what theyve seen in the media I have nothing to share at this time said a US embassy spokesman here We have nothing to confirm echoed a voice at the South Korean foreign ministry Jayu Joseon on its website in correct English gives the cruelty of the North Korean regime as the reason it cannot identify its members much less where they are Do not forget how merciless the regime is says the message on the site Identification of one person may reveal the identity of another member The website says compatriots and relatives have lost their lives in the hands of the regime and those who are imprisoned will be put to death if it is revealed that they have dissenters in their families Jayu Joseon established credibility by acting quickly and getting Kim Han Sol the son of Kim Jong Nam to safety within days of his fathers gruesome assassination on Feb 13 2017 said Lee Sungyoon An aura of mystery was created said Lee Mystique and aura create expectations of more dazzling feats to come But for the next two years the group was silent Then the raid on the DPRK Embassy in Madrid came just five days shy of the TrumpKim Jong Un summit in Hanoi Lee is among those who believe the Cheollima organization short of funds may have hoped to use these CIA connections to unload all these computers and phones for a fat fee Approaching the US government with the assets retrieved in Madrid would possibly secure the group some protection and even support behind the scenes he said Lee questions however whether the CIA would have planned the operation reasoning For the CIA to commit such a brazen actand almost get caught in the middle of itand undermine Trumps leverage would have been tantamount to treason Analysts say Jayu Joseon is angling for support inside North Korea as well despite the obvious dangers of exposure and execution of anyone caught by Kim Jong Uns security apparatus Senior defectors say these guys have to have contacts said Kim Sungbak Hanyang University expert on North Korea They try to establish themselves as the legal government Chances of success are not good Its hard to imagine any opposition group outside North Korea having ties and support inside the DPRK said a retired US official who asked that his name not be used The risks are just too high and the internal security in the North is just too tight and pervasive Be that as it may the shadowy figures behind the participants in the raid promise a long struggle Please do not forget the kind of ruthless regime we are up against says a message on the website They have no respect for international norms The struggle we are engaged in with the incumbent regime is not a political race between equals but a small revolutionary group fighting and resisting a totalitarian regime that maintains concentration camps keeps its people enslaved and regularly kills its opponents and their families The inference was clear They intend to be heard from again The rescue of Kim Jong Nams son and the raid in Madrid are not likely to be the end of the story In Kuala Lumpur the writing was on the wall  Itxu Díaz in Madrid also contributed

tutor confesses I would say about 50 percent were entirely rewritten Reporter Last week the sting operation dubbed Operation Varsity Blues exposed a long list of wellheeled and wellknown parents who rigged the collegeadmissions process in part by paying proctors and ringers to take or correct tests for their kids Not long after news of the scheme broke critics rushed to point out that celebrity parents like Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman didnt need to break the law to game the system  For the ultrarich big contributions might get their name on a science building and their offspring a spot at a toptier schoolan option California Gov Gavin Newsom recently called legal bribery Even the moderately wealthy can grease the admissions process with extensive SAT tutoring or more problematically college application essay editing In the admissions process theres a high premium on the personal statement a 500word essay submitted through the Common Application about some foible or lesson which aims to give readers a better sense of the student than say a standardized test score More than one university and advising blog rank the essay among the most important aspects of the process one consultant writing in The New York Times described it as the purest part of the application  But while test scores are completed by the student alonebarring bribed proctors that isany number of people can alter an essay before submission opening it up to exploitation and lessthanpure tactics at the hands of helicopter parents or expensive collegeprep counselors who cater to the 1 percent In interviews with The Daily Beast eight college application tutors shed light on the economy of editing altering and at times outright rewriting personal statements The essay editors who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity since many still work in their field painted the portrait of an industry rife with ethical hazards where the line between helping and cheating can become difficult to draw  The employees who spoke to The Daily Beast often worked for companies with similar approaches to essay writing For most tutors would Skype with students early on in the application process to brainstorm ideas I would say there were a lot of instances of hammering kids with potential ideas one tutor said Like Thats a terrible idea for an essay why dont you try this instead Then the student would write a draft and bounce back edits with their tutor who would grade it according to a standardized rubric which included categories like spelling sentence structure style or whether it was bullshitfree Most made between 30 and 100 per hour or around 1000 for helping a student through the entire application process at times working on as many as 18 essays at a time for various schools Two tutors who worked for the same company said they got a bonus if clients were accepted at their target universities  One consultant a 22yearold Harvard graduate told The Daily Beast that during his senior year in college he began working as an essay editor for a company that hires Ivy Leaguers to tutor applicants on a range of subjects When he took the job in September 2017 the company was still young and fairly informal Managers would send him essays via email and the tutor would revise and return them with anywhere between a 24hour and twoweek turnaround But from the beginning the consultant explained his managers were pretty explicit that the job entailed less editing than rewriting  When its done it needs to be good enough for the student to go to that school whether that means lying making things up on behalf of the student or basically just changing anything such that it would be acceptable he told The Daily Beast Ive edited anywhere from 200 to 225 essays So probably like 150 students total I would say about 50 percent were entirely rewritten In one particularly egregious instance the tutor said a student submitted an essay on hiphop which named his three or four favorite rappers but lacked a clear narrative The tutor said he rewrote the essay to tell the story of the student moving to America struggling to connect with an American stepfamily but eventually finding a connection through rap I rewrote the essay such that it said you know he found that through his stepbrother he could connect through rap music and having a stepbrother teach him about rap music and I talked about this lovingrelation thing I dont know if that was true He just said he liked rap music  Over time the tutor said his company shifted its work model Instead of sending him random anonymous essays the managers began to assign him students to oversee during the entire college application cycle They thought it looked better the tutor said So if I get some student Abby Whatever I would write all 18 of her essays so that it would look like it was all one voice I had this past year 40 students in the fall and I wrote all their essays for the Common App and everything else Not every consultant was as explicit about the editing worlds moral ambiguities One administrator emphasized that his companys policies were firmly anticheating He conceded however that the rules were not always followed Bottom line is It takes more time for an employee to sit with a student and help them figure things out for themselves than it does to just do it We had problems in the past with people cutting corners Weve also had problems in the past with students asking for corners to be cut Another consultant who worked for the same company and later became the assistant director of US operations told The Daily Beast that while rewriting was not overtly encouraged it was also not strictly prohibited  The precise terms were I was getting paid a lump sum in exchange for helping this student with this Common App essay and supplement essays at a couple universities I was given a rubric of qualities for the essay and I was told that the essay had to score a certain point at that rubric he said It was never clear that anything legal was in our way we were just told to make essayswe were told and we told tutorsto make the essays meet a certain quality standard and you know we didnt ask too many questions about who wrote what Many of the tutors told The Daily Beast that their clients were often international students seeking advice on how to break into the American university system Some of the foreign students four of the eight tutors told The Daily Beast ranged in their English ability and required significant rewriting One consultant a freelancer who stumbled into tutoring in the fall of 2017 after a classmate needed someone to take over his clients recounted the story of a female applicant with littletono English skills  Her parents had me come in and look at all her college essays The shape they were brought to me in was essentially unreadable I mean there were the bare workings of a narrative hereeven the grasp on English is tenuous he said I think that you know being able to read and write in English would be kind of a prerequisite for an American university But these parents really dont care about that at all Theyre going to pay whoever to make the essays look like whatever to get their kids into school The tutor continued to advise this client doing numerous numerous edits on this girls essay until she was later accepted at Columbia University But not long after she matriculated the tutor said she reached back out to him for help with her English courses She doesnt know how to write essays and shes struggling in class he told The Daily Beast I do the help that I can but I say to the parents You know you did not prepare her for this You put her in this position Because obviously the skills necessary to be at Columbiashe doesnt have those skills The Daily Beast reached out to numerous college planning and tutoring programs and the National Association for College Admissions Counseling but none responded to requests to discuss their policies on editing versus rewriting The American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers also declined comment and top universities such as Harvard Yale Princeton the University of Pennsylvania Cornell Dartmouth and Brown did not respond or declined comment on how they guard against essays being written by counselors or tutors Stanford said in a statement that they have no specific policy with regard to the essay portion of the application  A spokesperson for Common Application the notforprofit organization that oversees most college essay submissions wrote that all students must sign a waiver before submitting their application affirming that it is completely their own work factually true and honestly presented In the Operation Varsity Blues case the cheating was stunningly brazen One of the proctors socalled test whiz Mark Riddell a Harvard grad who allegedly took hundreds of thousands in bribes actually bubbled in kids answers on standardized test sheets according to prosecutors But the world of college essay editing is more subtle  Every good piece of writing needs an editorsomeone to point out redundancy confusing sentences cliches or even just where things get boringand two of the tutors who spoke to The Daily Beast said that was the kind of editing that made up most of their work Oftentimes the job is as simple as what do you mean by this or be more specific one tutor said But for others it wasnt always clear where editing became cheating or just how many revisions they could make before they were in their own way just bubbling in the answers When youre working on a piece of writing theres not really a motive to it other than to like it and to get other people to like it But with this theres an agenda one of the more cynical tutors explained And the agenda is megetting me into this school I think that kind of changes the extent of what people want out of an editor I

ISISlinked channels and chat groups called for Muslims to give a worthy reply to travelers from the land of Australia  Responding to Tarrants livestreamed video of the attack which showed his rifles covered in white supremacists slogans ISIS supporters online disseminated an image of a rifle with Arabic text threatening revenge  Like the aftermath of other tragedies social media has played a critical role in capitalizing on the Christchurch attack On an ISISlinked Telegram chat group user alAseef alBaghdadi demanded that fellow ISIS supporters logon to Facebook and Twitter and incite for shedding the blood of the worshippers of the Cross On March 18 three days after the Christchuch attack ISIS released a speech by its spokesman Abu alHassan alMuhajir in which he comments on the attacks among other topics Despite ISIS years of labeling nonsupporting Muslims as apostates Muhajirs speech seemed to temporarily disregard that history upon the victims sudden propagandic value The scenes of death in the two mosques are enough to wake the sleep and incite the supporters of the Caliphate who live there to take vengeance for their religion And its not just ISIS leeching off the tragedy A statement from Shabaab alMujahideen Movement spokesman Ali Mahmoud Rage a joint statement from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb AQIM and Jamaat Nusrat alIslam wal Muslimeen JNIM and other messages by al Qaeda entities condemned Donald Trump as leading the mountain of Western hatred against Islam However their messages also argue a point unsurprisingly similar to that of white nationalists that the Christchurch attack was the result of an inevitable hostility between Muslims and Christians in the West  The al Qaeda affiliates also called for revenge with the joint AQIMJNIM statement demanding for lone wolves to target the heads of the Crusader far right This growing mountain of responses considered dont be surprised when the Christchurch attack remains a staple of jihadi propaganda a decade from now These parallel swells of incitements by both jihadists and farright extremists in some ways strip both movements of their ideological veils leaving behind a much barer look at extremism itself For these violent groups and communities such tragedies are mutually beneficial events That said an attack like that in Christchurch should not be seen simply a tragedy in and of itself it is a link in a longer branching chain of attacks From jihadists attacks on Charlie Hebdo in France and Pulse nightclub in Orlando to white nationalists attacks on the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City and now in Christchurcheach of these events adds more fuel to extremists delusions of Crusades and ethnic invasions They feed into their poisonous narratives that praying to ones God whichever one it may be is an act of war xa0 Its not incorrect to attribute Tarrants alleged attack on a toxic and divisive political climate but it does miss just how important the Internet itself is in allowing violent extremist ideology to thrive Farright movements and ISIS began surging around the same time in recent years both driven by the unfettered power of social media The planning and recruitment that once required secret meetings and burned letters now takes place uninterrupted right out in the open  Worsening the problem is a prevalent delusion that warning signs from people like Tarrant are somehow more elusive than those of the jihadists who are so frequently monitored and thwarted The Internet and especially social media is among the most critical elements giving life to these communities And when comparing the way jihadist online spaces are handled compared to white supremacists its not even close hiding behind images of their countries flags and pseudopatriotic slogans white supremacists are too often left unchecked Tarrant streamed his alleged attack online not just to shock us but because he knew he would have an audience of supporters who are still producing glorifying propaganda from his barbaric broadcast  It took governments and the tech sector years to address ISIS recruitment boom on social media Today were seeing the same blunder when it comes to white supremacist communities Thus as we mourn for the victims of Christchurch and their families diminishing extremists capacity online should be just as much a preventative focus as any other social or legislative measures to come,0

368,Daily Caller,https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/27/peace-cross-supreme-court-case/,REUTERSLawrence Hurley The Supreme Court seemed poised Wednesday to protect a 40foot World War One memorial cross on public land in Bladensburg Maryland from a lawsuit that argues it violates the Constitution Though the bottomline outcome was never seriously in doubt the justices appeared divided and confused during Wednesdays argument as to why the monument  know colloquially as the Peace Cross  should pass constitutional muster The Courts jurisprudence concerning the establishment clause  that is religion in public life  is famously confused On one day in 2005 the high court said that a statue of the Ten Commandments near the Texas statehouse did not violate the Constitution but that a similar display in a Kentucky courthouse did Justice Neil Gorsuch colorfully derided the controlling precedents as a dogs breakfast during Wednesdays arguments The American Legion built the Peace Cross to honorxa0the World War One dead of Prince Georges County in 1925 Defending the monument before the Court the Legion suggested a new intelligible approach for establishment clause cases they said government should permit sectarian displays like the Peace Cross provided they do not proselytize or coerce onlookers into religious practice Current case lawxa0requires courts to ask whether a display endorses religion in appearance or in reality The Legions theory met a cool reception at the Court Wednesday even among the rightleaning justices sympathetic to their purpose Gorsuch said he did not see how their solution was meaningfully different from the current endorsement test It seems to me that you are taking us right back to the dogs breakfast youve warned us about Gorsuch said Chief Justice John Roberts sounded similar themes but acknowledged that each religious display case is unique making general rules and clear tests difficult in this area of law What you advertise is a pretty concise test but it degenerates pretty quickly the chief said elsewhere suggesting the current test might be the best judges can do A Maryland state parks commission which assumed control of the Peace Cross in 1961 separately defended the memorial on more narrow grounds The commission argued that the monument does not suggest explicitly Christian concepts Rather it recalls European battle cemeteries where crosses were typically used as headstones Whats more the Peace Cross has other features that dilute its religious content such as the seal of the Legion Justice Elena Kagan  who defended a cross memorial as solicitor general in the Obama administration  seemed to agree with that proposition noting the cross stood without objection for over 90 years There are other war memorials nearby Kagan said There are no religious words on the memorial Quite the opposite  all the words on the memorial are words about military valor and so forth So why in a case like that can we not say essentially that the religious content has been stripped off this monument But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seemed skeptical RELATED The Press Was Alarmed By Justice Thomass Latest Opinion Does the cross really have a dual meaning Ginsburg asked It is the preeminent symbol of Christianity A concrete cross commemorating servicemen killed in World War One the subject of a religious rights case now before the Supreme Court is seen in Bladensburg Maryland REUTERSLawrence Hurley Justice Stephen Breyer proposed a middle way suggesting that older memorials invoking sectarian themes should be protected though similar monuments should not be erected in the future History counts Breyer said But no more We are a different country now and there are more than 50 different religions A divided threejudge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals found that the memorial violates the Constitution over a dissent that feared the ruling would prompt the removal of crosses from Arlington National Cemetery which sits in the 4th Circuits jurisdiction The case arose in 2014 when three Maryland residents sued the parks commission with the support of the American Humanist Association AHA The plaintiffs say that the Peace Cross violates the First Amendments ban on religious favoritism The Legion intervened in the case given its historical connection to the monument The Legion and other veterans groups still host annual programs at the Peace Cross Speaking outside the Supreme Court after Wednesdays argument the Legions national judge advocate expressed regret that the justices needed to hear the case at all This memorial honors and remembers those 49 heroes that died for our freedom Bartlett said We feel terrible that we have to be here When we signed up to go into the service nobody asked what our religion was We went in and did our job just like those men Lets keep honoring them just like we need to honor all of our memorials he added Alec Schemmel contributed to this report Follow Kevin on

370,Daily Caller,https://dailycaller.com/2019/03/19/sandy-hook-gun-maker-lawsuit/,Toya Sarno JordanGetty Images The Connecticut Supreme Courts Thursday ruling allowing victims of the 2012 Sandy Hookxa0Elementary School massacre to sue gun manufacturer Bushmaster Firearms left Second Amendment groups bewildered Thexa043 decisionxa0found that the plaintiffs  the families of nine victims  can sue Bushmaster under state unfair trade practices law despite a federal statute that protects the gun industry from most lawsuits This is like suing Ford or General Motors because a car they sold was stolen and used to run over a pedestrian all because the car manufacturers advertised that their car had better acceleration and performance than other vehiclesxa0said the Second Amendment Foundations Alan Gottlieb This ruling strains logic if not common sense Gottlieb added The court dismissed the bulk of the lawsuits allegations but appears to have grasped at this single straw by deciding that the advertising is somehow at fault for what Adam Lanza did that day in December more than six years ago The National Shooting Sports Foundation NSSF which filed an amicus or friend of the court brief sporting Bushmaster said the court was exploiting a narrow exception to thexa0Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act PLCAA that shields gunmakers from civil liability in most instances In a strongly worded and wellreasoned dissent Chief Justice Robinson rejected the majoritys overly broad interpretation of the scope of the limited exception which is contrary to legislative text canons of statutory interpretation and the legislative history of the PLCAA NSSF said in a statement The majoritys decision today is at odds with all other state and federal appellate courts that have interpreted the scope of the exception That exception cancels the gun manufacturers immunity if it knowingly breaks a law applicable to the sale or marketing of the product In other words the plaintiffs believe that Bushmasters advertising scheme violated Connecticuts unfair trade practices law because it encouraged the use of its weapons for unlawful purposesxa0RELATED Supreme Court Takes Up First Gun Rights Case In A Decade Lanza used an AR15 style rife called the XM15 during his rampage The plaintiffs say Bushmaster glorified the weapons militaristic and assaultive qualities tailoring a campaign with depictions of soldiers on patrol and promises of total dominance in combat Such images appealed to disillusioned men supplemented with slogans like consider your man card reissued This crime scene evidence photo provided by the Connecticut State Police shows a Bushmaster rifle in Room 10 at Sandy Hook Elementary School following the December 14 2012 shooting rampage Connecticut State Police via Getty Images Those appeals were especially effective with Lanza they say since he was an avid player of violent video games and aspired to a career as a special operator in the armed forces Though Lanza had access to a cache of weapons  including handguns shotguns two rifles and three swords  the plaintiffs saidxa0Bushmasters promotions prompted Lanza to choose the XM15 from his familys stockpile thereby making his shooting spree far more deadly However Lanza did not himself buy the XM15  he stole the gun from his mother who purchased it lawfully from a retail gun dealership in March 2010 For that reason among others the Connecticut Supreme Court acknowledged the plaintiffs will have a hard time proving their allegation The plaintiffs allege that the defendants wrongful advertising magnified the lethality of thexa0Sandy Hookxa0massacre by inspiring Lanza or causing him to select a more efficiently deadly weapon for his attack the decision reads Proving such a causal link at trial may prove to be a Herculean task Gottlieb went further arguing there is no evidence connecting Lanza with Bushmasters practices There is no evidence the killer was driven by any advertising whatsoever he said This is an affront to the First Amendment as well as the Second Even hinting that the killer was motivated in some way by an advertising message is so far out in the weeds that it may take a map for the court to find its way back The case need not reach a verdict to damage the firearms industry The pretrial discovery phase will give the plaintiffs access to Bushmasters internal communications and other sensitive records which could itself prove harmful to the company An appeal could follow to thexa0US Supreme Court Lanza killedxa027 people Dec

testimony is a prelude to his public appearance on Wednesday before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to be followed by a second private session on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee Wednesdays public hearing will overshadow the others merely by the presence of TV cameras to which both Cohen and the lawmakers will be playing to as they engage in a verbal parley on a variety of issues including the building of Trump Tower Moscow the payoffs to women during the 2016 campaign Trumps business dealings and donations to the presidents inaugural committeexa0 Lawmakers are also girding to ask him questions about a planned Moscow tower project that he pursued well into the 2016 presidential campaign He plans to tell lawmakers Trump asked him about it several timesxa0 He further plans to talk about Trumps lies racism and cheating as a private businessman according to the account Trump and his legal team have repeatedly branded Cohen as a liar and say he cooperated with prosecutors and furnished false information to get a reduced jail sentencexa0xa0xa0xa0xa0 But one topic not the public agenda Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any possible collusion between Trumps team and Moscowxa0 Oversight panel chairman Elijah Cummings coordinated with his counterpart on the House Intel panel Adam Schiff and the two agreed the Russia conversation will happen discussed behind closed doors at the intelligence session while Trumps business dealings will be the focus of the public hearingxa0according to a memo released Sunday by the Oversight panel Lawmakers can dismiss the chairmans guidance and ask whatever they chose but Cohens attorney Lanny Davis also said his client cannot talk about the Russia probe in publicxa0 Senators meanwhile are eager to have Cohen in their crosshairs on Tuesday I think the reason you have him back is when somebody lies to Congress in an investigation like this the questions you might have asked the next witness dont get asked Somebody you might have called doesnt get called Senate intelligence panel member Sen Roy Blunt said Sunday on CBS Face the Nation Inside man Michael Cohen was with Trump for a decade and took part in his campaign  standing with from left Karen and Mike Pence Omarosa Manigault  then a Trump aide now being sued by his campaign for her memoir  and Don King during a campaign stop at the New Spirit Revival Center church in Cleveland Heights Ohio in September 2016 However Republicans are already preparing to cast doubts on Cohens credibility  one of Trumps legal teams major arguments against the presidents former personal attorney I dont know that we believe him this time Blunt notedxa0 Republicans will be just as hard on Cohen as Democrats particularly those closed tied to the presidentxa0xa0 Republican Reps Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows two of Trumps staunches allies on Capitol Hillxa0sent a letter to Cohens attorneys last week saying they intend to press the presidents former personal lawyer onxa0his questionable business dealings his lies to Congress his work for foreign entities andxa0even the fake Women for Cohen social media initiative he commissioned One person who wont be in town for the show is President Trump who jetted off to Vietnam on Monday for his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un But he will have the ability to tweet even with the 12 hour time differencexa0 This week marks Cohens first time before lawmakers since he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timing of talks concerning the building of a Trump Tower Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign Lawmakers have indicated that will be a major topic of interestxa0 Well a great deal starting with why the false statements before our committee when he first appeared Did they go beyond what he told us about Moscow Trump Tower into other areas as well House Intelligence panel chair Rep Adam Schiff said on ABCs This Week on Sundayxa0 Democratic Rep Jim Himes who also sits on the Intelligence panel said he wants to know the same Well you know Michael Cohen is going to jail for lying to my committee So obviously step one is to reask him the questions that he felt he needed to lie to us about when he testified in the last Congress So were going to want to get to the truth allow him to correct the record And then of course the question is okay now that we know the truth what are the followups Its going to be an interesting week in that regard he said Sunday on NBCs Meet the Press Democratic Reps Elijah Cummings left and Adam Schiff right will chair Wednesdays and Thursdays House hearings respectively Himes also said Cohen could be more forthcoming behind closed doors than in Wednesdays public circusxa0 I dont think hes going to say a lot that is classified But he may have some things that he doesnt feel comfortable saying publicly that he then wants to say either to the Senate or to the House Intelligence Committees in closed session he said Last week Cohen got a twomonth reprieve from his deadline to report for his three years in jail with a judge giving him until May 6 One of the reasons cited was his upcoming congressional testimonyxa0 Cohen received a threeyear sentence in December for bank and tax fraud lying to Congress and violating campaign finance lawsxa0 Even though Cohen cant talk about in public whatxa0hexa0told Robert Mueller in the 70 hours he spent talking to that team for the special counsels Russia investigation he will speak publicly about his relationship with the president Cohen attorney Lanny Davis said last Tuesday his client will reveal how Trump is bigoted treats people badly and talk about hes heard the president say disparaging things about black people behind closed doors I believe the issue in 2020 which Michael Cohen can speak to better than anyone is the man lacks character Davis told ABCs The Investigation podcast Hexa0speaks in bigoted words in private which Michael Cohen will tell youxa0He treats people badly He has no moral character in defrauding people in his businesses and going bankrupt and taking cash out and putting people out of work He lacks the moral compass that we expect in our presidentsxa0xa0 But Davis said Cohen will be able to talk about what did you do for Mr Trump for all those years and why Trumps legal team has already made their case against Cohen by painting him as an unreliable witness Both Trumps lawyers and the president himself have pushed back against any comments Cohen may have made to Mueller or will make in public by labeling him as a rat and turn coat who cant be believed Davis conceded that Cohen knows he has axa0deep hole to climb out of in terms of credibility But he argued his client has seen the light and wants to make amends for his past work for the presidentxa0 He wouldnt take a pardon if Trump pleaded with him to take it Why Because it would be dirty Davis told ABC Newsxa0 Cohen has been cooperating with the special counsels probe of Russias role in the 2016 election The US Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York was the lead federal prosecutor earlier this year when Cohen pled guiltyxa0to eight counts including tax fraud and campaign finance violations  that stemmed from the special counsels investigation Cohen also has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timeline of conversations he had with Russian officials about building a Trump Tower Moscow as part of separate investigation by Muellers team He was sentenced to three years in prison and is free on bail until that timexa0 Cohens guilty pleas included a charge of lying to Congress about a Trump Organization real estate project that was slated for Moscow Russia and discussed through the fall of 2016 while the president was running for office He testified in a closed congressional interview that the project he pursued on Trumps behalf was abandoned by the time of the Iowa Caucuses in January 2016 that would be consistent with Trumps political messagingxa0 Mueller later filed documents revealing Cohen said he discussed the proposal with Trump on multiple occasions and with members of the presidents family later in the year  even after Trump became the Republican nominee for presidentxa0xa0 Cohen said he lied out of loyalty to Trumpxa0 Cohen also played a role in hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels left and former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal right I made these misstatements to be consistent with Individual 1s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1 Cohen said at his plea hearing late last yearxa0 Individual 1 is Muellers name for Trump in the investigationxa0 Cohen was also the central figure in a plot to buy the silence of pornographic actress Stormy Daniels who claimed that she had an affair with Trump in 2006xa0 Daniels signed a nondisclosure agreement in exchange for 130000 from Cohen a transaction that he admitted was a violation of campaign finance laws since it amounted to an illegally large contribution benefiting Trumps White House hopesxa0 He said in court that Trump directed him to make the payment suggesting the president was guilty of a crimexa0 In August he pleaded guilty to eight separate charges related to tax dodges falsifying bank documents and the campaign finance violations involving Daniels and another woman former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal Cohen claims that at Trumps request he arranged for the publisher of The National Enquirer to pay McDougal  another selfdescribed past Trump paramour  for the exclusive rights to her life story The magazine never published anything engaging in a practice known as catch and kill in order to help Trump avoid new

country there have been reports of wildfires  Elsewhere on Tuesday the Moroccan air plume left beaches and parks surprisingly busy for February as sunseekers took full advantage of the winter respite and was so warm even pollinating bees were taking advantage of the heat wave Yesterdays hotspot was Kew Gardens in West London which hit 212C 702F  but Bob Ward from the Grantham Research Institute at LSE has warned that although warmer winters might be pleasant they are the result of a climate change trendxa0that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequentxa0 The record breaking temperatures today camexa0after Trawsgoed in West Wales had the highest temperature of 206C 685F Monday which broke a winter record of 197C 675F in Greenwich South East London which had stood for two decades since 1998 Britain has experienced an extraordinary few days of recordbreaking temperatures for February The exceptionally warm weather is thanks to a block weather pattern which is dragging up warm air from the Canary Islands Morocco and southern Spain The pattern is a large area of high pressure that moves in a clockwise direction bringing warm winds from the Canaries meaning more sunlight The dry ground needs less energy to heat up and so it is becoming hotter more easily  which makes it very warm when combined with the southern air flow Conditions in Wales  which has recorded temperatures above 20C 68F two days in a row  are being supercharged by the Foehn Effect phenomenon This is where moist air dries out as it hits hills or mountains allowing temperatures to rise further as the air comes down the other side Meanwhile conversely temperatures in the usually warm Mediterranean have plunged In Thessaloniki in Greece it hovered at around 3C and has even had snow as have parts of Northwest Turkey that also saw wintery flurries The culprits are areas of low pressure over the Atlantic and Eastern Europe trapping warm air over the northwest of the continent The day started with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rose to highs above 20C 68F this afternoon Another hotspot today was Porthmadog in North Wales which reached 208C 694F The warmth follows last Februarys Beast from the East which plunged temperatures below freezing and brought heavy snowfall across the country xa0The unseasonably warm weather is expected to continue for another day for most of Britain before parts of the country face possible thunderstorms later in the week forecasters said Today will be sunny with possible highs of 20C 68F but is unlikely to continue a trend of recordbreaking February temperatures set earlier in the week Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said some parts of southern and western England could be facing thunder on Thursday Tomorrow will be pretty sunny again for most places he said on Tuesday evening There might be a little bit of mist and fog around to start with but that should largely clear It wont be quite as exceptionally warm so I dont think we will break the record we have reached today Bob Ward policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science said Todays record for the UKs winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate change signal that we are seeing in the UK He said the climate was transforming towards warmer wetter winters and hotter drier summers  such as last years heatwave summer  with impacts on people and wildlife While warmer winters might seem pleasant for many people it is worth remembering that this is the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent as well as coastal flooding due to sea level rise he said Tomorrow will be slightly cooler but still above average for the time of yearxa0 Heavy showers are possible on Thursday as temperatures struggle to get above 12C 54Fxa0Friday March 1 will mark the first day of meteorological spring and is expected to be mostly dry before a wet weekend Met Office meteorologist Luke Miall said The weekend doesnt look great its looking wet and windy across the countryxa0Theres lots of uncertainty over the details because its still a long way off but wet and windy seems to be the themexa0 Temperatures recorded in Britain this week are hotter than the Algarve where it was 18C

yesterday While scientists are reluctant to attribute individual weather fronts such as heatwaves and droughts directly to climate change there is little doubt that such events are getting more frequent as our planet heats Friederike Otto a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University said This is one of the clearest signs of climate change that we have seen that winter temperatures are increasing and the likelihood of very warm days in winter has increased quite a lot xa0The fact that spring starts much earlier is one of the very obvious signs of climate change that we see The last four years have been the hottest on record with 2018 ending as the fourthhottest year ever according to the United Nations Last year alone saw devastating forest fires in Greece and California a succession of superstorms in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and recordbreaking drought in Australia Bob Ward policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science LSE said Todays record for the UKs winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate

maximum temperature of 13C 56F forecast for today Mondays record highs were likened to a climate breakdown by Green MP Caroline Lucas Mr Miall said This kind of event is what climate change would expect but we cant directly relate it to climate changexa0 Conditions in Wales were being supercharged by a phenomenon known as the Foehn Effect where moist air dries out as it hits hills or mountains allowing temperatures to rise further as the air comes down the other side Mr Miall added The reason weve got this exceptionally warm weather is all down to a block weather pattern This is dragging up

could experience more recordbreaking warmth The unseasonably warm weather has prompted birds to try nesting butterflies to emerge and hedgehogs to come out of hibernation early experts said Migrant swallows and house martins have even been spotted arriving in the UK more than a month early the RSPB said Conservationists are warning the early start to spring which they say could be linked to climate change could lead to a real crisis for nature if the weather reverts to colder conditions such as those seen in March last year A pollinating bee is pictured seen covered in pollen in an undisclosed location The warning comes after the UK saw the warmest winter day since records began with temperatures topping 20C 68F in several places on Monday and forecasts suggesting the mercury could rise to nearrecords again on Tuesday The RSPBs wildlife team has been getting calls from people reporting early nesting attempts and even ducklings being spotted across the country There are also reports of hibernating hedgehogs and some reptiles waking up earlier than usual and butterflies emerging prompted by the warm weather Birds are travelling ahead of the Saharan plume of warm air which is bringing the mild temperatures to the UK with reports of swallows and house martins in Cornwall Devon and South Wales weeks early the RSPB said Martin Harper the charitys director of global conservation said While the warm weather bright sunshine and abundant sights and sounds of nature undoubtedly make us all feel better they should also ring alarm bells The early signs of spring are likely down to climate change which is bad news for us all As we expect the weather to return to temperatures more traditionally associated with this time of year  as they are forecast to  then there could be a real crisis for our birds insects and other wildlife The Woodland Trusts Natures Calendar scheme which asks the public to track signs of the seasons has been receiving unusually early records of spring this winter  with some as early as November Mild weather has led to records in January of red admiral small tortoiseshell and peacock butterflies and queen wasps which are usually seen in mid to late February or early March Trees including field maples and European larches have been bursting into bud early and blue tits have been spotted making nesting attempts as early as Boxing Day The latest bout of unseasonably warm weather has seen more than 250 records of brimstone butterflies emerging for the first time since February 12 with 163 of the sightings taking place since Friday The butterfly normally comes out around March or April the Trust said Abi Bunker director of conservation and external affairs at the Woodland Trust said Natures Calendar data has increasingly brought into question the way we think about the seasons and to see spring in December no longer seems unusual With butterflies bumblebees and snowdrops being recorded across the festive period we may have to start featuring different species on our Christmas cards But the Natures Calendar project is more than just spotting the seasons data sent in by members of the public enables greater understanding of the repercussions climate change has for our beloved flora and fauna and of the need to act to tackle global warming and other threats to our wildlife By JOHN NAISH FOR THE DAILY MAILxa0 On Sunday afternoon I was sitting in the garden in a Tshirt taking a break from some urgent pruningxa0On a fallen tree trunk nearby a Red Admiral was basking its pulsing wings blissfully warmed by the sun beaming down from a clear blue sky Just as it did again today  and if the forecasters are right for the rest of the week It is utterly gorgeous  but worrying Its only February for goodness sake We should all still be shivering in the depths of winter Instead this past glorious weekend the roads around my home town of Brighton were rammed with sunseekers heading for the beach We tried to escape the melee by heading to a quiet country pub Quiet We had to queue for a table in the flowerdappled garden It felt like a May bank holiday Nature clearly thinks that spring has sprung and then some Parks and gardens are clad in golden daffodils Snowdrops are in full bloom on our lawn Witch hazel and honeysuckles are already emerging And Im in a panic about pruning back our rampant fig trees They should still be sound asleep but instead they are budding wildly Fifteenmonthold Darcy and her mother Kerry enjoy the sunshine and warm weather at Parade Gardens in Bath yesterday Around Britain the story is the same some species of camellia are making a premature appearance patches of wild primroses usually March to May and even early cherry blossom March while scabious poppies and Virginia stock have stayed in flower since the summer having apparently forgotten to die back thanks to a balmy autumn The animal kingdom is stirring prematurely too Naturalists report that the dawn chorus  not usually heard until March  began at the start of this month Song thrushes are even belting out their mating calls while bees have been tricked out of hibernation many weeks early And as for that butterfly in my garden well Ive never spotted one so early in the year before For this latest burst of unseasonal balm  following a remarkably mild winter  we can thank a plume of warm southerly air sweeping up from the Canary Islands sending temperatures into the high teens That is more than twice the normal February average In Londons Kew Gardens the highs have nudged 18c This year is particularly mild says Guy Barter the chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society There are a lot of things in flower that you would not expect at this time of the year Things are running ahead of normal Indeed The Met Office confirmed that today was the hottest February on record as temperatures reached 203c in parts of Wales A group of women enjoy lunch in the sun at Blyth in Northumberland yesterday as the UK enjoys an unseasonably warm day But its not just the sunny West and South 19c thats ablaze The warmest yet February day in Scotland was recorded last week when Aboyne in Aberdeenshire hit 183c on Thursday afternoon This beats the previous high of 179c recorded in Aberdeen in February 1897 One wonders if they were fretting about climate change back then All in all it made for a spectacular weekend for most of us  with the best part of another week of this weather to come  and will be welcome when we get our heating billsxa0 However the unexpected warmth is sowing much confusion in the natural world and threatens summer harvests especially for fruit growers Many of Britains plants have evolved to use winters cold to their advantage In the same way that our bodies need eight hours of sleep in each 24hour cycle plants need a period of dormancy during the colder months if they are to thrive in spring This process called vernalisation requires a sustained period of cold  which the plants take as an instruction to reset their biological clocks in preparation for a new healthy annual cycle For fruit trees this is not just desirable but vital Plants such as figs need about 300 chill hours when the temperature is between 07c to thrive Softer fruit such as blackcurrants can require up to 2000 chill hours to flower at the right time A bee takes pollen from a spring bloom in St Jamess Park in London yesterday If the mild weather persists fruit trees may flower too early  in March or April They would then be vulnerable to a sharp frost that would destroy their blossom warns Barter If that happens they would bear no fruit And if apple pear or blackcurrant plants flower early they may do so at a time when there are fewer bees about with a good chance they would not then be pollinated and so would not fruit Its a huge worry for orchard owners  as well as Britains 40 or so commercial blackcurrant growers who produce about 14000 tons of fruit each year Butterflies may also suffer The winter of 2015 was a warm one  and what followed was a terrible year for these insectsxa0 Cold weather kills viruses and bacteria in the soil that many insects including native species of butterflies and moths are high vulnerable to If temperatures stay relatively high the microbes can decimate insect populationsxa0 Data gathered by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme from more than 1800 sites across the country over 37 years shows higher temperatures affected more than half the species such as the common blue comma peacock and small tortoiseshells There is then a knockon effect on our native birds which if they mate and lay eggs early wont be able to find enough insects to feed their chicks Analysis by conservationists of 30000 nests over the past decade shows birds such as the chaffinch and the robin lay eggs about a week earlier than in the Sixties A similar pattern has been seen for blue tits great tits and swallows And if a proper cold snap should interrupt our mild winter in a month or so vulnerable chicks could struggle to survive A bee collects pollen at National Trusts Wallington Hall near Morpeth in Northumberland last Friday Indeed forecasters are warning that this warm snap may come to a bitter end Meteorologists predict that early March will bring fierce weather sweeping in from the Atlantic with gales and snow blasting parts of Britain Spring still holds an icy shard in its heart Indeed the mild winter to date may be creating the same meteorological conditions that prompted the bitter blast of prolonged cold from Siberia  dubbed the Beast from the East  to come roaring in this time last year This involves a phenomenon called sudden stratospheric warming where layers of air high in the stratosphere above us become unseasonably warm and the resultant change in pressure sucks in freezing air from Siberia Grass fires can develop quickly in dry conditions and raised winds with the possibility of quickly spreading They are often caused deliberately by people but can also happen when controlled fires get out of hand North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said deliberate mountain fires have a hugely detrimental impact on wildlife and the environment When road access is not possible to fight them then they are often left to burn themselves out Every plant insect and bird that thought spring had come early would suffer if this is the case Gardeners and lovers of wildlife are keeping their fingers crossed that any cold snap in the next few weeks will be short  and may actually reset Natures clock It would return fruittree flowering to its normal season and be welcomed by most farmers and fruit growers Mr Barter says The price we may pay though is a depressingly bloomfree gap in spring Thats a worry for the 450 residents of Thriplow in Cambridgeshire who hope to celebrate their 50th Daffodil Fairxa0 Over the past five decades they have planted more than half a million bulbs around the village and their annual fundraising weekend near the end of March is a national event with up to 14000 people flocking to see the spectacle Last year though the entire weekend was laid waste by the Beast from the East This year the number of daffodils could also be depleted Some daffs are already out in the village says Paul Earnshaw who is chair of the Fairs charity committee Daffs do what daffs do People say that you can hurry them up by putting a hairdryer on them  or more sensibly by growing them under polytunnels But if they are coming up early then you cant stop them  you can only be glad to see them Nevertheless the village has developed another strategy to ensure a good display We spread our bets says Earnshaw We have about 117 different varieties which all come up at different times  from very early like the variety called February Gold  to the latest such as pheasant eye which wont come up until April or May Therefore some should be out at the right time The winter weather might be going mildly mad but Thriplows daffodil committee isnt daft Climate change has played a role in pushing winter temperatures to new record highs in the UK experts have suggested While the variability of weather makes it hard to link any single event to climate change global warming is heating up the whole system and making extremes more likely scientists say The UK has seen a new record for winter temperatures set for the second time in two days as the mercury climbed to 208C in Porthmadog Gwynedd North Wales And there has been a run of warm weather with daily maximum temperatures at Kew Gardens in London not dropping below the months average of 74C since February 2 and staying above 15C for at least seven days The weather is dramatically different to a year ago when the first day of spring on March 1 saw the UK gripped by subzero temperatures Grahame Madge Met Office climate spokesman said the warm conditions were caused by high pressure over western Europe warm air coming from the south and dry conditions which helped warm the ground up more quickly Those conditions at the very end of winter come against a backdrop of 1C of warming since preindustrial times as a result of human activity helping lead to record temperatures for the time of year Climate change has made what would have already been an extremely warm event even warmer and is probably responsible for tipping it over the 20C threshold he said Dr Jo House from the University of Bristol said Weather is always variable so it is hard to link a single event to climate change What we do know is that climate change is warming the whole system and makes events like these more likely to happen We can already observe clear trends in higher temperatures and earlier phenological events like flowers coming into bud in many regions throughout the world The longest running record of temperature measurements is in the UK and shows the last decade was 1C warmer than the preindustrial period of 1850 to 1900 This is consistent with observations of global warming Bob Ward policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science said Todays record for the UKs winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate change signal that we are seeing in the UK He said the climate was transforming towards warmer wetter winters and hotter drier summers  such as last years heatwave summer  with impacts on people and wildlife While warmer winters might seem pleasant for many people it is worth remembering that this is the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent as well as coastal flooding due to sea level rise he said xa0 Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Part of the Daily Mail The Mail on Sunday  Metro Media Group,0

a longterm relationship with the juror There was recovered from the officers phone a series of texts which the pair had exchanged at that time which are highly material in this appeal It is clear that the officer initially lied about having any relationship with Ms Jones although she subsequently admitted contacts with her in interview The Court of Appeal quashed the convictions and Edgar Whelan and Lainsbury were ordered to have a retrial Picturedxa0Lynford Brewster who was killed in 2016 The texts from Bryant were uncovered after an investigation was launched by the CPS The messages from the South Wales Police detective read The Murder trial is put back til 1st Not that that matters cos theyll hold u til then if they need to Remember what I sed though as long as you dont know any of the witnesses thats fine I wont be there hardly and Im not a witness anyway so that ok u dont need to worry bout that Dont tell any of them who u r to me tho in case they think Ive told u about it although u know I havent xxx One message also offered Miss Jones a lift from court If ur on the murder ul be finished same time as me most days u can have a lift to mine afterwards if u wanted x Jones replied saying Fab thanks The bus is a nightmare x The probe found Miss Jones also worked with victim Mr Brewsters sister The judgement said She said nothing about her connection to the sister of the deceased At one point she did say something to the effect that she was a teacher at the school but went no further than that She appears to have followed the advice given in the first text mentioned The police officer also failed to say anything to anybody although she was aware that the juror was sitting on the murder trial South Wales Police said Detective Constable Bryant had not committed any criminal offences but she would be investigated by the forces internal disciplinary body Assistant Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said When issues regarding the original trial came to light the matter was voluntarily referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and has been investigated by the South Wales Police Professional Standards Department Our investigation which has also been subject of independent review has not found any evidence that the officer intended to undermine the criminal justice process and following a formal submission to the Crown Prosecution Service the matter will now be dealt with through South Wales Police disciplinary processes Our thoughts remain with the family of Mr Brewster who we have continued to support throughout this difficult timexa0

Associated Press   Published  1312 AEST 20 March 2019     Updated  1724 AEST 20 March 2019      390 View  comments  Michael Sanchez the brother of Jeff Bezos mistress admitted that he struck a deal with the devil and received 200000 from the National Enquirer in exchange for helping the tabloid break the story of the Amazon CEOs extramarital affair Sanchez said he did it to protect his sister Lauren Sanchez and her new flame Bezos because he wanted the news of their romance to become public after both of their spouses were told according to Page Six It doesnt appear as if Lauren Sanchez felt her brothers intentions were good as she cut ties with the man who is not only her sibling but was also a manager and publicist Though Michael Sanchez admits to revealing the affair and leaking text messages to the Enquirer he adamantly denies obtaining intimate photos including selfies of Bezos genitalia I may have helped the Enquirer with their story he told Page Sixxa0 Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is seen left with Lauren Sanchez in Los Angeles in December 2016 Michael Sanchez is seen in the photo on the right The Wall Street Journal reported that Sanchezs brother Michael Sanchez seen right with his sister was paid 200000 by the publisher of the National Enquirer for intimate text messages exchanged between his sister and Bezos Bezos and Sanchez are yet to be seen in public as an official couple after the National Enquirer published a story in January about their affair and message exchange But I never had access to the penis selfies It was those penis selfies that Bezos says the Enquirers parent company American Media Inc was using to extort himxa0 The Wall Street Journalxa0reported on Monday that AMI paid Michael Sanchez 200000 to obtain intimate texts between the Amazon CEO and his sister The Journals finding attributed to people familiar with the matter parallels the conclusion reached by private investigators working for Bezos as of early February Those investigators reportedly found that Michael Sanchez had leaked the texts to the Enquirer although they didnt appear to conclude who might have paid for them Bezos has said AMI threatened to publish explicit photos of him unless he stopped investigating how the Enquirer obtained his private exchanges and publicly declared that the Enquirers coverage of him was not politically motivated Last monthxa0Bezos and Sanchez are reported to have enjoyed a secret reunion in one of Bezos multimillion dollar Manhattan properties around Valentines Day But Page Six reported on Tuesday that sources close to Bezos strongly deny that there was a date In fact the two have not met up since the story of their relationship became public according to a source A lot of this has to do with their decision to lay low and spend time with their kids who didnt get a warning about the Enquirer story and now have to deal with the intense public interest and the paparazzi in pursuit a source told Page Sixxa0 The source laid part of the blame on Michael Sanchez Michael isnt doing her and Jeff any favors by keeping his sisters name in the press the source saidxa0 He may genuinely believe he is defending Lauren but in many ways he is actually doing more todoom her relationship with Jeffxa0 The relationship between the siblings appears to be rupturedxa0 In the weeks following the National Enquirers expose Michael Sanchez contacted The Washington Post the newspaper Bezos owns to act as an off the record point of contact for information about his sisterxa0xa0xa0 For obvious reasons I cant go into detail on email and all of my communications must be completely Confidentialxa0 Im reaching out to you offtherecord I will be your single pointofcontact for anything Laurenrelated Id appreciate it if we can keep open one line of communication he said in an email in January days after the Enquirer published its explosive piecexa0xa0 As the weeks went by details emerged that he was one of the people being questioned by Bezos private security lead Gavin De Becker to identify the source of the leakxa0 De Becker has not named him explicitly as the source but he is the only person he has named as a subject of his investigationxa0 Multiple sources at AMI told The Daily Beast that it was Michael Sanchez who gave them the story and they have also claimed he acted as a leak for other clientsxa0 In January Bezos announced he was divorcing his wife of more than 26 years MacKenzie Bezos seen left with Jeff Bezos just days before the Enquirer broke the story about his affair with Sanchez right On Tuesday night The Washington Post published its communication with Michael Sanchez and revealed the fact that he and Lauren were no longer speakingxa0 It also published for the first time details of his 2010 bankruptcy filing and the fact that Lauren a former TV host turned pilot had loaned him 165000xa0 After the story went live Michael Sanchez hit out angrily at its tone and said in an email to The Post Its pretty simple Jeff Bezos had an extramarital affair lied about it in his tonedeaf divorce tweet and has engaged in a scorchedearth campaign to cover up responsibility for the demise of two families and the failure to protect the privacy and technology of the man practically owns the cloud culminating in a Washington Post hit piece written by Sarah Ellison the writer I handpicked to tell the whole truth According to the Post Michael Sanchez has sold other clients stories in the past Among them is Scottie Nell Hughesxa0 She said she was heartbroken to learn of a recording which proved Michael Sanchez had discussed details of her case against Fox News in 2017 with the publicationxa0 Hughes sued the network alleging she was raped by Charles Paynexa0xa0 In his interview with The Post Michael Sanchez failed to mention that he and his sister had not spoken for weeksxa0xa0 I have been managing my sister since the day she came home from the hospital for 49 yearsxa0 Thats a message I want to be out there Even when she and I have had fights when we were kids in college or whenever if anyone says a word against her I defend her and protect her to the end Thats the essence of my relationship with my sister he saidxa0 It seems however that it was Lauren Sanchez who was the protector in recent years loaning her brother at least 165000 when he field for bankruptcy in 2010 and giving him a job as her manager and publicistxa0 Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are yet to be seen in public as an official couple after the National Enquirer published a story in January about their affair and message exchange hot off the back of Bezos announcement on January 9 that he and wife MacKenzie were separating after 26 years of marriagexa0 Private investigators working for Bezos concluded that Michael Sanchez who is a supporter of President Trump leaked intimate text messages from the couple to one another to the National Enquirerxa0xa0xa0 In a interview withxa0Vanity Fair Michael Sanchez denied any involvement in the leak of belowthebelt selfiesxa0 I had nothing to do with leak of the dk pics Thats the important thing Sanchez said adding its likely Lauren shared themxa0 Michael Sanchez played coy in that interview at one point saying Im not saying I didnt do something Until I go under oath what I can tell you now is that ever since April 20 when I met Jeff my only goal has been to protect Jeff and Laurenxa0xa0xa0xa0 On February 7 Bezos penned a post on Medium including what he said were emails from Dylan Howard the chief content officer ofxa0American Media

Updated  1717 AEST 17 April 2019      387 View  comments   The US Attorney General on Tuesday struck down a decision that had allowed some asylum seekers to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge in a ruling that expands indefinite detention for some migrants who must wait months or years for their cases to be heard The first immigration court ruling from President Donald Trumps newly appointed Attorney General William Barr is in keeping with the administrations moves to clamp down on the asylum process as tens of thousands of mostly Central Americans cross into the United States asking for refugexa0 US immigration courts are overseen by the Justice Department and the Attorney General can rule in cases to set legal precedent Barrs ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration This year the administration implemented a policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases work their way through backlogged courts a policy which has been challenged with a lawsuitxa0 US Attorney General William Barr has struck down a decision that had allowed some asylum seekers to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge in a ruling that expands indefinite detention for some migrants who must wait months or years for their cases to be heard Several top officials at the Department of Homeland Security were forced out this month over Trumps frustrations with an influx of migrants seeking refuge at the US southern border Barrs decision applies to migrants who crossed illegally into the United States Typically those migrants are placed in expedited removal proceedings  a faster form of deportation reserved for people who illegally entered the country within the last two weeks and are detained within 100 miles 160 km of a land border Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond But before Barrs ruling those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States Barr wrote Barr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude or if the Department of Homeland Security DHS decides to release them by granting them parole DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons Barr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions The decisions full impact is not yet clear because it will in large part depend on DHS ability to expand detention said Steve Vladeck a law professor at the University of Texas The number of asylum seekers who will remain in potentially indefinite detention pending disposition of their cases will be almost entirely a question of DHSs detention capacity and not whether the individual circumstances of individual cases warrant release or detention Vladeck said DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision The agency had written in a brief in the case arguing that eliminating bond hearings for the asylum seekers would have an immediate and significant impact ondetention operations Barrs ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration A migrant from Honduras is seen in January passing a child over the border fence In early March Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE the DHS agency responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants in the country illegally said the average daily population of immigrants in detention topped 46000 for the 2019 fiscal year the highest level since the agency was created in 2003xa0 Last year Reuters reported that ICE had modified a tool officers have been using since 2013 when deciding whether an immigrant should be detained or released on bond making the process more restrictive The decision will have no impact on unaccompanied migrant children who are exempt from expedited removal Most families are also paroled because of a lack of facilities to hold parents and children together Michael Tan from the American Civil Liberties Union said the rights group intended to sue the Trump administration over the decision and immigrant advocates decried the decision Barrs decision came after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to review the case in October Sessions resigned from his position in November leaving the case to Barr to decide Before Barrs ruling those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution

host and creator of PragerU The reactions of many on the left to the case of Jussie Smollett prove two important things 1 There is little racism in America  2 The leftwhite and blackis morally and psychologically impaired  There is no doubt that most Americans on the left including black Americans are distraught over the fact that Smollett faked the racist attack on him Apparently leftists Democratic leaders and most depressingly many of his fellow blacks wish Smollett had been attacked by white racist homophobes Rep Eric Swalwell DCalif a white leftist tweeted I hope this was not something that Mr Smollett did to himself or created   Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC there has been an atmosphere of menace and hate since Donald Trump was elected president which made people want to believe Smolletts story Exactly Capehart a black leftist wanted to believe that racists yelling This is MAGA country beat up blacks Another black leftist who writes hate columns for The Washington Post Nana Efua Mumford wrote I wanted to believe Smollett I really did Again exactly Mumford wanted to believe that racists yelling This is MAGA country beat up blacks Corey Townsend the social media editor of The Root a blackoriented website founded in 2008 by Harvard black studies scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr opened his column on his private doubts that Smollett was attacked as he claimed with the words I wanted to be wrong Three paragraphs later But still I wanted to be wrong  This should tell you a great deal about how morally and psychologically sick the left is And their reactions prove how little racism there really is in America Heres the proof of both these assertions When American Jews even most leftwing Jews heard of the mass killing of Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue how many were hoping the shooter was truly an antiSemite and how many were hoping he was a mentally deranged individual who could have just as easily shot up a church  Or if a wellknown Jew had been beaten at 2 am on a Chicago street how many American Jews would have wanted the attackers to be Jewhaters and how many would have wished they were just thugs who wanted money As a Jew who has been deeply involved in Jewish culture all my life I am pretty certain the majority of Jewscertainly liberal and conservative Jews and even most leftwing Jewswould have wished that neither the Pittsburgh synagogue nor the theoretical attack on a Chicago street I conjured up were perpetrated by antiSemites  Why is that Why do almost all Jews wish attackers of Jews not be antiSemites but so many blacks and so many white leftists wish Smollett had been attacked by racists Because Jews want to believe there is little antiSemitism in America while most black leftists and most white leftists want to believe there is a lot of racism in America And why is that Because the left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in historynamely that America is a racist country  If just 1 of 5 black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced You know this a great country for anyone including a black person to live in and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks or any other race or ethnicity that would end the Democrats chances of winning national elections The Democratic Party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America And what about the personal Why do so many black Americans living in the freest country for all its citizensand in the least racist multiracial multiethnic country in historywant to believe America is racist That is one of the most important questions all Americans need address at this time And there is another one

Photo Paul ArchuletaGetty Images nWalter E WilliamsnnWEWilliamsn Walter E Williams PhD a columnist for The Daily Signal was a professor of economics at George Mason University until his death Dec 2 2020 Federal prosecutors have charged more than 50 people involved in cheating and bribery in order to get their children admitted to some of the nations most prestigious colleges and universities such as Georgetown Yale Stanford University of Texas University of Southern California and UCLA They often paid more than 100000 to rig SAT or ACT exams In some instances they bribed college officials and secured their childrens admissions to elite schools through various fraud schemes As corrupt and depraved as these recent revelations are they are only the tip of the iceberg of generalized college corruption and gross dishonesty According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 70 percent of white high school graduates in 2016 enrolled in college and 58 percent of black high school graduates enrolled in college However that year only 37 percent of white high school graduates tested as collegeready but colleges admitted 70 percent of them Roughly 17 percent of black high school graduates tested as collegeready but colleges admitted 58 percent of them About 40 percent of college freshmen must take at least one remedial course To deal with illprepared students professors dumb down their courses so that students can get passing grades Colleges also set up majors with little or no academic content so as to accommodate students with limited academic abilities Such majors often include the term studies ethnic studies cultural studies gender studies or American studies  The major selected by the most illprepared students sadly enough is education When students SAT scores are ranked by intended major education majors place 26th on a list of 38 One gross example of administrative dishonesty surfaced at the University of North Carolina A learning specialist hired to help UNC athletes found that 60 percent of the 183 members of the football and basketball teams read between fourth and eighthgrade levels About 10 percent read below a thirdgrade level These athletes both graduated from high school and were admitted to UNC More than likely UNC is not alone in these practices because sports are the moneymaking center of many colleges Its nearly impossible to listen to college presidents provosts and other administrators talk for more than 15 minutes or so before the words diversity and inclusion drop from their lips But theres a simple way to determine just how committed they are to their rhetoric  Ask your average college president provost or administrator whether he bothers promoting political diversity among faculty Ill guarantee that if he is honestor even answers the questionhe will say he doesnt believe in that kind of diversity and inclusion According to a recent study professors who are registered Democrats outnumber their Republican counterparts by a 12to1 ratio In some departments such as history Democratic registered professors outnumber their Republican counterparts by a 33to1 ratio The fact is that when college presidents and their coterie talk about diversity and inclusion theyre talking mostly about pleasing mixtures of race and sex Years ago their agenda was called affirmative action racial preferences or racial quotas  These terms fell out of favor and usage as voters approved initiatives banning choosing by race and courts found solely racebased admissions unconstitutional People had to repackage their racebased agenda and call it diversity and inclusion  Some were bold enough to argue that diversity produces educational benefits to all students including white students Nobody has bothered to scientifically establish just what those benefits are  For example does a racially diverse undergraduate student body lead to higher scores on graduate admissions tests such as the GRE LSAT and MCAT  By the way Israel Japan and South Korea are among the worlds least racially diverse nations In terms of academic achievement their students run circles around diversitycrazed Americans Im not sure about what can be done about education But the first step toward any solution is for the American people to be aware of academic fraud that occurs at every level of education COPYRIGHT 2019 CREATORSCOM nThe Daily

local income taxes in addition to the federal income taxyet Florida is booming with a budget surplus while New York is mired in debt Only 50 years ago New York had four times the population of Florida and now Florida is larger than New York The sound economic state of Florida is not the only subject DeSantis is touting He won applause from the dinner crowd when he mentioned his executive orders

and chaos over vote counting that dates back to BushGore in 2000 DeSantis has other victories in his short time in office He has named three conservatives to the state Supreme Court transforming it from a liberal to a solid conservative majority He has also announced plans to sign an executive order scrapping the Common Core public school curriculum replacing it with a strong American civics course As a new Florida resident what amazes me is why hightax states dont get it The facts are there for anyone to see except for those who deliberately refuse to see them And thats the problem In the case of New York New Jersey Connecticut California and other Democratrun states ideology appears to have eclipsed reality If Cuomo thinks DeSantis is stealing residents from New York maybe he should consider whether his policy of stealing taxpayer earnings and demanding that residents pay even more isnt the real reason for the exodus It is not a difficult question to answer In addition to

business owner with over two decades of experience at Americas leading technology firms He serves as program chairperson for the Lincoln Club of Orange County a probusiness PAC President Donald Trump last fall floated the idea of endingnuniversal birthright citizenship by way of executive order  The reaction from the political and chattering classes wasnuniformly hysterical Democrats called it racist Many Republicans includingnthenoutgoing Speaker of the House Paul Ryan dismissed the move asnobviously unconstitutional  Yet the case for ending birthright citizenship is quitenstrong on both legal and economic grounds  The text of the Constitution does not define who qualifiesnfor American citizenship and it gives Congress exclusive power overnnaturalization The 14th Amendment which Congress passed in 1868xa0tonenshrine core legal rights for newly freed slaves and their children grantsncitizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States andnsubject to the jurisdiction thereofxa0 That last clausesubject to the jurisdiction thereofgenerates the current controversy over birthright citizenship Advocates of the status quo argue that a child born to illegal immigrants or tourists clearly qualifies since the newborn child is subject to our laws The federal government has adhered to this interpretation only since 1940   Birthright Citizenship A Fundamental Misunderstanding of the 14th Amendment Nowadays each year approximately 200000 children are born in the United States to foreign tourists students and temporary guest workers according to the Center for Immigration Studies And roughly the same number are born to illegal immigrants according to Pew Research The government grants US citizenship to all of them The 14th Amendments authors would have disagreed with thisnpractice Sen Lyman Trumbull of Wisconsin a key voice in the adoption of thenamendment explicitlynsaid the phrase subject to the jurisdiction thereof means not owingnallegiance to anyone else namely a foreign government He went on to say Itnis only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction who arensubject to our laws that we think of making citizens  This is a reference to partial territorial jurisdiction As John Eastman former dean of the Chapman School of Law has said this is different from complete political jurisdiction which entails allegiance to the political sovereign Just a few years after the amendments adoption the SupremenCourt confirmed that birthright citizenship is not universal In the SlaughterHousencases of 1872 the court said the jurisdiction clause was intended to exclude childrennof ministers consuls and citizens or subjects of foreign states born withinnthe United States In other words the amendments framers didnt intend tongrant citizenship to people who owed loyalty to a foreign government or tribeneven though they were born on US soil In fact it wasnt until 1924 thatnCongress decided to offer citizenship to Native Americans and their children  Nonetheless modern interpretations of the 14th Amendment continue to ignore the authors clear intenta fact that many foreign nationals exploit Consider the perverse practice of birth tourism in which foreigners sneak across the border or come to the United States legally on tourist visas give birth in US hospitals and then return home with their children Once those children grow up they can sponsor their parents spouses and siblings for green cards Up to 36000 birth tourism babies gain citizenship each year according to the Center for Immigration Studies  The United States is one of the only developed nations innthe world that offers birthright citizenship to the children of tourists andnillegal immigrants All European Union countries have abolished the practice ofngranting birthright citizenship irrespective of the parents immigrationnstatus So have Australia and New Zealand  The president wouldnt need an act of Congress to change hownexecutive agencies interpret and apply the 14th Amendments jurisdictionalnclause He could simply instruct the Social Security Administration and StatenDepartment to issue Social Security numbers and passports only to children bornnto US citizens and legal permanent residents  The executive branch previously exercised this authority inn1995 when the State Department barred automatic citizenship for children bornnto foreign diplomats  These concerns over who is eligible to birthrightncitizenship are more than just legal and constitutional The status quonencourages more illegal immigration which ultimately harms American taxpayersn Foreigners know that if they illegally journey to the United States and give birth their children will be eligible for a host of welfare benefitsand the parents can share in these spoils Eightyseven percent of households headed by illegal immigrant parents utilize at least one welfare program according to US Census Bureau data By contrast only half of native households rely on any form of welfare  States are flailing under this financial burden The averagenCalifornia household for instance pays nearlyn2400 a year to support the states illegal immigrant populationnwhich at almost 3 million is the largest in the country The total cost tonthe country as a whole is 135nbillion a year by one estimate  Ending universal birthright citizenship would help deternillegal immigration and provide substantial relief to American taxpayers Letsnhope the president moves forward with his executive order nThe Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like

York Times bestselling author whose latest book is The Authoritarian Moment How the Left Weaponized Americas Institutions Against Dissent Rep Ilhan Omar DMinn has unleashed a barrage of openly antiSemitic commentary She suggested that Israel had hypnotized the world She recently suggested that Jewish money lay behind American support for Israel Finally she suggested that American Israel supporters are representatives of dual loyalty  Her fellow Democrats shielded her from blowback by subsuming a resolution that condemns her antiSemitism within a broader resolution that condemns intolerance of all types  Many of them suggested that labeling Omars antiSemitism actually represents a type of censorshipan attempt to quash debate about Israel though none of Omars comments even critiqued the Israeli government and though many on the left have made antiIsrael arguments without invoking antiSemitism Now Omars defenders have come out of the woodwork to suggest that criticism of her antiSemitism was somehow responsible for the white supremacist shooting of 50 innocent people in a mosque in Christchurch New Zealand  Two protesters New York University students and best friends Leen Dweik and Rose Asaf confronted Chelsea Clinton who had gently chided Omar for her Jew hatred  After all that you have done all the Islamophobia that you have stoked Dweik screamed this right here is the result of a massacre stoked by people like you and the words you put out in the world  Fortynine people died because of the rhetoric you put out there  Dweik it should be noted has called for the complete elimination of Israel Her message was parroted by terror supporter Linda Sarsour who tweeted I am triggered by those who piled on Representative Ilhan Omar and incited a hate mob against her until she got assassination threats now giving condolences to our community What we need you to do is reflect on how you contribute to islamophobia and stop doing that  Meanwhile mainstream commentators attempted to use the New Zealand antiMuslim terror attack to blame critics of radical Islam Omer Aziz writing for The New York Times slammed Jordan Peterson for calling Islamophobia a word created by fascists and Sam Harris for calling it intellectual blood libel  Bill Maher has come in for similar criticism so have I mostly for a video I cut in 2014 in which I read off poll statistics from various Muslim countries on a variety of topics concluding that a huge percentage of Muslims believed radical things Heres the truth Radical Islam is dangerous The Islamic world has a serious problem with radical Islam And large swaths of the Muslim world are in fact hostile to Western views on matters ranging from freedom of speech to womens rights  To conflate that obvious truth with the desire to murder innocents in Christchurch is intellectual dishonesty of the highest sort If we want more Muslims living in liberty and freedom we must certainly demolish white supremacismand we must also demolish radical Islam devotees of which were responsible for an estimated 84000 deaths in 2017 alone most of those victims Muslim  And heres another truth AntiSemitism is ugly whether its coming from white supremacists or Ilhan Omar Making that point has nothing to do with the killing of Muslims in Christchurch  So long as the media continue to push the narrative that criticism of Islam is tantamount to incitement of murder radical Islam will continue to flourish  So long as the media continue to cover for the dishonest argument that criticism of antiSemitism forwards the goals of white supremacists antiSemitism will continue to flourish Honest discussion about hard issues isnt incitement COPYRIGHT 2019 CREATORSCOM nThe Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you

After getting married the decision to take on my husbands last name was a difficult one In addition to the financial cost and social awkwardness of changing your identity the process is so laborintensive that theres an app for that Seriously For 99 you can change your name in minutes on HitchSwitch a concierge service that promises to take the mystery confusion and stress out of changing your name Sounds like a deal  As a public writer producer and commentator who spent years building name recognition the decision to change my last name felt even more complicated Not only would I have to deal with the legal and social repercussions but Id have to worry about losing readers and followers and confusing the TV hosts that I was just getting to know  In sum I feared Id have to start over Plus keeping my maiden name would afford me a level of legal protection should any stalkers arise But ultimately I wanted nothing more than to be unified with my husband and future children under the same last name and for me that pro outweighed all the cons Interestingly enough feminists are now questioning why any woman would do thisas if keeping your fathers last name will bring down the patriarchy Why are women still taking their husbands name In February my husband and I took a belated twoweek honeymoon Upon my return I was ready This is it I thought Shortterm pain for longterm gain The one thing I thought I had going for me was that blue checkmark on Twitter In the most superficial way I thought This will show people that with my new last name Im still legit With a bevy of social media accounts bios and more I acted fast Consistency I thought was key to avoiding confusion I notified my IT department all the organizations I work with and swiftly changed my Twitter username I was ecstatic to learn I could get KelseyBolar without any weird characters Things were going great Back from an amazing Twitterfree honeymoon Im also excited to share that Im taking on my hubbys last nameKelsey Bolar Pronounced like Polar but with a BSo whatd I miss pictwittercomz0zvYVTpxD Until shortly after making the announcementthere was no longer a blue checkmark next to my Twitter handle Caught up in a rush of fire and fury my thumbs were ready to take to Twitter and accuse them of discriminating against me How could a company that claims to be committed to equality punish women for taking on their husbands last names Given Twitters reputation among conservatives I was confident Id gin up enough outrage to publicly shame them into giving me the blue checkmark back And Id be fighting for a greater good No one deserves to be punished for getting married I thought But as Ben Shapiro likes to say Facts dont care about your feelings And the fact is Twitter had a policy for changing your last name that I was completely unaware of I put my accusations on hold and decided to reach out to a contact at Twitter to explain the situation In addition to detailing the mechanics I shared the personal toll I feared my name change could have on my career and how losing my silly superficial status as a public figure on their platform was making it worse In short I took responsibility for failing to follow their policies but explained it was unintentional My contact responded in kind and assured me someone would look into it Out of the blue less than two weeks later my blue checkmark was back If Twitter had refused to reinstate it the social media giant would have deserved every ounce of outrage I was prepared to launch But instead I resisted the temptation and thereby avoided making false salacious accusations Because of that the situation was handled in a respectful manner This little scenario reminded me of a basic truth Civil engagement must come before outrage To be sure some situations demand a fiery response and not all situations get resolved like mine But as a rule we ought to engage with others in good faith rather than assuming the worst Youand the culture we live inwill be better for it As for my new last name its been weird getting used to being Kelsey Bolar But already its worth it Why Because theres nothing like taking that final step to formally unite as husband and wife  nThe Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you Donate nown ntttJoin the millions of people who benefit from The Daily Signals fair

demand the halt of deportations of illegal immigrants and an end to family detentions Photo Bastiaan SlabbersNurPhotoGetty Images The Trump administration is exploring the legality of transporting illegal immigrants who the government cant detain to sanctuary cities which by definition welcome illegal immigrants xa0 Prominent Democrats say they oppose the idea and even supporters say President Donald Trump could be trolling Democrats in a public relations move  If Trump moves forward with the notion it almost certainly would be litigated  Heres a look at key questions surrounding the proposal  1 Where Would Illegal Immigrants Be Transported More than 170 cities and counties have some sort of sanctuary law prohibiting local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities and in some cases jurisdictions may even obstruct enforcement This includes most large cities such as New York Los Angeles and Chicago   Thats according to data from the Center for Immigration Studies a think tank favoring strict immigration policies which has a map of sanctuary cities on its website Local sanctuary jurisdictions span 26 states  California home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a Democrat who is highly critical of Trump is a sanctuary state  Just out The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the State of California which is well known or its poor management  high taxes Pelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said in a statement Friday Using human beingsincluding little childrenas pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable and in some cases criminal Its not clear exactly how the Department of Homeland Security which oversees Customs and Border Protection as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement would determine which sanctuary cities or counties would receive illegal immigrants  The entire matter is still under review said Larry Kudlow assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the National Economic Council I dont know that we will be transporting I dont know that decision has been made The president has talked about it The decision is going to be up to him Kudlow told The Daily Signal during a press gaggle Tuesday at the White House  We are searching for border security that is so essential We think a lot of changes in the immigration laws are going to be necessary Kudlow said xa0At some point in due course he will make some determinations on that We have not made decisions on a lot of these things Kudlow added  You cant tell me that he isnt right when 100000 people a month now are crossing the border illegally You cant tell me something shouldnt be done Its just common sense Its an economic issue Its a security issue Its a drug trafficking issue Its a kids trafficking issue Its really insane He will make the decision on that Its not my call its his call 2 xa0Why Would Trump Want to Release Illegal Immigrants Anywhere in US  Trump doesnt want to release illegal border crossers but Immigration and Customs Enforcement lacks detention space to hold them and there is a shortage of immigration judges to adjudicate deportation hearings and asylum claims  Under federal law if an illegal border crosser claims asylum authorities cannot send him or her back into Mexico The matter must be adjudicated through a hearing  Those who claim asylum have to submit to a credible fear interview while others face a deportation hearing before an immigration judge  It can take eight years before such a hearing is held and many illegal immigrants dont show up for a hearing or interview These circumstances lead to the de facto policy of xa0catch and releasewith the release being inside the country   Ideally we shouldnt be releasing illegal immigrants into the country at all but as long as there is a shortage of judges and Congress wont approve additional detention space for ICE the government does Ira Mehlman spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform told The Daily Signal  To the degree Congress wont act we might as well release them on the steps of San Francisco City Hall Mehlman said If you have to keep releasing people you might as well release then in communities that say they want them Mehlman added This puts sanctuary cities to the test Do you really want them or are you just grandstanding  3 Would It Be Legal The New York Times reported five days ago that the idea got some pushback inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE officials balked at the notion of moving migrants to detention facilities in different areas the newspaper reported insisting that Congress only authorizes the agency to deport immigrants not relocate them internally according to DHS officials  However Trump is bringing in new leadership for the Department of Homeland Security after forcing out Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on April 7  Since the Times and others reported on the legal questions Brandon Judd president of the National Border Patrol Council a labor union and former ICE acting Director Thomas Homan both have said the move would be legal xa0 A former Justice Department lawyer Hans von Spakovsky said no specific provision of law prevents it  Theres no restriction theres no legal limit in federal immigration law that says the Department of Homeland Security can only release detained illegal aliens in particular locations von Spakovsky now a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation said Monday night on Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business Network  I dont see anything in the law that would prevent the president from doing this he said But Democratic lawmakers contend the move would be illegal because funds were not authorized for this purpose xa0xa0xa0 If the administration wants to send a message to Democrats let us send this message to the president If your immigration policies are not fixing the problem but only cause chaos and focus on keeping people out they will always fail House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson DMiss said in a prepared statement Playing politics with the countrys homeland security has been a mainstay of the Trump administration since day one The American people want it to end xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0 Regarding congressional Democrats objections von Spakovsky said on Fox Business Network the lawmakers didnt say why its illegal  You didnt hear them citing any particular statute or provision of federal immigration law so I think they are just making that assertion really without any support he said  Transporting illegal immigrants within the interior of the US would not be a new policy von Spakovsky added  Look keep in mind over the past many years for example when unescorted minors have been caught at the border the Department of Homeland Security has been transporting them all over the country to join other members of their families guardians and things like that he said This has been happening for years If the appropriations process is the only legal question that likely could be addressed said Art Arthur a former federal immigration judge who was general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service now ICE xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0 Illegal immigrants that are released are formally put on parole Arthur told The Daily Signal  Arthur now a resident fellow for law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies said the law allows an immigration judge or the secretary of homeland security to place conditions on that parole  In this case they could be required to go to certain locations as a condition of parole at no cost to the government he said  It would be at no cost because a judge could order an immigrantas a condition of paroleto live in a certain location or risk being arrested  With regard to local costs that follow relocation sanctuary cities and counties already are magnets for illegal immigrants The added costs of being a home to illegal immigrants falls disproportionately on a few communities near the border as well as innercity Los Angeles and parts of Florida and North Carolina Arthur said  Transporting wouldnt deter illegal border crossers but it might apportion the problem more equally among jurisdictions  Mehlman said the policy likely wouldnt have to be specifically budgeted by Congress because the government already transports illegal immigrants for various reasons  This is not authorized in the budget specifically but catch and release isnt authorized in the budget Mehlman said We already pay for transporting unaccompanied minors to their nearest relatives xa0 4 Whats the Harm Besides not solving any problems with illegal border crossings the policy being considered by Trump could create new problems Arthur warned Sanctuary jurisdictions generally in heavily Democratic areas usually encourage illegal immigrants to fill out census forms already he said xa0 You have to consider the census Arthur said Increasing the populations of sanctuary jurisdictions is just going to give them more political power not less Such a policy also would move illegal immigrants to locations that make it harder for the federal government to track them the former immigration judge said  This puts ICE in a position to try to find people in sanctuary communities that already make it difficult for them he said  Lastly Arthur said even if the legal issues regarding authorizing funds are fully addressed the costs of busing people apprehended at the border for eight hours into San Francisco has realworld consequences xa0 nThe Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you Donate nown Fred Lucas is chief news

reporters after meeting with them in the Oval Office at the White House on July 19 2016 Photo Mark WilsonGetty Images Actions by Justice Department officials in spying on a Donald Trump campaign adviser in 2016 could be a crime or merely an administrative offense legal experts say  Crimes could include perjury or misleading a court they say while disciplinary action for an administrative offense could mean being fired or losing a law license  Testifying last week before two separate congressional panels Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Departments Office of Inspector General report about the surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page will be released in May or June  Barr also indicated that he planned a further review of xa0government spying on the Trump campaign  Whats known is that the Obama administrations Justice Department obtained a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA to conduct electronic surveillance on Page in October 2016  The inspector generals review is looking at whether Justice Department or FBI officials did anything improper in obtaining the warrant approved by a federal judge Before looking at the legality the department should examine the process behind getting a FISA warrant against a presidential campaign Thats something that should be approved by the attorney general first John Yoo a former assistant US attorney general under President George W Bush told The Daily Signal  Domestic spying on political opponents was a big part of what prompted the FISA law in the 1970s after President Richard Nixons administration the goal being to put a check in place  The whole point of FISA was because Nixon was spying on political opponents said Yoo now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley This seems to have violated the purpose of FISA which is to make sure surveillance is always merited and is not political After the Watergate scandal which led to Nixons resignation Congress was concerned about how the Nixon administration used the FBI and the CIA to target political opponents  Sen Frank Church DIdaho chaired a select Senate committee that investigated intelligence gathering The 1978 FISA law was an outgrowth of what was called the Church Committee  Prosecutable crimes might have been committee by Justice Department personnel said Robert Ray who as an independent counsel completed the investigation of President Bill Clinton  The FISA court is in place to ensure the careful use of tools in the tool box and to have oversight of the potential collision with the political process Ray told The Daily Signal This is always a big deal when you mix politics and prosecutions and is always dangerous Ray said the potential criminal charge that came to mind was perjury if Justice Department lawyers seeking the FISA warrant were dishonest in making the application to the judge  Intentionally misleading a court in a document that is sworn to under oath would be perjury Ray said But you would have to prove the person knowingly provided false information Misleading might not be enough Ray said the Justice Departments Office of Professional Responsibility might look at the matter to determine whether an official committed an act that requires discipline or dismissal The matter could be referred to the state bar of any practicing lawyer who is accused of providing misleading information  If this matter has the attorney generals attention then it is all on the table Ray said It could examine sending this to the OPR whether there was commission of a crime any and all of the above It doesnt seem likely that the FISA application was misleading though said Charles Stimson a former federal prosecutor and former military judge  Stimson noted that a page in the FISA application for a warrant explained that the information was based on an opposition research dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele  Although the application did not say it was paid for by Hillary Clintons presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee Stimson said the application letter was clear that the document was opposition research directed against Trump  From a pure legal standpoint it was accurate Stimson now manager of the national security law program at The Heritage Foundation told The Daily Signal  It arguably wasnt completely forthcoming he said But the fact is a federal district court judge had the information and ruled on it and reauthorized surveillance  There is a gray zone It didnt say Hillary Clinton paid for it and that it wasnt verified However Stimson noted that a court could require Justice Department lawyers to explain why their lack of information in the application wasnt a case of trying to defraud the court He also said a bar complaint could lead to the loss of a law license  But department lawyers have a reason to be forthcoming with FISA court judges Stimson added  There is an ongoing relationship with the Department of Justice and those lawyers Stimson said The last thing these lawyers want to do is burn their credibility David Kris an assistant attorney general during the Obama administration argues that although special counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to give Trump an edge in the 2016 election the larger Russia investigation itselfas well as the FISA warrant on Pagewas still legitimate Kris wrote in the Lawfare blog There is the Steele dossier which was first publicly revealed in January 2017 but was in the FBIs hands before then People argue about the extent to which the Steele dossier has held up the best and most recent assessment that I have seen here is that it has held up quite well  But in any event the document was properly taken seriously then given Steeles history as a former British MI6 officer and reliable informant as documented in the Carter Page FISA applications  There was a lot of justifiable investigative activity into the campaign and campaign officials and their relationship with Russia and the Russian government  However Stimson contends that Barr has legitimate reasons for wanting to review the matter that go beyond the FISA warrant  The attorney general of the United States should want to know how a counterintelligence investigation against a leading presidential candidate began Stimson said He will want to look at the entire matter How did it get to the point of a FISA warrant Maybe it was predicated entirely on the dossier Maybe there was some there there nThe Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you Donate nown Fred Lucas is chief news correspondent and manager of the Investigative Reporting Project for

lies about the Notre Dame fire In it she alleges without regard to the political position of the commentator or the real meaning of their words that just as the first flames were licking the roof of Notre Dame conservative writers set about to pushing conspiracy theories on how the fire started apparently in the hopes of inciting violence against Muslims Its not immediately clear how Lavin came to her conclusions  though she does draw Beautiful Mindesque connections between all manner of conservatives  but she does know it seems that writers and commentators share an affinity for dark conclusions and that Ben Shapiro whom she refers to as a fasttalking farright pundit is among the leaders of the movement Shapiro she claims blew a dogwhistle for antiMuslim violence when he commented that Notre Dame was a monument to Western civilization and JudeoChristian heritage To drive her point home she juxtaposed Shapiro with Richard Spencer perhaps the best known American neoNazi as if Shapiro had anything to do with Spencer whom Shapiro has repeatedly and vociferously condemned Lavins claims are downright bizarre Notre Dame is indeed a monument to the civilization  the Western civilization  that built it over the course of several hundred years It is not simply a work of art and architecture but a monument to Christianity and specifically Catholicism It is a place of worship that houses one of Frances largest collection of holy relics and religiouslyinspired art and sculpture As for the term JudeoChristian Lavin who prides herself on her knowledge of white supremacist terminology an accolade she of course bestowed on herself believes Shapiro means to deliberately exclude Islam from the equation putting Muslims on the outside of the culture that built Notre Dame But the term JudeoChristian means nothing of the sort it refers directly to the ongoing interconnected history of Judaism and Christianity which share not just a common ancestry but an ethics and values system that specifically incorporates the natural law as defined in the first several books of the Bible Notre Dame being a church again is a product of JudeoChristian culture and heritage Shapiro quickly shot back at Lavins spurious accusations This from chickinkiev in The Washington Post is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls I blamed no one for the Notre Dame fire since it was an accident by all available evidence and imputing malicious intent to me is simply gross he tweeted This from chickinkiev in The Washington Post is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls I blamed

stop there She has thoughts it seems on how to solve this problem of inciting violence through speech deplatform anyone she finds objectionable including Shapiro It should not take the imprecations of journalists to restrain this dangerous flow of misinformation she writes It is past time that those who stoke inflammatory rhetoric knowing its potential to catalyze racist violence were made to stop playing with fire  before its too late to control the inferno Lavin has experience with stoking inflammatory rhetoric and imputing malicious intent She the expert on farright extremists is perhaps most famous for turning all of leftleaning Twitter against an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement analyst  and veteran of the war in Afghanistan who lost two legs to an IED attack  whom she misidentified as a neoNazi based on an elbow tattoo she thought was a Nazi Iron Cross It was not an Iron Cross It was a simple cross  the symbol of his Marine platoon in Afghanistan She and her thenemployer The New Yorker promptly parted ways She was picked up a month later as a researcher on farright extremism for the leftleaning media watchdog site Media Matters She has since left that job as well and will instead be teaching  what else  how to identify and research members of the far right to the next generation of ideological journalists as a guest instructor at New York University,1

allowed Talia Lavin a guest instructor at New York Universitys journalism program to scurrilously tar and feather Daily Wire EditorinChief Ben Shapiro over his alleged imaginary stoking of racial flames against Muslims in the aftermath of the horrific burning of Paris iconic Notre Dame Cathedral As Zanotti reported Lavin a guest instructor for New York Universitys journalism program made her ridiculous claims in the storied Washington Post which published her oped entitled How the far right spread politically convenient lies about the Notre Dame fire In it she alleges without regard to

the best known American neoNazi as if Shapiro had anything to do with Spencer whom Shapiro has repeatedly and vociferously condemned Comparing Shapiro to Spencer is about as true a sign of being an utterly insipid dunderhead as one could possibly concoct Spencer is a notorious altright Jewhating provocateur and Shapiro was the single most targeted journalist during the 2016 election precisely due in part to his consistently staunch criticisms of the antiSemitic altright This from Talia Lavin in The Washington Post is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls Shapiro tweeted I blamed no one for

garbage smear organization as a media watchdog in every objective news article I very much look forward to the media continuing to quote this garbage smear organization as a media watchdog in every objective news article pictwittercomsbbRzGJWFH  Ben Shapiro benshapiro April 16 2019 Shapiro is no stranger to MMFA having written a Daily Wire piece just last month entitled Media Matters Makes America A Worse Place One Bad Faith Hit At A Time This was from the first an obvious political hit Media Matters contrary to media descriptions isnt a media watchdog organization It is a political smear factory designed to perform precisely that function against anyone to the right of Hillary Clinton The organization was founded by professional smear artist David Brock in conjunction with the Center for American Progress an organization itself founded by John Podesta the Clinton White House Chief of Staff Hillary Clinton herself advised Brock on the creation of the organization Megadonor Leftist George Soros has poured money into the organization announcing in 2010 Media Matters is one of the few groups that attempts to hold Fox News accountable for the false and misleading information they so often broadcast I am supporting Media Matters in an effort to more widely publicize the challenge Fox News poses to civil and informed discourse in our democracy Media Matters had regular strategy calls with the Obama White House For years Media Matters has operated as an aggressive wing of Clintonworld going so far as to suggest hiring private investigators to dig up dirt on Fox News hosts Media Matters consistently attempts to tear down conservative hosts by either ripping them out of context or by digging up old Bad Things then astroturfing public pressure against advertisers In reality no real grassroots pressure exists in the vast majority of cases the data show that secondary boycotts actually dont materialize But Media Matters simply contacts its list of activists then has them contact advertisers saying that theyll stop using a product if that advertiser doesnt pull its advertising A few tweets or wellplaced phone calls can knock an advertiser off a show This last tactic the launching of secondary boycotts has been successfully used against advertisers across a broad range of conservative programming advertisers are understandably risk averse and so take any sign of discontent as a rationale for pulling their money This leads eventually to the complete abandonment of advertisers support on political shows  at least from the right Alas even after MMFA savagely and grotesquely goes after a prominent conservative commentator in defense of an indefensibly defamatory Washington Post screed do not get your hopes up for the mainstream media to start treating MMFA like the leftwing militant aggressor that it is,1
432,Daily Wire,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46044/scientific-american-lets-use-genderless-pronouns-paul-bois,Scientific American has proposed the rather unscientific idea of calling people by genderless pronouns like they and them In an article written last week the publication highlighted a new virtual assistant named Q that has been assigned no gender which should serve as a guideline for how people should now refer to each other from here on out Whereas Siri Alexa and most other electronic helpers speak in conspicuously feminine tones Q has been engineered to create a genderneutral effect says the article As a result users can benefit from all the useful information and guidance available to us today without reinforcing the oldfashioned idea that the role of eager helpmate is necessarily played by a woman The article goes on to note the many cultural shifts already happening that will eventually pave the way to everyone referring to another as a they a them or an it United Airlines recently announced for instance a new booking option that will permit people to say Mx in place of Mr or Mrs Professional settings have also begun business meetings in which people introduce themselves by stating their preferred pronouns LGBTQ leaders and feminists have also put forward the idea of stating preferred pronouns on email signatures However while Scientific American appreciates these gestures of gender inclusion the publication feels it does not go far enough because they leave intact the presumption that gender identity is relevant in all social interactions which the publication claims creates a problem most especially for women Scientific American cites several studies to underline its point such as women with feminine names on their resumes being less likely to earn a job Their solution them and they The universal singular they is inclusive of people who identify as male female or nonbinary eg Drew is in my class they are a great student It avoids the problem of misgendering by not using pronouns to gender people in the first place the article said Plus it reduces the salience of gender in everyday interactions which is likely to be a good thing for women In response to those who would dismiss the proposition as pieinthesky thinking the article dares to argue that the change in pronouns could be the same revolution as the word Ms in the 1960s The problem with that analogy however is that Ms was an outflow of the French terms Madame and Mademoiselle  a woman and a girl It was not so much a revolution as an adoption of what already existed The Scientific American article does not even address how this will be socially enforced which may be through the shame and hectoring of more traditionallyminded people as backwardthinking bigots who wish to oppress women In fact by characterizing the use of traditional pronouns as oppressive Scientific American has already laid the groundwork for that social reality which has already arrived in some quarters Twitter for instance recently updated its hateful conduct policy to include misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals Also the website IMDB was recently heckled by LGBT activists for allowing trans actors birth names to be included in their bios ,0

Richen a professor in the documentary program in the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY She also happens to be a former Democracy Now producer Its great to have you back here Yoruba YORUBA RICHEN Its great to be here always AMY GOODMAN Congratulations on this film YORUBA RICHEN Thank you Thank you AMY GOODMAN Talk about the history and what inspired you to do this film YORUBA RICHEN So lets see Theres so much history within the pages of The Green Book The Green Book was created and first published in 1936 by a man named Victor Hugo Green He was a postal worker based in Harlem And he had the idea for the book because of a Jewish friend of his had a guide for the Catskills for Jewish families where they could go in the Catskills And he looked at that and he said Hey this would be a great idea This is something that the black community needs He also had awas married to a woman named Alma who lived in Virginia and they would travel down to Virginia And he you know experienced all the things that African Americans experienced at that time in terms of traveling And so he created The Green Book AMY GOODMAN You narrate this film I want to take itgo back to the film as you describe and show this history of The Green Book YORUBA RICHEN Victor Green was a postal worker from Harlem New York one of the fastestgrowing AfricanAmerican communities in the country But even in his own neighborhood African Americans were unwelcome at many hotels and other establishments And at Harlems famed nightclubs such as the Cotton Club where top black entertainers like Lena Horne and Duke Ellington packed the house every night blacks were not allowed to sit in the audience In 1936 Green created and published the first Negro Motorist GreenBook which listed businesses where black customers were welcome THE GREEN BOOK 1948 The idea of The Green Book is to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties embarrassments and to make his trips more enjoyable YORUBA RICHEN The Green Book started out only listing locations in New York mainly in Harlem Two of the most prominent were the Hotel Theresa and the YMCA which served as one of Harlems most important recreational and cultural centers During the 1930s dancers from the Cotton Club rehearsed at the YMCA And many famous luminaries such as writer Langston Hughes and boxer Joe Lewis stayed there But The Green Book would soon outgrow Harlem And by the time it ended publication it had become more than just a travel guide It had become a roadmap to some of the most significant people successful businesses and most important political milestones of the 20th century HENRIE MONTEITH TREADWELL Its important to have everyone in this nation examine the significance of The Green Book If you dont see the history if you dont see where it was how can you say it happened YORUBA RICHEN Eventually The Green Book would list more than 9500 places between its pages Today only about a third of those sites are still standing HENRIE MONTEITH TREADWELL We need to find those places and we need to see them and we need to revere what they meant because they made all the difference to our survival THE GREEN BOOK 1947 Carry your Green Book with you You may need it AMY GOODMAN An excerpt of the Smithsonians new documentary The Green Book Guide to Freedom Our guest is Yoruba Richen who is the filmmaker who made this documentary You may need it This was not just about where you could go to have fun this was about where you could go to ensure you would survive YORUBA RICHEN Absolutely absolutely Traveling during that time for African Americans was to say the least a dangerous proposition Not only was there segregation in the South places where African Americans obviously were not allowed to go to eat to sleep but also the North and the West So you know theres this mythology that racism and segregation is confined to the South or was confined to the South Thats not true The North and the West had the majority of what we call sundown towns places where African Americans had to get out had to leave town There were maybe signs a bell might be rung for African Americans to leave the town They were not welcome and there was the potential for violence AMY GOODMAN After midnight In the daytime they could work there YORUBA RICHEN Yes they could work there and then they had to leave AMY GOODMAN In fact that was also referenced in the Hollywood film Green Book YORUBA RICHEN Absolutely yeah AMY GOODMAN Which has been criticized for various reasons YORUBA RICHEN Right AMY GOODMAN the perspective it was told from the white drivers sonit was based on his bookand not consulting Don Shirleys family YORUBA RICHEN Yeah AMY GOODMAN This remarkable pianist classical jazz who took this tour in 1962 through the South But you definitely have the sense of violence he faced And his going towell talk about in the Hollywood film the places he went to versus well all the places that are documented in The Green Book YORUBA RICHEN Yeah I mean that was one of the most frustrating parts for me and for many people watching the Hollywood film is that the film is called The Green BookThe Green Book is only a small part of the filmbut the places that they went to were really not nice places They were AMY GOODMAN Dumps YORUBA RICHEN dumpy Yeah they were dumps And thats not what was in The Green Book Thats not the extent The Green Book had 9500 listings over the period of 30someodd years And you know one of those places was the Gaston Motel the finest motel a Negro motel in the country So that was a real misrepresentation And the other thing AMY GOODMAN In fact we were just in Birmingham this weekend the Gaston Hotel not far from the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and theyre talking about now renovating it YORUBA RICHEN Absolutely AMY GOODMAN and preserving it YORUBA RICHEN Yeah absolutely Its really exciting The other thing the film did was that the driver and Dr Shirley only used the book in the South So when they were in the North and in the West you didnt see them using the book And then when they get to the South is when they use the book And as I said before thats not true I mean these listings were all over because African Americans had to navigate those dangerous roads all over the country AMY GOODMAN Were going to break and when we come back were going to talk about some of these places like Idlewild and also talk about the role of Esso the oil company Yoruba Richen is the writer and director of The Green Book Guide to Freedom which will be premiering on Smithsonian Channel on Monday Stay with us break AMY GOODMAN Ride On Red Ride On by Louisiana Red This is Democracy Now democracynoworg The War and Peace Report Im Amy Goodman Were talking about the new documentary The Green Book Guide to Freedom which will premiere Monday on Smithsonian Channel I want to go to another clip YORUBA RICHEN One black resort in northwest Michigan would become legendary Idlewild MARILYN S TAYLOR My dad was a lawyer in Detroit And he purchased land when I was 7 and built this house So Ive been here since I was 7 years old and now ImIll be 78 This was a place that you were free to bike We were free to swim We were free to just visit with each other and have a wonderful time And we would ride every morning and then come home and have lunch and then go to the beach in the afternoon You met your friends You played cards You swam And you had fun for the afternoon until the 600 whistle And then you had to come home YORUBA RICHEN During its heyday in the 1950s Idlewild was one of the largest resort communities in the Midwest The beating heart of Idlewilds booming night life was the Flamingo Club owned by developer Phil Giles BETTY FOOTE First it was a bar and a patio Then he added the club part Then thats when it became the Flamingo Club And he really put Idlewild on the map It was just nothing but people Nothing but people Senators political peopleeverybody came to Idlewild I was born and reared here Im 81 years old So those were my mentors The ladies were so glamorous and dressed so glamorous and the men were ah to die for This place was so full all the time They would run out of spaces to live you know accommodationsno hotel rooms nothing left They would take their baths in the lake and then change and dress out of their cars But they wasnt gonna leave Idlewild LOIS PERRY Thats right YORUBA RICHEN Worldfamous performers entertained the visitors to the resortamong them Louis Armstrong and Dinah Washington LOIS PERRY They were singing and jamming on the inside I was a waitress Sarah Vaughan was mythat was my lady And I waited on her And when I carried her changeshe had gave me a 100 billshe said Keep the change darlin AMY GOODMAN A clip from The Green Book Guide to Freedom premiering Monday on Smithsonian Channel Idlewild the significance the dignity of it and wherehow it stands today YORUBA RICHEN Im so happy you played that clip Amy Thats one of my favorite parts of the film that we got to show this communityand there were many communities like it all over the countrywhere African Americans developed this community for themselves to have vacation and relax in safety and a safe haven Thats what everybody said when we went up there and filmed AMY GOODMAN And lets be clear This is the North YORUBA RICHEN This is the North This is in northwest Michigan upper Michigan And it wasits such a beautiful place The history is amazing The development started in 1910 by one of the first AfricanAmerican heart surgeons at University of Chicago These people have been there for generations and they have such pride in their community At its heyday as it says in the film there wereat one point it was the biggest resort in the Midwest black or white And today of course its not the heyday that it was but folks are trying to develop the buildings redevelop the buildings encourage people to come back There are events there And as one of the characters one of the subjects says in the film the soil is so rich you know you really feel it when youre there AMY GOODMAN And youre going to be having a showing in Detroit YORUBA RICHEN Thats right We are screening in Detroit on Monday night the night of the broadcast So Im really excited We have somebody from Idlewild whos going to be on our panel Jamon Jordan whos in the clip So its going to be great AMY GOODMAN I wanted to turn to the 1949 edition of The Negro Motorist Green Book On the cover it says Carry your Green Book with youYou may need it And under that is a quote by Mark Twain Travel is fatal to prejudice Inside on page three just after the introduction is a column by Wendell P Alston a special representative of the Esso Standard Oil Company titled The Green Book helps solve your travel problems Alston writes quote The Negro travelers inconveniences are many and they are increasing because today so many more are traveling individually and in groups On the next page is a picture of Alston along with James A Jackson with the caption Special representatives of the Esso  marketers in their New York office Talk about the role of Esso and these two AfricanAmerican men in The Green Book YORUBA RICHEN Absolutely That was one of the most interesting discoveries that we had in making this film Esso gas station which was Standard Oil owned by Standard Oil which was owned by Rockefeller had a very early program to promote to African Americans and not only that but to hire AfricanAmerican scientists and chemists He was married to a woman named Spelman Her last name was Spelman They come from a long line of abolitionists Spelman College the HBCU in Atlanta was created by their family So there was a history of this corporate behemoth working with the AfricanAmerican community And they distributed The Green Book at their Esso gas stations And that is howone of the ways that The Green Book was able to be so widely distributed and so popular AMY GOODMAN You also talk about the women entrepreneurs YORUBA RICHEN Absolutely You know the womenthe stories that we were finding and that we were coming upon so many of them were womenowned businesses And at one point I start looking through the pages of The Green Book Theyre all online the Schomburg has them all online so anybody can look and look up their town to see whats listed But there are all these pictures of women owners of women business owners They had sent in their pictures They were advertising in it And you know everything from restaurants and motels and hotels So black women entrepreneurship is something that is a part of our experience and a part of our history AMY GOODMAN Are you astoundedin these last 30 secondsthat you had heard nothing about The Green Book when you were asked to do this documentary YORUBA RICHEN It was divine timing I mean no its amazing What I am also very excited about is that the fiction film has given visibility to this piece And hopefully people willyou know their interest will be piqued by the fiction film no matter what happens on Sunday night and then they will come and watch this documentary AMY GOODMAN So the Oscars Sunday night and your film The Green Book Guide to Freedom will premiere on Monday night on Smithsonian Channel Yoruba Richen director and writer and of The Green

citizenship with the exception of children of diplomats as they dont fall under US jurisdiction Muthanas attorneys insist she does hold US citizenship She was born in Hackensack New Jersey October 28th 1994 after her father had relinquished his diplomatic status more than a month before The United States issued her a passport in 2005 renewed it in 2014 But in 2016 the Obama administration sent her a letter saying her passport was no longer valid On Thursday Muthanas family filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to allow her and her son to come back to the US To find out more about the implications of Hodas case we go to Dallas Texas to speak with Charlie Swift the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America an attorney for Hoda Muthanas father Swift is a retired Navy officer who retired in 2007 as a lieutenant commander in the JAG Corpsthats the Judge Advocate Generals Corps He is best known for winning the US Supreme Court case Hamdan v Rumsfeld for his client Guantánamo prisoner Salim Ahmed Hamdan Charlie Swift welcome to Democracy Now Explain the case of Hoda Muthana Is she a US citizen CHARLES SWIFT Well first thank you for having me And second yes she is Youve hit on the pertinent facts The 14th Amendment gives anyone born in the United States or naturalized who are subject to jurisdiction of the courts citizenship Now subject to jurisdiction was a phrase that was used for diplomats In other words diplomats who have diplomatic immunity are not subject to the jurisdiction of US courts However Hoda Muthanas father was discharged from that position And diplomatic immunity isnt personal It follows theit is part of the position you hold If youre a diplomat in a foreign country you have it by virtue of the position that you hold having been recognized by that country or in this country by the United States In Hoda Muthanas case Ali Muthana her father had been discharged on 1 September And she wasnt born until the 23rd of October And I want you to think about it this way if you have any question Lets say instead of Hoda Muthana being born on October 23rd Ali Muthana had walked into a convenience store held it up and shot the clerksomething hed never do hes an incredibly lawabiding citizen But for purposes of this lets use that hypothetical Now lets seriously consider Hes out of his position Hes been discharged for morealmost 53 days Are we going to say he has diplomatic immunity Not a chance Its not a close question The courts have looked at this Hed have a reasonable period of time to leave the country but if he hadwhich is generally defined as 30 days but he hadnt left the country didnt have any intent to leave the country Hes now subject to the jurisdiction of the courts and therefore his daughter his family is subject to jurisdiction of the courts and she is a citizen And everybody thought she was a citizen She was issued not one but two passports The State Department recognized that he had beenthat Ali Muthana had been discharged It wasnt until after she made an incredibly bad decision one that her family has urged her against from the beginningthey didnt know she was leaving but they have cooperated with authorities to try and get her back since she leftthat this even came up So if you look at the facts you look at the text of the Constitution what you have here is simply ignoring the Constitution ignoring the steps on it AMY GOODMAN And what are the implications of this How could this expand Explain what could happen in other cases if someones outside the country Does this mean at this point since theyve pulled her passport she cannot return to the United States CHARLES SWIFT It does mean that She doesnt have the ability to travel So one of the reasons were going to court is to get theis to seek the court to aid her in her return The Supreme Court said that any US citizen has the right to reenter Thats an absolute And citizenship can only be lost under very limited circumstances and its always a judicial matter It cant be done by the executive simply saying Youre not a citizen anymore And the implications are tremendous First part if youre comfortable with whats happened to her imagine another US citizen is outside the country saying and doing things that the United States doesnt like so they to say You know what We dont believe her birth certificate or his birth certificate We question it Were sending you a letter saying I dont think your birth certificate was valid youre revoked you cant come back And by the way you cant come to a court here because your passport has been revoked You cant come back into the United States Weve closed the door The implications are significant And in fact weve been hearing at the center about these very same letters being used for persons who were born in the United States to midwives but were now revoking their citizenship by letter AMY GOODMAN I want to go back to Hoda Muthana speaking to ABCs James Longman earlier this month JAMES LONGMAN Do you feel shame when you hear that back HODA MUTHANA Very much yeah JAMES LONGMAN What you think would be a kind of a normal thing HODA MUTHANA Maybe therapy lessons Maybe a process that will ensure us that well never do this again Jail time I dont know if that has an effect on people JAMES LONGMAN I dont know if youve quite grasped how awful ISIS was to the communities the Yazidi women that were enslaved the men and women who were accused of being homosexual who were pushed off buildings Do you feel regret and sorrow and remorse for being part of an organization like ISIS HODA MUTHANA Definitely Its not Islamic at all I believe that 100 percent AMY GOODMAN So thats Hoda Muthana speaking on ABC CHARLES SWIFT Yes AMY GOODMAN Charles Swift talk about her story Talk about why Hoda left this country about her wanting to join ISIS going to Syria marrying three different ISIS fighters as they died having this son Why did she join ISIS CHARLES SWIFT You know I dont have an answer to that Her parents dont have an answer to that in the process in it For me the issues here are constitutionalthe revocation of citizenship which the Supreme Court has said is never a valid punishment So I look at that part I think its noteworthy though Hoda Muthana may hope that she doesnt get punished or get jail time Ive been a criminal defense attorney for most of my life as well as working on civil rights and all of my clients hope they wont go to jail I would say though that one of the things that shes doing by pursuing to come back here is making herself eligible to go to jail She puts herself inby filing the suit the defense to her actionsthe best defense on going over is that she wasnt a US citizen Almost all the statutes under whichI think all of the statutes under which she could be charged all require for extraterritoriality that the crime either originate in the United States or that she be a US citizen And since the crime didnt occur til she got over there and if shes not a US citizen there would be no jurisdiction to try her for the criminal offenses By establishing her citizenship she actually makes herself eligible for trial and punishment somethingyou know her parents are fully aware of that Her father is fully aware of it And he thinks that she should face justice And if shes convicted of something she should serve the time for it But he also believes that his grandson and she are still citizens and should be able to return AMY GOODMAN I wanted to read one of her inflammatory tweets when she was in Syria She wrote Americans wake up Men and women altogether You have much to do while you live under our greatest enemy enough of your sleeping Go on drivebys and spill all of their blood or rent a big truck and drive all over them Veterans Patriot Memorial etc Day  Kill them CHARLES SWIFT Yep And a question is whether thats criminal or not But my concern is if you strip your citizenship for it See theres a very strong idea this isthat plays in over time that if youre disloyal to the country then you should lose your citizenship Thats how the British approach it Its not how the United States approaches it because weve had this absolute belief in free speech Speech can become criminal You can be punished for it But weve never stripped citizenship So Id like to change that a little What if the administration later on says that anyone who does not support the current administration is creating treason that their speech is hurting America and were going to strip you of citizenship for it The 14th Amendment is absolute If youre going to strip somebody based on their words wheres your line Amy Wheres your line AMY GOODMAN Well lets turn CHARLES SWIFT See this issues herethis is the problem The issues are always bigger than the person The issues werent Mirandas guilt The issues here are the constitutionalour constitutional foundations And how we treat Hoda Muthana says a great deal about who we are as a nation We dont strip citizenship No one at least in her family and whatnot is saying it doesnt deserve criminal prosecution And I think were conflating the two as somehow she comes back and doesnt get prosecuted She may hope that shes not prosecuted Again I have yet to meet a criminal defendant who was extraordinarily excited about that prospect But in choosing to return she chooses prosecution AMY GOODMAN Well Id like to turn to Hoda Muthana again responding to Mike Pompeos claim that shes not a US citizen She was interviewed in Syria by NBCs Richard Engel HODA MUTHANA I read the papers and I know in fact that I was a citizen And when I tried filing for a passport it was very easy It came in 10 days So I thought I didnt have a problem And Im sure theres no problem And I know my lawyer hopefully is working on it and he will win the case RICHARD ENGEL Do you think youll be able to go back to the United States Do you want to go to the United States HODA MUTHANA Id prefer America other than anywhere else yeah RICHARD ENGEL And what do youwhat do you want to do if you went back to the States What do you think will happen to you if you were allowed to go back HODA MUTHANA Of course Ill be given jail time AMY GOODMAN So thats Hoda Muthana who is saying she does expect she would be given jail time CHARLES SWIFT Yeah yeah I would think its very important to separate hopes and expectations in this process Amy is thatyou know as I said everybody hopes that theyre not going to go to jail for very long Her expectation is that she will go to jail And the reason among all things both the family and for Hoda is the 18monthold son who is a US citizen by virtue of birth to her Hoda has used the words to her family that she has ruined her life she doesnt want to ruin his AMY GOODMAN Shamima Begum is in a similar situation Her citizenship was revoked by the UK She fled to Syria from London when she was 15 Your response to the two CHARLES SWIFT Well shes in a similar situation until we get to what country shes fromthe British and the Americans Now Im very veryI like the British but Im very proud to be an American And at the time of our founding and afterwards we put in place a Constitution because of the very types of abuses that we thought were wrong in Britain Britain threw around the word treason too easily It stripped citizenship It banished people Thats what it did That was part of its governments system The Founding Fathers of the United States were having none of that We set up a constitutional republic under the Constitution We dont swear allegiance to a queen We swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States of America And the Constitution here is clear The Constitution is not for bright sunny days Its for rainy ones Its for the unpopular The popular dont need it AMY GOODMAN Well Charlie Swift we want to thank you for being with us the attorney for Hoda Muthanas family He is the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America CHARLES SWIFT Thank you AMY GOODMAN He happens to be speaking to us today from Dallas Texas This is Democracy Now When we come back Life and Death

Digest today Dont worry well never share or sell your information The former chief medical officer of New York City jails has just published a remarkable new book about the health risks of incarceration The book is titled Life and Death in Rikers Island Dr Homer Venters offers unprecedented insight into what happens inside prison walls to create new health risks for incarcerated men and women including neglect blocked access to care physical and sexual violence and brutality by corrections officers Venters further reveals that when prisoners become ill are injured or even die in custody the facts of the incident are often obscured We speak to Dr Venters and Jennifer Gonnerman staff writer for The New Yorker magazine AMY GOODMAN This is Democracy Now Im Amy Goodman His name is synonymous with all thats wrong with the prison system Kalief Browder Kalief spent three years at Rikers Island jail in New York without charge He was a 16yearold high school sophomore when he was detained on suspicion of stealing a backpack Browder never pleaded guilty was never convicted He maintained his innocence and requested a trial but was only offered plea deals while the trial was repeatedly delayed He was held at Rikers Island jail for three years beaten by guards and prisoners alike After enduring nearly 800 days in solitary confinement and abuses Browder was only released when the case was dismissed He committed suicide on June 6 2015 at his home in the Bronx He was 22 years old Nearly four years later the question remains Why did Kalief have to die Is there something inherently wrong with incarceration that makes it a health risk sometimes with deadly consequences Well a remarkable new book attempts to answer those questions as it shines a light on the health risks of imprisonment The book is titled Life and Death in Rikers Island Its author Dr Homer Venters the former chief medical officer of New York City jails He offers unprecedented insight into what happens inside prison walls to create new health risks for incarcerated men and women including neglect blocked access to care physical and sexual violence and brutality by corrections officers Venters further reveals that when prisoners become ill or injured or even die in custody the facts of the incident are often obscured He writes quote We work in settings that are designed and operated to keep the truth hidden Detainees are beaten and threatened to prevent them from telling the truth about how they are injured health staff are pressured to lie or omit details in their own documentation and families experience systematic abuse and humiliation during the visitation process unquote The risks of jail are disproportionately harmful for people with behavioral health problems and for people of color Venters explains He concludes Rikers Island must close and suggests how that should be done Well Dr Homer Venters joins us now physician and former chief medical officer for New York Citys Correctional Health Services Again his book Life and Death in Rikers Island Hes currently senior health and justice fellow at Community Oriented Correctional Health Services and associate professor at New York Universitys College of Global Public Health Also with us Jennifer Gonnerman staff writer for The New Yorker magazine Her most recent piece is a review of Dr Venters book Its called Life and Death in Rikers Island Do Jails Kill People is the name of her article Welcome you both to Democracy Now OK Dr Venters start off talking about why you wrote this book and how Kalief Browders death relates to all of this DR HOMER VENTERS Well early on in my time overseeing the health system in the New York City jails it became clear that our job was not just to take care of people who were injured or address the medical problems people had but that this system was conferring new health risks to our patients So our patients were getting hurt because of the way the jails were set up and run And so it was clear to my team and I that part of our mission had to be to use our tools as public health and epidemiology folks as well as doctors and nurses to document just what these health risks were and to report those out And one of the things that over the years became clear is that those health risks as you just stated arent meted out in a uniform fashion People with behavioral health problems people of color our data show were more likely to find themselves on the wrong end of these health risks AMY GOODMAN Talk about why prisons are lethal Talk about Rikers Island for example DR HOMER VENTERS Well we can start with the first and most serious health risk which is death Its clear that there are many preventable or what we would call jailattributable deaths that happen We worked hard to document those while I was leading the health service in the New York City jails but there are many others So for instance people that we know who are coming in with very serious health problemsdiabetes or hepatitis C or needing dialysiswho then are denied those services despite the fact that we have them available people who are exposed to solitary confinement not just the isolation but the brutality and violence associated with it who do take extreme measures to get away from the distress that that setting causesthose are things that were conferred to those people AMY GOODMAN Tell us the story of Carlos Mercado and Angel Ramirez DR HOMER VENTERS So those are two patients who as have been publicly reported entered into the jail system with clearly identified health problems one with diabetes and one undergoing withdrawal And as has been reported in the press they both despite having clearly communicated their problems and even having their problems elicited and understood by quite a few people in the jails received a punishment response and a neglect response that led to their death even though they were in a system that was able to provide them the healthcare they needed AMY GOODMAN So what happens to a prisoner when theyre sick You also talk about the tension between the doctors the nursesthe health professionalsand the guards DR HOMER VENTERS In the best of circumstances the correctional officers who are with our patients all the timeyou know they see and interact with people much more than we do in the health servicethey determine that somebody is ill and they need help or somebody just reports I dont feel well then theyre taken to medical care and they get the appropriate level of medical care Theyre transferred to the hospital if they need something that the jails cant provide In the worst circumstanceand there are some situations that actually hardwire in this less ideal responsepeople arent able to say that theyre sick or that they feel well or when they do theyre not believed and so theyre kept in a chaotic intake pen or theyre kept in a solitary confinement cell even though theyre saying clearly I need insulin or Im sick or Ive just swallowed something that could kill me and then theyre denied access to healthcare And then finally I would say that because of the pressure of dual loyalty this really crushing and very omnipresent ethical problem human rights problem in correctional health that even when they do make it to the health service sometimes the doctor or nurse or social worker in front of them is acting more as an agent of the security service than as a healthcare provider AMY GOODMAN Talk about your own experiences You entered the jails in what 2008 DR HOMER VENTERS Yes AMY GOODMAN About a decade ago DR HOMER VENTERS Yes AMY GOODMAN What did you find there What shocked you most DR HOMER VENTERS I believe that whatone of the things that shocked me the most was the high level of injury and injury associated with violence Certainly all physicians and healthcare people we have experience taking care of injuries But so many of our patients were coming to us with injuries and so many of them were saying that these injuries were from things called slip and falls So you know patients that come with a fracture to the jaw a veryyou know very serious injury or a fracture of the upper arm or the leg and then saying that they had slipped and fallenthings that just did notyou know we didnt believe But also it was clear when you interacted with these patients that they were terrified and that they actually in that moment were thinking very clearly about their survival and their preservation And so it makes a very difficult proposition for a doctor or nurse AMY GOODMAN So you set up an injury surveillance system DR HOMER VENTERS Thats right Shortly before I arrived Christopher Robinson another young man who died in that same jail that Kalief Browder was held in he had been beaten to death And so when I did arrive and started with the Correctional Health Service we set about understanding how many other people were injured especially adolescents And we saw lots of jaw fractures and hand fractures And so at first we were dealing with paper records but then we quickly implemented in the New York City jail system an electronic medical record But we were able to modify that in really major ways so that we could capture data not just about the type of injury people had but about whether or not it was intentional Did it happen during a use of force Was there a blow to the head Then we could use that data to report out to others not just in the correctional service or the city but outside parties that might be interested what the rates of injury were so that we had empirical data to show that brutality and injury was in fact a real crisis for our patients AMY GOODMAN Describe what would happen when you would send an email to the DOC to the Department of Corrections to upgrade an injury to upgrade what you saw DR HOMER VENTERS Well the injury reporting system on the health side as I mentioned we built a pretty sophisticated electronic medical record system On the security side it required paper pieces of paper injury reports to be updated and amended actually on an individual piece of paper So when I would find a patient as I often would who had an injury that was more serious than initially reported or that the circumstances of the injury were different than was originally reported unlike in healthcare where we want all information to lead us to the quickest best outcome for the patient these paper forms then would be put back in my face and people would say Listen you have to find the original doctor or go to the original jail Go find this piece of paperthat nobody can find Thats the proper way to get this addressed not simply to tell us that just because youre a doctor or a health administrator you think something else happened AMY GOODMAN Why is there so little transparency Talk about the silent complicity you describe DR HOMER VENTERS You know these are paramilitary settings And so the health service in most of these places even when we have an independent health authority we still rely on the correctional staff for our safety and security And so as such because there isnt a lot of mandated transparency about health outcomes about the true characteristics of injuries for instance at the time we were doing this work most of the system is designed to keep information on the inside so that anybody who wants to change the original account whether its a patient or a doctor or a nurse faces a real gauntlet of challenges that not only are bureaucratic and administrative but actually could put their own personal safety at risk AMY GOODMAN Were going to break and then come back to this discussion and bring in Jennifer Gonnerman who wrote the review of your piece for The New Yorkerthe review of your book Dr Homer Venters book is called Life and Death in Rikers Island Stay with us break AMY GOODMAN Blue Prelude by Ethel Ennis Baltimores First Lady of Jazz She passed away February 17th at the age of 86 This is Democracy Now democracynoworg The War and Peace Report I want to turn to Kalief Browder in his own words Kalief Browder of course is thewell was 16 when he was arrested and sent to Rikers Island He ended up being there for three years much of that time in solitary confinement without charge He was arrested when he was a high school sophomore Police believedthey said that he stole a backpack but could never come up with the person who made the accusation who they drove around a neighbor and the person pointed out Kalief walking on the street And then that person just disappeared Kalief would not plead in prison because he said he was taught not to lie and he said he was innocent Held for three years much of that time in solitary confinement He said that while he was in solitary confinement at Rikers the guards often refused to give him his meals KALIEF BROWDER If you say anything that could tick them off any type of way some of them which is a lot of them what they do is they starve you They wont feed you And its already hard in there because if you get the three trays that you get every day youre still hungry because I guess thats part of the punishment So if they starve you one tray that could really make an impact on you And MARC LAMONT HILL How much were you starved KALIEF BROWDER I was starved a lot I cant evenI cant even count AMY GOODMAN So that was Kalief Browder speaking on HuffPost Live when it was around He died within two years after this interview He took his own life He went on to say he was once starved four times in a rowno breakfast lunch dinner or breakfast again After enduring nearly 800 days in solitary Browder was only released when the case was dismissed Browder took his own life June 6 2015 at his home in the Bronx He was 22 years old He was a student at Bronx Community College Jennifer Gonnerman wrote a lot about his case for The New Yorker and exposed videos that were gotten from the inside of Rikers showing him being beaten by guards and prisoners alike Jennifer you have covered the prison system a lot And you were really taken with this book Life and Death in Rikers Island and wrote a review of it for The New Yorker JENNIFER GONNERMAN Yeah you know I saw an early copy of this book in December And a lot of books come in You know as a reporter you get a lot ofoften get a lot of books and people who want publicity I started reading this book and I really couldnt put it down I thought it was so important crucially important And I feel like it covers one of the most overlooked aspects of mass incarceration I mean mass incarceration has gotten a lot of attention in recent years But whatthe health risks that folks endure when they go inside is something that I feel needs much more attention And I think as a society weve sort of grown numb to these headlines like an individual died in prison or jail and we dont really follow up with the necessary questions And what Dr Venters book does is really pushes us to ask those harder questions like Did this death have to happen Was it preventable Did something happen in the jail that led to this individuals death And those are the kind of questions the publicand journalists in particularreally need to be asking AMY GOODMAN Tell us the case of Ronald Spear JENNIFER GONNERMAN Ronald Spear is one of the gentlemen in the book He was in Rikers Island He was in his fifties He was a kidney dialysis patient In 2012 one night he felt very ill and tried to get the attention of the doctor He was housed in the infirmary on Rikers Island There was a medical office next door to his dorm He snuck out of the dorm to get into the hall to get to the medical office and the doctor told himyou know a guard stopped him and the doctor said You have to keep waiting He had been waiting for hours The officer the correction officer and Mr Spear got into an altercation which ended with two other guards coming in and restraining him on the floor And that would have been the end of the situation but then the first officer whose name is Brian Coll came in and kicked Mr Spear in the head repeatedly and he died right there on the floor This case was covered up lied about for years until finally federal prosecutors in the Southern District in Manhattan brought a prosecution against the officer And he went on trial in 2016 So I sat through the trial And obviously the focus was on what this officer did and didnt do But one of the subtexts of that court case was what the medical staff was doing at the time So this crime took place in the hallway right outside the medical offices and the nurse got on the stand and said when she heard the altercation in the hallway she opened her door and then she shut her door and that she had sort of been taught to do that Its almost like an unofficial rule on Rikers Island And the doctor who was on duty and hears all of this commotion going on in the hallway he was sitting in his office and never looked out the window never opened the door testified to all of this and only opened his door after the whole thing was over and somebody knocked on the doorI believe it was a captainand said Can you come out here and you know help And at that point Mr Spear is on the floor in handcuffs face down and no pulse And so essentially this homicide took place within feet of the medical staff And that always stuck with me And you know this idea of an unofficial rule of averting your eyes when theres an altercation between correction officers and inmates is something that actually shows up in Dr Venters book also AMY GOODMAN You say that 112 people died in New York City jails between 2010 and 2016 Thats like almost what Twenty a year JENNIFER GONNERMAN More probably in some years right Yeah DR HOMER VENTERS Some years yes AMY GOODMAN So what is societys responsibility here DR HOMER VENTERS I think that there are really very large policy decisions that have been made to keep these deaths and injuries hidden And so to undo these problems is not simply a matter of a little bit of training for one group of staff or another It is that we have to establish medical systems that work not only to care for the patients and their health problems but also to collect the data we do in the rest of the country and report it out We also need independent oversight Were fortunate in New York City to have the Board of Correction an incredibly vital institution that really doesnt exist in most of the other 3000 counties in the States But they need to be supported and the independence to make sure that the health service and the correctional service adhere to rules AMY GOODMAN Dr Venters you also say Rikers should be closed DR HOMER VENTERS Absolutely AMY GOODMAN Is it happening fast enough DR HOMER VENTERS Well so the Mayors Office of Criminal Justice led by Liz Glazer is doing an amazing amount of work to come up with the actual planning that can make it happen But this is a political question To close Rikers Island one of the AMY GOODMAN How many people does it imprison DR HOMER VENTERS The jail system today has abouthas under 9000 But we really need to get down to 5000 or so which means building at least another borough jail AMY GOODMAN You write the health risks that are faced particularly by people with behavioral problems in prisontalk about that DR HOMER VENTERS Yeah I think that the most extreme example thats really an obscenity is the notion that people who exhibit symptoms of mental health problems would be then put into solitary confinement where we know that theyll get worse and often die And so the idea that we had a solitary confinement unit for people with mental illness in the New York City jails until 2014 is horrific Its notthats not a lack of resources Thats not a lack of thought Thought went into it And so where Jason Echevarria and others died you know that was an affirmative decision So undoing those bad decisions coming up with a more clinically appropriate a therapeutic model in most cases means not having people in jail It means having people in a community setting thats an actual healthcare setting We built alternative models in the New York City jails these units the CAPS and PACE units these very therapeutic units but theyre incredibly expensivecouple million dollars a year for 20 patients And every aspect of those units would be more effective if they were not in the jails AMY GOODMAN Mass incarceration in this country has been taken on by grassroots activists now for years And its certainly reading I think areaching a tipping point where you have people across the political spectrum saying we have the largest prison population in the world How can this be changed DR HOMER VENTERS I think that one oftheres an important voice that needs to be brought to this which is healthcare systems health insurance companies because keep in mind that while most people dont die in jail or prison many people are coming home with physical and psychological damage from these settings And the care they needwhich they may have struggle to access but the care they need is going to be provided by community hospitals Just take the example of traumatic brain injury We documented all of the hidden traumatic brain injury just in the New York City jail systems That increases the risk of those people for dementia and CTE down the road that is incredibly costly to them and their families AMY GOODMAN How do people on the outside get access to this information on the inside particularly families of people who are in prison DR HOMER VENTERS So I think that it isthese systems are designed to keep the truth fromcertainly from families who are you know lied to all the time And frombut I think that its incredibly important to have aggressive journalism But also I think that some of the structures that exist in New York City should be replicated elsewhere so having a board of correction or an oversight agency that demands data Having investigative journalists that dig into individual deaths is incredibly important AMY GOODMAN Steve Coll just wrote a new piece in The New Yorker The Jail HealthCare Crisis talking about the opioid epidemic among other things DR HOMER VENTERS Yeah I think that thats athat is also a very good example that most jails and prisons people dont have access to evidencebased addiction care So many people end up incarcerated because of an addiction problem Then because theyre denied access to buprenorphine and methadone they leave and we knowwe have documented here in New York Citytheir risk of death when they leave is much higher Now in New York City we have a methadone program and a buprenorphine program for people who are incarcerated but very few jails around the country have that AMY GOODMAN And Jennifer Gonnerman what gives you the most hope as you continue to cover the prisonindustrial complex JENNIFER GONNERMAN Well you know as you were mentioning theres a lot of activists that have taken up this cause which is fantastic because you know back in the 90s the 2000s you just didnt see that level of interest or enthusiasm in activism for taking on these really challenging topics That gives me hope And also folks like Dr Venters people who have been on the inside who have witnessed horrific things and then have the wherewithal and the courage and take the time to really record them so the rest of us can really truly get a much better understanding of whats going on behind bars AMY GOODMAN And the access to information you as a journalist have gettingfor example you leaked these videos of what was taking place with Kalief being beaten the videos that are taken the surveillance system within prison JENNIFER GONNERMAN Right You know that was very unusual You know there is very little video footage that has come out offrom prisons around the country despite there being a number of surveillance cameras You know like Dr Venters said the truth is hidden Its intentionally hidden Its very difficultyou know reporting on whats going on inside of jails and prisons is very difficult But obviously the more journalists who are taking on the challenge the more were going to get to the heart of what the truth is AMY GOODMAN I want to thank you both for being with us Dr Homer Venters former chief medical officer for New York Citys Correctional Health Services His new book Life and Death in Rikers Island And Jennifer Gonnerman staff writer for The New Yorker magazine Well link to her piece Do
