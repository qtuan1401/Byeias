.@TuckerCarlson: Bernie Sanders revealed himself as a ”puppet of people in power. ”https:  .  Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Daily Caller editor and network regular Tucker Carlson reacted to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ ( ) speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia a night earlier.  Sanders, formerly a candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, urged his supporters to get behind his former opponent presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. According to Carlson, that shows Sanders was a “puppet of people in power. ” “A lot of them are sincere ideologues who I disagree with, but respect for their sincerity  —   Bernie Sanders not among them,” Carlson said. “Bernie Sanders turned out to not be a revolutionary but an obedient little party guy that does what he’s told. How sad is that?” “I think he betrayed the ideals of the people who supported him,” he added. “And I think he revealed himself again, not as a free thinker or someone who is bigger than politics, but someone who is just a puppet of people in power. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
