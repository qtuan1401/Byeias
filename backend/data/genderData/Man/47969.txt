’  ’ ”   Tesla has always insisted that it doesn’t have any demand   problems. Rather, it has production problems. ” ’   And evidently, those production problems became severe this year.   After the car maker released   earnings on   Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk took analysts questions and revealed how   many issues Tesla had with   2016 manufacturing: ’ ’   ”We were in production hell,” he said. ”We climbed out of hell in   June.” ’ ’   He added that he’’s ”not losing sleep at night because of   production issues” anymore, but that he has ”a whole lot of   mental scar tissue from earlier this year.” ’ ”   He included some insight into the changes that will necessary at   Tesla’s California factory to achieve   of the   forthcoming Model 3, which will sell for $35, 000 and hit the road   in 2017. ” ’’ ’   Musk said that the   term they have for the manufacturing   advancement he hopes to introduce is ”alien dreadnought.” ’ ’   ”The point at which that’s what the factory looks like, that’’s   when you know you’ve won.” ’ ’   Musk then outlined, using software terminology, the evolution of   the factory, from version o. 5 to version 3. 0 ’ ’   ”By version 3, it won’t look like anything else,” he said. ”You   can’t have people in the production line itself, otherwise you   drop to people speed. So there will be no people in production   process itself. People will maintain the machines,   upgrade them, and deal with anomalies.” ’ ’   This idea has been talked about in the auto industry and the   wider world of manufacturing for some time. But Musk seems to be   aiming for full automation of the Model 3 build process. ’
