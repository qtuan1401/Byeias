Speaking at Tuesday’s Memorial for the fallen Dallas Police officers, President Obama suggested it is easier ‘to buy a Glock” than a book in many communities. [He suggested that police relations with minority communities are in tatters because “we flood communities with so many guns, it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than [to] get his hands on a computer or even a book. ” Yet we tell the police “to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs,” he said. Obama added that we then “feign surprise when the tensions boil over. ”  Obama said we all know this to be true but “we cannot even talk about these things. ” He said we will not make progress until we can talk. On July 9, Obama sounded a similar theme while speaking in Warsaw, Poland.  He criticized gun laws in Texas, tied police safety to more gun control, and said Americans need to come together and talk about guns. He said, “There is a way to talk  …    that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. ” He then pledged that he will not cease talking about gun control.
