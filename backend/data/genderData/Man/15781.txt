Hillary Clinton will attend at least four fundraisers in California this Thursday and Friday, marking her sixth tour to the Golden State since officially declaring her candidacy last spring. [The Democratic presidential frontrunner will participate in events in Southern California on Thursday before heading to the Bay Area to add more ammo to her war chest. According to the Contra Costa Times, she will attend a $   luncheon on Thursday in the San Gabriel Valley with Rep. Judy Chu (  Park) who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, followed by a “family celebration” reception that same afternoon at the Jim Henson Studios in Los Angeles.  Clinton will also make an attempt to sway   voters —  who the Times points out have emerged as a major voting bloc in battleground swing states such as Nevada, Virginia and Florida —  in the San Gabriel Valley. On Friday afternoon in San Francisco, Clinton will attend a Conversation with Hillary event hosted by Diana Nelson, chair of the Carlson global hospitality and travel company, followed by a Friday evening reception in Palo Alto hosted by venture capitalist Greg Sands and his wife, Sarah. Tickets to both events will cost the maximum allowable personal donation per election cycle, $2, 700. Hollywood rolled out the red carpet for Clinton in November, when she raised $1 million during a   fundraiser hosted by Christina Aguilera and her fiancé Matthew Rutler at their Beverly Hills home. During that trip, she also held a Thursday “Conservation With Hillary” breakfast at the Brentwood home of actor, director and producer Rob and his wife Michele Reiner for up to $2, 700 a ticket.
