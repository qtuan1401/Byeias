’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ” there are two boxes full of tech, and each   thinks it’s the only box. Whichever one gets there   first gets the job, and the second result is ignored.  ” ’  ’ ’   To get a little more technical, IEX customers connect to what’’s   called the IEX POP, where the famous ”speed bump” resides. Once   incoming messages have gotten through the coiled optical fiber,   they pass through the client gateway and then a sequencer and   head toward IEX’’s matching engines. It looks a little   like this: ’ ’  ’ ’   There are several factors that can contribute to one system   winning out over another, ranging from vibrations to temperature   to configuration.  ’ ’   This competition doesn’’t necessarily lead to speed. The input   into the IEX sequencer is higher than it otherwise would be   because of the ” ” approach, leading to a slower   system. It also increases cost.  ’ ’  ’ ”   There is one primary benefit to this approach. If one   application stops working, there’s another on the go   already.  ” ’   ”How do we control the impact of something that explodes?” Perkov   asked.  ’ ’   Perkov cited  as an example of what   can happen when one system goes down and the backup system   fails to come online. T ’ ’   ”The funny thing is that it is eventually going to happen,” he   said. ”It’’s about adapting to failure.” ’ ”   The technology is also a part of a broader philosophy at IEX. The   matching engines are turned off every night, and there are two   employees tasked with coming in every morning at 7 a. m. to start   them again. It’s the same idea: If one of those individuals is   slowed down by delays on the subway, there’s someone else there   to get it done. ” ’   ”Eventually I would like an   workforce,” Perkov   said. ’
