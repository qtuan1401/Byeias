This is the first time in Gallup’s polling of the ACA that the   law has cracked 50% approval since the firm began asking about   the law in November 2012. ” ’   The 55% approval and 41% disapproval of the ACA represents a   huge shift from just after the 2016 election. In November,    had only a 42% approval rating,   while 53% disapproved. ’ ’   The shift also comes after a number of polls have   showed increasing popularity for the law, as well as the   failure of the Republican Party to pass their repeal and   replacement bill  —   the American Health Care Act  —   through the   House. That legislation was viewed highly unfavorably, with one   survey suggesting as few as 17% of Americans viewed it in a   positive light. ’ ’ that 26% of those surveyed favored keeping   the ACA in place as it is. Another 40% wanted Obamacare in place   with significant changes, while 30% wanted Obamacare   repealed and replaced. ’ ’  ’ ’Apparently, all it took for Americans to warm. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
