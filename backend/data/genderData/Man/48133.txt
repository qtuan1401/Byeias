’  ’ ’   The family of a   man who was fatally shot last   week have released a statement describing a history of   harassment, intimidation, and even physical assault against them   by the suspect in the killing. ’ ”   Khalid Jabara of Tulsa was gunned down by a man the police   identified as his   neighbor Stanley Vernon Majors on the   steps of Jabara’s porch on Friday. ” ’   The family’’s statement said Majors had stalked members of   Jabara’’s family for years and once described them to the police   as ”dirty Arab” and ”filthy Lebanese.” He also hurled   Islamophobic epithets at the family, the statement said, even   though the Jabaras are Christian. ’ ’   ”Our brother’’s death could have been prevented,” said the   statement, published by Jabara’’s sister Victoria  on Monday. ”This man was a known danger.” ’ ”   The statement said that at the time of Jabara’s killing Majors   was awaiting trial on suspicion of running over Jabara’s mother   with his car last year  —   an attack that resulted in several   broken bones and a collapsed lung. ” ’  ’ ’   ”My family lived in fear of this man and his hatred for years,”   the family’’s statement said. ”Yet in May, not even one year after   he ran over our mother and despite our repeated protests, he was   released from jail with no conditions on his bond  —   no ankle   monitor, no   testing, nothing.” ’ ”   According to  Majors exited jail on bond in May.   Jabara learned Majors was armed on Friday and called the police   in fear for his family’s safety. ” ’   ”Khalid called the police stating this man had a gun and that he   was scared for what might happen,” the statement said. ”The   police came and told him there was nothing to be done. ’ ’   ”Minutes later, the suspect murdered our brother with four   shots.” ’ ’   Majors was arrested on suspicion of   murder and is   being held without bail, . ’ ’ ’
