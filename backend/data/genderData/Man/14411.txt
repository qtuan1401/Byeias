WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   America Rising PAC has released a new video titled “Race to the Bottom” that highlights the crippling divide between the Democratic Party’s Establishment and more leftist camps.   This month, Sanders and Perez kicked off their “Unity Tour” in Portland, Maine. Perez was booed by the crowd. “Maybe you came because you’re curious about the new DNC Chairman [Tom Perez] and the future of the Democratic Party,” the female speaker who introduced Perez said to loud boos and chants against Perez.  Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) has drawn much larger crowds than Perez has, which could be just one of several reasons why Perez had appeared to embrace more   rhetoric. Sanders had a significant and thriving base of supporters. “For a party with a message problem, there’s something exhausting about the overuse of the manure spreader,” Dickerson said. The video then shoots to a clip of Perez saying, “That is bullshit. ” And another of him saying, “The wall he wants to build it’s gonna have a garage door because all the shit he makes in Mexico. ” And then with a clip of Perez saying, “they call their budget a skinny budget I call it a shitty budget. ” In two scenes, Perez attempts to curb his foul mouth due to the presence of children. “It suggests a reliance on shock rather than strength of an argument,” Dickerson says of Perez. He posits, “In times of tension, do you keep your standards or do you drop them?” The ad closes out with Michelle Obama saying, “the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.
