’  ’ ”   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters)   The U. S. Department of Justice has   begun a criminal investigation into Uber’s use of a software tool   that helped its drivers evade local transportation regulators,   two sources familiar with the situation said. ” ’   Uber has acknowledged the software, known as ”Greyball,” helped   it identify and circumvent government officials who were trying   to clamp down on Uber in areas where its service had not yet been   approved, such as Portland, Oregon. ’ ’   The company prohibited the use of Greyball for this purpose   shortly after the New York Times revealed its existence in March,   saying the program was created to check ride requests to prevent   fraud and safeguard drivers. The Times report triggered a barrage   of negative publicity for the company. ’ ’   The criminal probe could become a significant problem facing the   company that is already struggling with an array of recent   business and legal issues. ’ ’   An Uber spokesman and the Justice Department declined to comment.   Uber lawyers said in letters to Portland authorities, which   Portland made public in a report last week, that the Greyball   technology was used ”exceedingly sparingly” in that city, before   the service was approved there in 2015. ’ ’   The nature of any potential federal criminal violation, and the   likelihood of anyone being charged, is unclear. The investigation   is still in its early stages, the sources said. ’ ’   Bloomberg news service reported the existence of a federal probe   last week, but did not identify it as criminal. ’ ’   Uber received a subpoena from a Northern California grand jury   seeking documents concerning how the software tool functioned and   where it was deployed, one person familiar with the request said.   That indicates a criminal investigation is underway. The second   source confirmed that was the case. ’ ’   A subpoena from a grand jury is a formal request for documents or   testimony concerning a potential crime. It does not, in itself,   indicate wrongdoing or mean charges will be brought. ’ ”   The ride services company’s board has retained an outside law   firm, Shearman & Sterling LLP, to conduct its own internal   investigation into what transpired, those two sources and a third   said. ” ’   A Shearman spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment. ’ ’   Uber, a venture   firm most recently valued at $68   billion, has long had a reputation as an aggressive startup. ’ ’  ’ ’   It has been battered with multiple controversies over the last   few months that have raised questions about Chief Executive   Travis Kalanick and led him to say he needed ”leadership help.” ’ ’   The technology at issue in the criminal probe helped Uber tag   some users so that they saw a different version of its standard   app, the company said in a blog post in March. ’ ’   Uber said Greyball obscured the real location of Uber cars in   various circumstances, including the possibility of physical   threats or merely to test new features. ’ ’   The program was part of a broader Uber system, called Violation   of Terms of Service, that analyzed credit card, device   identification, location data and other factors to predict   whether a request for a ride was legitimate, current and former   employees said. ’ ”   The technology was used partly to prevent fraud and protect   drivers from harm, the company blog post said. If a ride request   was deemed illegitimate, Uber’s app showed bogus information and   the requester would not be picked up, the employees told Reuters. ” ’   However, the Greyball technique was also used against suspected   local officials who could have been looking to fine drivers,   impound cars or otherwise prevent Uber from operating, the   employees said. ’ ”   The system might have gone farther than suggested by Uber’s terms   of service for app users. For example, it mined credit card   information to see if the owner was affiliated with a credit   union used by police and checked social media profiles to assess   the likelihood that the person was in law enforcement. ” ’   After the Times exposed the program in March, regulators who had   been unable to catch Uber in places where it was banned accused   the company of obstructing their inquiries. ’ ’   Transportation officials in Portland investigated and reported   last week that Uber had used Greyball to evade 16 Portland Bureau   of Transportation officials, denying them dozens of rides, in   December 2014 before Uber was authorized to operate there. ’ ’   The city said it found no evidence that the behavior was repeated   when Uber   the market in April 2015. ’ ’   Uber said it used the Greyball technology in December 2014, while   it was operating without approval, because it was “deeply   concerned that its   would be penalized   financially” or otherwise for their driving. ’ ’   (Editing by Peter Henderson and Bill Rigby) ’ ’SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters)   The U.
