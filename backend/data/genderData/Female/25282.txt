Speaking in a radio interview set to be broadcast on Sunday night, comic legend and staunch Republican Jackie Mason skewered Sen. Ted Cruz for taking the unusual move of formally naming a running mate despite the likelihood of being mathematically eliminated from winning the GOP presidential nomination short of a contested convention.  [Cruz last week announced Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate.  “Ted Cruz is living some kind of a fantasy,” Mason responded to the news. “Someone should tell him if he keeps thinking like this he’s going to wind up in a sanitarium, because he sounds like he’s nuts altogether. ” The comedian continued: A guy is actually drowning and instead of looking for a lifeguard, he’s looking for a vice president. It’s like a man going out of business and he’s about to go bankrupt and ten he tells you as he’s about to go out of business, ‘This is my new vice president.’ A vice president without a business. He added: “My    hasn’t made sense for thirty years but she should be given prizes for her intelligence compared to the insanity of everything Cruz is talking about. ” Mason was speaking during his regular segment on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” the popular weekend talk radio program broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Klein doubles as Breitbart’s senior investigative reporter and Jerusalem bureau chief.
