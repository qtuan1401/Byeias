On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” President Barack Obama said his former Secretary of State and current Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton was careless in how she handled her emails, which is under investigation by the FBI.  Obama said, “I continue to believe she has not jeopardized America’s national security. Now what I also said is that  —   and she’s acknowledged  —   that there’s a carelessness in terms of managing   that she has owned. And she recognizes that. But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective. this is somebody who served her country for four years as secretary of state and did an outstanding job and no one has suggested that in some ways as a consequence of how she’s handled   that that detracted from her excellent ability to carry out her duties. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
