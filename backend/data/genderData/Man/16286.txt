Glenn Beck filed a lawsuit in a Texas court against former TheBlaze CEO and Mercury Radio Arts COO Christopher Balfe over allegations of contract breach, fraud, unjust enrichment and other matters Monday. [Balfe served multiple roles in the Beck organization beginning in 2002 and was later elected to top positions with stock options and claimed $13 million in compensation from 2009 to 2014.  “This is a shockingly excessive amount that far exceeds appropriate compensation for companies of Mercury and TheBlaze’s size and financial performance,” the complaint noted. Beck’s attorneys also allege that Balfe did not submit his compensation scheme to Mercury Radio Arts’ board of directors, either. Breitbart News previously reported on the Beck media empire’s resorting to layoffs and other maneuvers to mitigate its $13 million debt. Law Newz originally obtained a copy of the complaint, filed in Dallas County, Texas. A copy of the filing has been made available below.
