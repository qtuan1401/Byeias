President Barack Obama boasted of his legacy during a town hall in Britain, asserting that he   handedly saved the world during his presidency. [“Saving the world economy from a Great Depression  —   that was pretty good,” Obama bragged when asked by a student in London what he wanted his legacy to be.  He recalled that when he visited London in 2009, the world economy was in a “freefall” because of irresponsible behavior of financial institutions around the world. “For us to be able to mobilize the world’s community, to take rapid action, to stabilize the financial markets, and then in the United States to pass Wall Streets reforms that make it much less likely that a crisis like that can happen again, I’m proud of that,” he said. Obama also touted his Iran nuclear deal as “something I’m very proud of” asserting that he successfully stopped their nuclear weapons program without going to war. He griped that everybody forgot about his efforts in stopping the Ebola crisis, saving “hundreds of thousands of lives. ” “I think that I have been true to myself during this process,” Obama said, insisting that the things he said while running for office “matched up” with his presidency. “I’ll look at a scorecard in the end,” he concluded. “Change takes time. Oftentimes what you start has then to be picked up by your successors or the next generation. ” He added that the fight for change was like a relay race and that he was prepared to pass the baton to his successor. “Hopefully they’re running in the right direction,” he joked.
