Earlier today, Gawker filed for bankruptcy. Now it appears that Ziff Davis will be acquiring the company in a court supervised auction. [The j2 Global Inc. subsidiary is already moving to salvage the floundering news media outlet. While other parties will have the opportunity to outbid the digital media company  —   something that founder Nick Denton has claimed is already happening  —   the Ziff Davis announcement casts a shadow of doubt over that bravado.  Nevertheless, Denton continues to believe that his bottom of the journalistic barrel will continue to need scraping, and they’ll still be the ones to do it: Even with his billions, Thiel will not silence our writers. Our sites will thrive  —   under new ownership  —   and we’ll win in court.  —   Nick Denton (@nicknotned) June 10, 2016,  We’ll see what happens as the filing and ensuing auction moves forward.
