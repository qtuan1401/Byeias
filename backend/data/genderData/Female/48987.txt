’  ’ ”   It’s a simple yes or no question  —   does Mylan know the terms of   its settlement with the Department of Justice or not? ” ’   Earlier this month it said it did. Specifically, it said it   struck a deal that would have it pay the   government $465 million for fleecing the Center for   Medicare and Medicaid for years.    But the question of whether this is accurate came up on   Friday, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) laid into the   Department of Justice for agreeing to such a deal. Warren called   the DOJ’’s settlement ”limp,” and said the settlement is too   low   based on her reading of the law.    But its not clear that this is the actual, final, size of the   settlement, and when we asked Mylan we got two answers. ’ ’   In early October, Mylan said that it ”   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’   We asked the DOJ to clarify whether or not terms have been   reached, and are awaiting a response. ’ ”   In the meantime, it’s a yes or no question. Are we going to see a   $465 million fine or not? ”
