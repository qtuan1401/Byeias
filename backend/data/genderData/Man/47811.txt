’  ’ ’   A few . ’ ’  ’ ’   Moreover, the  shrank  with the   private sector growing just 0. 2%      its lowest level in about 25 years. ’ ’   Still, Capital Economics Middle East economist Jason Tuvey argued   in a recent note that there was ”one area of the economy that   seems to be suffering particularly badly”: construction. ’ ’  ’ ’   Output in the construction sector dropped by 1. 9%      in the first quarter, and the NCB Construction Business Optimism   Index does not paint a rosy picture for the second quarter, which   you can see in the chart. ’ ’   ”Saudi Arabia’’s construction sector has borne the brunt of fiscal   austerity, and we expect activity there to remain weak for the   foreseeable future  —   history suggests that it could knock as much   as 0. 6%  off annual GDP growth,” Tuvey wrote. ’ ”   He added that the construction sector’s weakness could trickle   into other parts of the economy  —   in particular,     sectors  —   noting that builders already had delayed salary   payments and cut employment amid a lack of new projects. ” ’   The sector also seems as if it might have some financial health   concerns. A  found that   balance sheets in the Saudi construction sector were ”weaker than   in other sectors” and that it was the ”only major sector with a   debt service coverage ratio below 1.”        ’ ’   ”However, the chance of this triggering widespread stress in the   financial sector seems low,” Tuvey argued. ’ ’   ”Lending to the construction sector accounts for only around 8%   of total credit. And by our estimates, all loans to the sector   could sour and the banking sector as a whole would still meet   minimum capital requirements.” ’ ”   So, there’s that. ”
