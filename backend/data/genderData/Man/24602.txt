A Florida high school is backtracking its decision to deny a boy the chance to run for homecoming queen because of his gender. [Cypress Creek High School is now allowing student Anthony Martinez to run for homecoming queen after saying that the principal who initially denied the request never consulted with the district’s central office, WFTV reported.  Martinez became emotional when Cypress Creek High School’s principal, John McHale, told him he could not run for homecoming queen because he was a boy. “I started crying. Like, it made me really emotional considering how hard I was trying to be queen,” Martinez said to WFTV. When WFTV contacted the school district about the policy, a spokesperson for the school said Martinez could run for the king or queen position. The spokesperson said McHale “did not consult with the central office, but made what he thought was an appropriate decision at the time. ” The school’s   policy says the district cannot discriminate against students on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Martinez was overjoyed when he found out about the school’s decision to permit him to run for the queen position. “I just feel it’s phenomenal,” said Martinez. The principal sent WFTV an email Tuesday night saying that, after further research, any student may run for either homecoming king or queen.
