Tuesday on MSNBC’s special New Hampshire primary coverage, a passing motorist stopped to tell Republican presidential candidate Gov. John Kasich ( ) if she wasn’t a Hillary Clinton supporter she would vote for him instead of the “yahoo” currently in the lead.  The female Hillary supporter said, “I just want to say, if I weren’t registered Democratic, I would be voting for you. ” Kasich asked, “Can’t you switch and give me some help?” The woman explained,  “If you’re registered undeclared, you can pick either side, but if you’re registered one party or the other —  so I had to give my support to Hillary, because she’s who I want, ultimately. But I would rather have you running against her than the yahoo that is in the front. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
