Ohio Gov. John Kasich will not be campaigning in Nevada prior to the Republican caucuses on Tuesday. His campaign lists a series of events in Virginia and Georgia, but none in Nevada, in the last 72 hours before Republicans vote there. [Kasich is currently running fifth in Nevada, but is technically in fourth after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush dropped out after a disappointing result in South Carolina on Saturday evening. He is also fourth in Virginia, however, and fifth in Georgia, behind Dr. Ben Carson, among candidates who are still in the presidential race. So it is not clear why Kasich is avoiding Nevada in particular, where he still maintains an active campaign organization.  Carson is still campaigning in Nevada Sunday and Monday, despite running in last place among candidates still running. With Bush’s departure, Kasich is the last “establishment” candidate still standing in the GOP contest, and is likely looking ahead to the “SEC primary” on Super Tuesday, Mar. 1, as his best chance to make a mark on the race.
