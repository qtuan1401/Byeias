Retired U. S. Air Force Col. Rob Maness spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon and special   legendary Red Sox ace Curt Schilling, on politics and developing events in Louisiana, where Maness is running for Senate. [Maness said of Louisiana:  I wish the media would cover what’s really happening. Yesterday, we found a video that was live on Facebook of a guy he was just filming the fishermen showing up with their boats and where they were parking them and saying that the newspapers and the TV media weren’t covering it. One of my supporters said, when I put the video on my page, he said, it’s like Dunkirk. Nobody called them. They just showed up. This is the video Maness posted to his Facebook page: Maness also posted this video of a woman and her dog rescued from a sinking vehicle: Maness also discussed the current flooding in depth, saying: Our beloved Louisiana, the southern part of the state is really under water, from east of Baton Rouge, all the way out past Lafayette. The houses are under water.  I think the 500 year floodplain has every home under water in it, and more is forecast. The rivers are still rising, nothing’s crested yet, and more rain is expected.
