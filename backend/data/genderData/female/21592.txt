Tuesday on Fox Business Channel while commenting on the hacked DNC emails released by Wikileaks, which is reported to have a connection to the Russian government, “Clinton Cash” author Peter Schweizer said it was Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton who have extensive ties to the Russian government.  Schweizer said,”Who knows what the Russian government is up to at any given moment. What we do know is when it comes to the Clintons, they have long, strong financial ties relating to Russia. Bill Clinton gave a $500, 000 speech in Moscow right before this uranium transfer was approved  —   that was for a company called Renaissance in Russia, which is well known at the senior levels to be populated by Russian intelligence officials with close ties to the Kremlin. There is this uranium deal you talked about. We have other research that is going to be coming out in the next few days involving money transfers related to the Russian reset. So the notion that the Clintons have no connection to the Russians and no flow of Russian money is ludicrous. It’s long, it’s substantial, and it involves the very critical national security issues including, as you mentioned, American uranium. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
