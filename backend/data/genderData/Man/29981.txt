On Wednesday, MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”   Mika Brzezinski called for DNC Chair Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) to “step down” over her handling of this year’s Democratic presidential primary.  After playing a clip of Wasserman Schultz, Brzezinski said, “This has been very poorly handled from the start. Ot has been unfair, and they haven’t taken him seriously, and it starts, quite frankly, with the person that we just heard speaking. It just does. ” Brzezinski added of Wasserman Schultz, “She should step down. ” Brzezinski’s   former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough wondered why Sanders would “get in line” for the Democratic Party, given that they “rigged the entire thing,” and that if he was in Sanders’ position, “I’d say, ‘Go straight to hell, I’m running as an independent. ’” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
