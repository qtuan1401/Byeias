Washington (CNN) Turnabout is fair play in Iowa, according to Sen. Joni Ernst.  Ernst, the Iowa Republican whose ”Roast and Ride” event drew 2016 GOP presidential contenders to the state over the weekend, told CNN’s Dana Bash on ”State of the Union” that ”it’s not enough to be a woman” in reference to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner.  ”You have to care about women’s issues,” Ernst said. ”And women’s issues here in Iowa are that we have a strong economy we have jobs that our sons and daughters can go off to someday we have a great educational system. And women want strong national defense. We want to know that our families are going to be safe.”  RELATED: Iowa is Hog heaven for GOP hopefuls, Ernst’s comments were a sharp retooling of a line Clinton had used in campaigning against Ernst in 2014. ”I would also add, it’s not enough to be a woman. You have to be committed to expand rights and opportunities for all women,” Clinton had said while campaigning on behalf of Ernst’s Democratic opponent, Bruce Braley. While the Republican field is packed with male candidates, so far, some of the sharpest Clinton critiques have come from women, namely GOP presidential candidate and former CEO Carly Fiorina, and now Ernst.  Democrats successfully campaigned on an alleged GOP perpetrated ”war on women” in 2012, but faltered in 2014 when they tried the same tactic. With Hillary Clinton as the likely Democratic nominee, the fight for women voters will be a central part of the 2016 campaign.
