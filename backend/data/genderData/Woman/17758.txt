President Barack Obama and his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have   a campaign event together, after their first scheduled appearance together was canceled. [According to the Clinton campaign, the event will take place on July 5 in Charlotte, North Carolina.  “President Obama and Hillary Clinton will discuss building on the progress we’ve made and their vision for an America that is stronger together,” the campaign statement read. The first event was planned in June for Green Bay Wisconsin. It was canceled after the terrorist attack at a gay bar in Orlando, Florida. It took two weeks for both parties to reschedule. Clinton has spent time rallying with prominent Democrats as she prepares to accept the presidential nomination of her party in Cleveland. Earlier this week, she campaigned with Senator Elizabeth Warren in Ohio.
