’  ’ ”   HONOLULU (AP)  —   The White House says President Barack Obama has   pardoned 78 people and shortened the sentence of 153 others   convicted of federal crimes. It’s the most number of individual   clemencies in a single day by any president. ” ’   Obama has been granting commutations at   pace in his   final months in office, but he has focused primarily on   shortening sentences rather than pardons. Pardons amount to   forgiveness of a crime that removes restrictions on the right to   vote and lessens the conviction stigma. ’ ”   Neil Eggleston, Obama’s White House counsel, says Obama has now   pardoned a total of 148 people during his presidency and has   shortened the sentences of 1, 176 people, including 395 serving   life sentences. ” ”   Eggleston says the clemency actions exemplify Obama’s belief that   America is a nation of second chances. ”
