Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( ) said she believes the scandal over Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state  is not worth making a “federal case” out of it because Clinton just wanted a “little bit of a private life. ”  “Oh, wait a second. I don’t believe she was trying to hide anything,” she said. “I’ve known Hillary for a quarter of a century. Let me tell you what I do think. I think this is a woman who wants a little bit of a private life. She wants to be able to communicate with husband, with daughter, with friends and not have somebody looking over her shoulder into her emails. Having said that, it is what it is and, you know, I don’t think we should make a federal case over it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
