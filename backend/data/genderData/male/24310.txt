The latest from Counter Jihad shows an alliance between radical leftist groups to cause riots and violence. [The video showcases speaker Khalilah Sabra from the Muslim American Society at a rally, where she encourages her fellow Muslims to start a revolution in America.   “Basically you are the new black people of America,” she said. “That we are the community that staged a revolution across the world. If we can do that, why can’t we have that revolution in America?” She continued by saying, “You know what you should do. And if we do it, Allah has promised us the same victories that he granted to those who came before us. ” But as Counter Jihad pointed out, America already had her revolution “to ensure all Americans could enjoy Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. ”
