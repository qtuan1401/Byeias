In his latest talk at the University of Houston as part of his ‘Dangerous Faggot Tour,’ Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos said that one of the ways the left can defeat the   would be with the criminalization of Black Lives Matter.[  “The left does this insane sleight of hand where they try to suggest not liking Black Lives Matter is the same thing as hating black people,” he said. “No one is stupid enough to believe that but they keep doing it,” he continued. He admitted that the black community is right to have grievances, such as poor educational standards, saying that “they need better f***ing schools,” but that Black Lives Matter was not the solution. However, he also contended that a “violent movement that throws its toys out the pram and leaves black communities in ruins is [not] the answer to those problems. ” “We are entering the black power phase of Black Lives Matter existence and it is crossing over into a terrorist organisation. It’s time to criminalize it,” he continued.  You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
