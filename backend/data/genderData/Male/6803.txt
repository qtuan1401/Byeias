Two weeks ago, Pita Taufatofua gained a sudden, if fleeting, international fame. At the opening ceremony of the Rio Games, Taufatofua carried the flag of the tiny South Pacific nation Tonga while shirtless and covered in coconut oil, his sculptured torso gleaming. Besides lighting up the internet, his   appearance earned him a segment on the “Today” show, in which the hosts enthusiastically, and to some controversy, oiled him up. But Taufatofua is fundamentally an athlete. And with the Olympics almost over, he finally got his chance to be an athlete on Saturday morning, in the heavyweight taekwondo competition. Taufatofua was up against it. At 32, he was fighting in his first Olympics after three failed attempts to qualify. His opponent, Sajjad Mardani of Iran, had won a silver medal at the 2013 world championships. Taufatofua saluted the fans when he arrived at the mat. They quickly adopted him, chanting, “Tonga, Tonga. ” Mardani struck quickly. The score was   and then  . Taufatofua gamely attacked, trying punches and spinning kicks. When he scored his one and only point, the crowd exploded, and he raised a fist in triumph. Final score:  . “I lost, and I’m smiling,” Taufatofua said afterward. “I got a point, and it was the happiest point I ever got in my life. ” It is easy to be cynical about the pieties of the Olympics, and some in the skeptical press corps may have found Taufatofua, who works as a counselor for homeless children, too good to be true. But why not end the Games with a dose of Tongan idealism? Taufatofua says his goal is to “bring the world closer together. ” A sincere good luck to him. VICTOR MATHER I was moving around the Maracanã stadium during the opening ceremony when I bumped into performers dressed in   critter costumes in a hall leading to the stands. They had left the field a few minutes before, and with a sign warning cast members not to go into the stands, they were essentially forbidden to watch the opening ceremony that they had helped to make. Still, they seemed enchanted and proud of the ceremony some had teary eyes. I was happy that they broke the rule and got to see a bit of the beautiful show they had helped put on. As it turned out, it was common to see the work force trying to sneak a peek at the Olympics. Ticket prices kept the Games out of reach for   Brazilians, and workers at the Games, well, had to work. But I saw cleaning people off to the side, trying to watch the judoka Rafaela Silva win Brazil’s first gold medal of the Games. SERGIO PEÇANHA I arrived late to a men’s basketball game between Argentina and the United States, and the press section was filled to overflowing. So much the better. I wandered out into the stands and found a seat among the Argentines, who had descended on Rio de Janeiro by the many thousands for this game. I am a lifetime Mets fan, which describes its own sort of insanity, and I found gloriously lunatic and recognizable companions. For two hours, they jumped up and down in unison and sang. They screamed they whistled they cried. And I can say with clinical accuracy that for the first time in my life, as the far bigger American squad asserted its writ and the game slipped away from Argentina, I saw men trying to pull their hair out. Sitting among fans is one of the great joys of the Olympics. In Manaus, in heat so radiant you could all but touch it, I sat among Colombian soccer fans who rained wonderfully creative chants on Hope Solo, the        American goalkeeper. The Brazilians joined in  —   Solo had earlier implied that Brazil could be enjoyed only with a mosquito net and a scarf over the face  —   with chants of “Zika! Zika!” (My interpreter told me of many other wondrously creative insults, almost all of which, unfortunately, cannot be published here.) MICHAEL POWELL News conferences are always overstuffed with reporters and prone to zaniness when Usain Bolt is involved. Just before the Games began, Bolt held a media event in Rio de Janeiro featuring   dancers and a journalist who rapped a question. Late Thursday, after he had won the gold medal in the   dash, Bolt arrived at a news conference room and plopped into a chair between Andre De Grasse of Canada and Christophe Lemaitre of France, who had won silver and bronze. Before the athletes had stepped onto the stage, a press officer for the Olympics had suggested to the dozens of reporters that they play a prank on Bolt by directing questions only to the other runners. The lark lasted for about three questions before a local journalist, who had apparently missed the directive, started to ask Bolt something. The room filled with boos, and then laughter, leaving Bolt with a confused smile. Moments later, another reporter took the microphone. “Usain, let’s imagine Bob Marley is alive,” he began. The reporter wanted to know what Marley, a Jamaica native like Bolt, would have named a song had he written one about Bolt. The crowd broke up again with laughter, but Bolt grinned and took the question in stride. “‘Greatest of All Time,’” he said. ANDREW KEH The Olympics are a realm where displays of grace and boorish behavior occur one after another, and sometimes simultaneously. To wit, the   men’s badminton match between Scott Evans of Ireland and Ygor Coelho de Oliveira of Brazil. Even before a point was scored, history was made: De Oliveira was the first Brazilian man to compete at the Olympics in the sport. He had learned at an academy,   by his father, in a favela not far from where the competition unfolded. Naturally, the stands were chockablock with de Oliveira’s fans. Chants of “Ygor, Ygor” might have been among the most joyful noises made in the last three weeks. But much of the glee was drained from the arena in the first game, which de Oliveira lost,  . Evans’s overhead smash seemed unreturnable. De Oliveira made a few unforced errors. It looked hopeless. But in the second game, de Oliveira elevated his game. He stopped making mistakes and started putting away the shuttlecock with dink shots that barely cleared the net. When he took a commanding lead and then eked out a   win in the second game, his fans were in a state of near hysteria. That proved to be the peak of de Oliveira mania. He lost the third and final game, and it was not close. When the match ended, Evans acted as if he had won the gold and the lottery. He ran in circles. He took off his shirt. He left de Oliveira at the net, waiting for a handshake. It was the kind of obnoxiousness usually seen only in professional wrestling, where performers want to be booed. The Brazilian crowd obliged, of course. But de Oliveira kept his poise, a    mature beyond his years  —   and perhaps already plotting his path to the next Olympics. DAVID SEGAL Soldiers and police officers provided a constant backdrop at the Rio Olympics, and after a while you didn’t pay much attention to their presence. Still, an armed escort for a news media bus was out of the ordinary. When one did appear late on a Saturday night while I was riding back to the press center from an outlying venue, I took notice. What was striking, though, at least to me, was that none of the other two dozen journalists aboard seemed to notice. And what were my fellow members of the news media doing while we traveled along a highway with a soldier or a police officer (hard to say which) on a motorcycle in front of us and a truck filled with soldiers bringing up the rear? Well, some were dozing. (Covering the Olympics is a grind, and it was late.) All the others were looking at their phones. This was the bus line that had gained attention when a window was shattered by something  —   perhaps a bullet, more likely a rock. That may have explained why, days later, we were suddenly getting an escort. It doesn’t explain, of course, why no one else noticed. But did I mention it was late? JAY SCHREIBER Badminton players take their shuttlecocks seriously. The little feathery birds, after all, are critical to the game. I got a sense of this when I wrote about how they are made. Olympic referees and representatives of Yonex, which made the shuttles used in Rio, talked lovingly about them. So I asked where they were kept, assuming they would be in a special   secret vault. I was led behind a giant black curtain that separated the three main courts and the fans from the event organizers and the athletes. Within 50 feet, I came upon a door to a temporary office. I could have scaled the flimsy walls, and there was no roof. Inside was a storage space with a bunch of cardboard boxes holding the shuttlecocks. How dull is that? Still, the sneak peek made me realize how finicky athletes are about their pursuits and their equipment, and how the rest of the world will never fully understand. KEN BELSON Crowds of ticket buyers swelled in one area Wednesday night, but no sporting events were taking place there. Far from the Olympic Park, in the Botafogo neighborhood, a   neoclassical mansion sparkled. Security personnel, some wearing thobes, traditional Qatari men’s tops, directed gawkers to the ticket window. For 20 reais  —   a little more than $6  —   they could find out why so many people had flocked there during the past two weeks. This was part of an entirely separate competition, carried out by large multinational companies and foreign governments looking to promote their causes with hospitality suites. In scale, the Qatari government left all others in the dust, renting a    site that the   Daros Latinamerica Collection, an art exhibitor, owned until last year. The collection sold what is still called Casa Daros to a Brazilian school backed by the billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, a friend of Warren Buffett’s. Inside, Brazilians donned abayas, a type of traditional Qatari women’s garb. A museum feel still prevailed, as several rooms displayed Qatar’s plans for, and the work it has done on, the 2022 World Cup, which it will host. Given the struggles of FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, Qatar is under pressure to defend itself. It was making a hard sale.   guides walked multiple groups of more than a dozen Brazilians through the exhibits. One room even showcased Qatar’s antidoping lab. In the main hall, hundreds of Brazilians sampled Qatari clothes and calligraphy. One area, though, was  : the two fancy restaurants. They were reserved for International Olympic Committee and Qatar Olympic Committee officials and their families. Some things never change. VINOD SREEHARSHA Every morning in the Olympic Park, dozens of reporters gathered in a large meeting room, named Samba, for the daily news conference of the International Olympic Committee. It happened in English, and sometimes partly in Portuguese, with live translation into eight other languages. We collected a lot of facts that never made it into stories: the count of urine samples taken from Olympians (3, 491 as of Friday) the average number of daily visitors to the Olympic Park megastore (85, 000) and the   items there (a plush toy mascot,   and caipirinha shot glasses). Over the weeks, there were questions about the color of the diving pool water (why did it turn green?) the Ryan Lochte incident (why did official stories change?) transportation troubles at the Games (why the shortage of cars and buses?) and the splashy arrest of a top Olympic official who was accused of scalping tickets. Officials answered some of those questions directly. They skillfully deflected others, or declined to respond, they said, for legal reasons. Halfway through the Games, as we settled in for the morning ritual, a reporter turned to me and proclaimed the dodge ball event to be his favorite one of the Olympics. “Which venue is that in?” I asked. “It’s here,” he replied, “in Samba. ” REBECCA R. RUIZ Athletes’ comments are often scripted and anodyne, full of tedious platitudes. As with actors, sometimes you just don’t want to hear their earnest recitations about how they prepared for their roles. So how great it was to see (on TV, not in person) the O’Donovan brothers, Gary and Paul, of Ireland,   with excitement after winning their silver medal in the lightweight double sculls? It was their country’s first rowing medal, and its first medal in Rio. Interviewed by Irish television, the two mused on the novelty of the medal process  —   they got to wear “podium pants,” whatever those are, for the ceremony  —   and the strange exigencies of the postrace doping test. “I was trying to take a pee in a cup for them, and I drank about 10 liters of water,” Paul O’Donovan said. “I’m quite full, to be honest. ” They talked about how hungry they were. “We haven’t had anything to eat since two hours ago, when we had bread rolls and some Nutella,” Gary O’Donovan said. They said they were sorry not to be back home at the pub in Lisheen, in a rural part of County Cork, where their friends were celebrating their victory. Paul, who had caused earlier   delight by describing his rowing technique as “close the eyes and pull like a dog,” added that the two actually enjoyed giving interviews. In a competition too full of   preening egotists, this was the best comment of all. “We are just excited that we have other people to talk to apart from ourselves,” he said. SARAH LYALL On my way to interview an International Olympic Committee official in the organization’s luxury hotel on the beach, I hopped into an Uber. The car was nice. Leather seats. Little candies in the cup holder. The driver, who was wearing a suit, offered me water or juice from a cooler on the front seat. “Do you need anything to make the drive more comfortable?” he asked in nearly perfect English. I complimented him on his professionalism and service. Many Uber drivers in Rio, he explained, are businessmen who lost their jobs in the recession. Just before the Olympics, he said, he was laid off from his position at a global technology company. He had worked in the United States for several years. Now he was driving to make ends meet. His Uber car was actually his wife’s car because he considered his own vehicle too expensive to use. The windows on that car were bulletproof because his drive to work had been so dangerous. He would not be attending any Olympic events, he said. Not enough cash for that. He dropped me off at the hotel, where I had to go through tight security to enter the building. I. O. C. members are receiving $900 per diem payments, according to news reports. The dichotomy between life at the I. O. C. and life here was glaring. JULIET MACUR Olympic pin trading might someday become a medal sport at the Games, but for now it’s a great way to meet people from different countries and take on the adventure of haggling in different languages. And really, for me, the Olympics are all about meeting people. So when a young Brazilian was determined to give me an Estonia pin for my beautiful Canada pin (in the shape of a maple leaf) I had to say no. You see, there was a story behind the Canada pin, which I relayed to my potential new trading partner. The woman who had given me the pin had said she would do so if I did a handstand. I explained that my handstand days were long past (actually, they never existed). We had a good laugh, and we worked out a deal for a New York Times pin. That little interlude made the pin more valuable to me because I had that story to tell. I could see that the young man was disappointed, so I offered him a more bland Canada pin I had obtained earlier. He wasn’t interested, and off we went in opposite directions. A few minutes later, he tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Let’s make a story. ” JIM LUTTRELL Katie Ledecky was talking about Bruce Gemmell, her swimming coach since the fall of 2012, when her voice cracked and tears welled in her eyes. It was after her last race, the   freestyle, in which she had shattered her world record for her fifth medal, and her fourth gold. With her Summer Games finally done, Ledecky seemed to realize that the childhood chapter of her life was also coming to a close. In a few weeks, she would be leaving home in Bethesda, Md. for her freshman year at Stanford. The magnitude of the week that was behind her and the year that stretched in front of her  —   new coast, new coach, new school, new team, new friends  —   appeared to overwhelm Ledecky, who began to cry as she sat on the interview dais, flanked by the silver medalist Jazmin Carlin and the bronze medalist Boglarka Kapas. As Ledecky struggled to regain her composure, Carlin reached over and petted her arm, as if to console her. Never mind that Ledecky had beaten Carlin by 11 seconds at that moment, Ledecky had never looked less like a swimming machine. KAREN CROUSE
