In a video collaboration between CNN’s “State of the Union” and FactCheck. org released on Friday, CNN anchor Jake Tapper stated that Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s claim during an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that FBI Director James Comey testified that her statements about her emails were true was a false claim, and “all you politicians out there, you are perfectly entitled to your own opinions, not to your own facts. ”  Tapper said, “Is that true? Did FBI Director James Comey testify that the repeated comments Hillary Clinton had made to the public about her private email server ‘were truthful’? No, that is not true. ” Tapper then stated that Clinton’s campaign has pointed to Comey’s testimony that he had no evidence to conclude that Clinton lied to the FBI, but he then pointed out that Clinton wasn’t asked her comments to the FBI on “Fox News Sunday. ” Instead, she was being asked about what she said to the public. Tapper then played video of Comey stating that Clinton’s claims that nothing on her emails was marked classified and no classified material was emailed by here weren’t true. Tapper continued that more than 2, 000 of Clinton’s emails contained classified information, most of which were classified retroactively, but that 110 emails contained information that was classified at the time the emails were sent or received. He added that 3 of the emails had classified markings, but they were marked improperly. He concluded, “He [Comey] did say that some of the emails contained information that was classified at the time, and Hillary Clinton had repeatedly told the public that none of the emails contained information that was classified in any way. A reminder to all you politicians out there, you are perfectly entitled to your own opinions, not to your own facts. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
