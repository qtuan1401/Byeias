A club to worship Satan may be coming to a Utah elementary school, KUTV reports.  The Satanic Temple is seeking equal treatment as Good News Clubs, which is a group that teaches Christianity in an after school program. Granite School District may have no choice but to allow the Satanic group rent out space, but the group will not be allowed to reach out to and promote to students on campus. Satanic Temple released a disturbing promotional video that said the After School Satan Club would be coming to schools nationwide.  Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
