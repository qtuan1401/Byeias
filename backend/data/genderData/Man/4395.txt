Jake Gyllenhaal is delaying his return to Broadway. A revival of Lanford Wilson’s “Burn This,” starring Mr. Gyllenhaal, that was scheduled to begin performances in February at a    Hudson Theater, is instead being postponed, the producers Stacey Mindich and Jessica R. Jenen said in a brief statement Friday evening. They said the postponement was “due to scheduling conflicts with the show’s star,” and that “the show is now aiming for its Broadway bow during the   season. ” Mr. Gyllenhaal, primarily known for his work on film, has appeared on Broadway once before, in “Constellations,” a   play by Nick Payne, which ran for three months in 2014 and 2015. The Ambassador Theater Group, which is reconverting the Hudson from a hotel event space into a theater, said it plans to announce another production soon. Mr. Gyllenhaal’s fans, however, have another opportunity to see him onstage in New York: Next week he is scheduled to star in four concert performances of “Sunday in the Park with George” at New York City Center.
