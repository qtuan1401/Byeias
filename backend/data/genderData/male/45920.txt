’’ ”Many of Latin America’s poorest workers have climbed out of poverty in recent years, but their wages continued to be insufficient to classify them as   workers, according to World Bank data  by a UN release.” ’Laborers earning between $4 and $10 a day make up 38% of the region’s population. These workers,  to the World Bank, are considered “vulnerable. ”’ ’The poor in Latin America, those who make less than $4 a day, are 24% of the population.   workers are those making between $10 and $50 a day.’ ’Latin American workers who have moved out of poverty to eke by on between $4 and $10 a day have done so largely because of the region’s  in the first decade of the 21st century.’ ’’ ’Economic progress in the region has already started to slow in recent years. In 2015, a UN commission  ”that 28% of the region’’s population, or 167 million people, were mired in poverty in 2014. ”’ ’”It seems the recovery from the international financial crisis was not taken advantage of sufficiently to . .. reduce vulnerability from economic cycles,”  Alicia Barcena, the head the UN’’s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, in January 2015.’ ’Many countries in the region have seen inequality grow and wages struggle to keep pace with costs of living.’ ’In Brazil, wracked by  the government announced an 11. 7% boost to the minimum wage in December 2015, just above the country’s 10. 6% inflation for that year.

The percentage increase was twice the 2015 inflation rate.’ ’However, Mexico’s minimum wage remains  in the region, and the country’s working poor, the percentage of the population who can’t feed a family with the household’s income, rose from 32. 9% in the third quarter of 2008 to 41. 4% in the first quarter of 2015,  to El Daily Post.’ ’’ ’And inequality remains a persistent problem   —   and in Mexico in particular.’ ’A 2015 report found that 2, 540 of Mexico’s nearly 125 million residents held  a disparity that may further deprive the lower and middle classes in the country of whatever economic gains the region makes.’ ’“In the most unequal economies, poor people tend to receive fewer benefits from economic growth,”  to El Daily Post.’ ”Many of Latin America’s poorest workers have. ..”
