Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) is weighing in after Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) asked for the resignation of his Communications Director, saying that “no lie is too big and no trick too dirty” for Cruz. [“Rick is a really good spokesman who had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected,” the Rubio campaign told Patrick Svitek of Texas Monthly.  “There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom, that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty. Rick did the right thing by apologizing to Marco. It’s high time for Ted Cruz to do the right thing and stop the lies. ” John Nolte of Breitbart News reported Monday that Cruz fired Tyler after he posted a false video over the weekend attacking Rubio. Tyler posted a video that falsely claimed (using subtitles) Rubio told a staffer that there are “not many answers” in the Bible. The truth is that Rubio said, “all of the answers” are in the Bible. Once the truth came out Monday morning, Tyler published an apology on Facebook. Rubio didn’t let it go. The Florida Senator demanded accountability, and now Tyler is out.
