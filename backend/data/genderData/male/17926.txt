Connecticut police have appealed to lawmakers for the ability to own and use armed drones after a bill that aims to ban the weaponization of the devices was discussed on Monday. [“We’ve had a report that somebody’s going to fly a drone into an airplane, into an engine, or it’s a weaponized drone,” claimed Farmington Police Chief Paul Melanson in an appeal to use armed drones for public safety. “We’re concerned and we don’t have those answers yet. ”  Melanson argued that in situations of high risk, it would allow police to “use a robot in order to keep the public or officer safe. ” If the bill was passed, it would make it illegal for someone “who is not physically present to release tear gas or control a deadly weapon, explosive or incendiary device” as well as “limit the use of a drone by law enforcement and other state agencies” and “establish retention and destruction requirements for information collected by law enforcement using drones. ” Berlin Police Chief Paul Fitzgerald also expressed his support for armed police drones, saying, “I think it’s important not to limit law enforcement or public safety’s ability to protect the public. You don’t want to get into an arms race, I understand that, but we have to be prepared to handle unforeseen situations  …     at a public event, a crime or a terrorist incident. ” Attempts to create more legislature around drones have been rapidly tightening since their recent growth in popularity. Just before Christmas, the FAA announced that all drones in the US ranging between 0. 55 and 50 pounds had to be registered or face civil penalties of up to $27, 500 and three years in jail.
