Because the bucket is very heavy, the man walks slowly and pauses often. But because the bucket is very heavy, the man keeps walking. The man, seen in a surveillance video, has just taken a black, metal   bucket off the back of an armored truck in broad daylight in Midtown Manhattan. The bucket was left unattended when a guard went to the truck’s cab for a moment, the police said, and the man probably did not know what was in it. But he probably had a suspicion. “I think he just seen an opportunity and took the pail and walked off,” Detective Martin Pastor told   which broadcast the footage on Tuesday. The theft took place on Sept. 29. On the video, the man walks calmly through crowds on West 48th Street, as calmly as a man can walk while lugging a very heavy and perhaps very valuable bucket that does not belong to him. At one point, the man  —   stocky, maybe in his 50s, wearing a down vest and   shirt  —   rests the bucket on the sidewalk to catch his breath. He crosses Fifth Avenue, heading east. He makes his way to Third Avenue, a distance of a  . It takes him an hour, WNBC said. At Third Avenue and 48th Street, the police said, the man disappears. The bucket contained 86 pounds of gold flakes, worth $1. 6 million, the police said. Detective Pastor said the police believe that the man is in Florida. The gold flakes are still at large as well.
