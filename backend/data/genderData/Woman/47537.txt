’  ’ ’     ’ ’   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP)    Bangladeshi forces stormed an upscale   Dhaka restaurant where heavily armed militants held dozens of   people hostage Saturday morning, killing at least six of the   attackers and rescuing 13 captives including foreigners at the   end of the   standoff. ’ ”   About 35 people were taken hostage, including about 20   foreigners, when gunmen stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery in   Dhaka’s Gulshan area, a diplomatic zone, on Friday night. ” ’   ”We have gunned down at least six terrorists and the main   building is cleared but the operation is still going on,” Lt.   Col. Tuhin Mohammad Masud, commander of the Rapid Action   Battalion, told The Associated Press three hours after the   commandos launched the rescue operation. ’ ’   He said there were casualties among other hostages, but did not   provide details. ’ ’   Masud said the rescued included a Japanese, who was injured, and   two Sri Lankans. He said that some of the militants were   captured. ’ ’   The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack,   according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadis   activity online. A news agency affiliated with the Islamic Group   claimed that 24 people had been killed and 40 wounded, including   foreigners, according to SITE. The figures could not be   independently confirmed. ’ ’   The Amaq news agency also posted photos purportedly showing the   bodies of hostages. The authenticity of the pictures could not be   confirmed either. ’ ’   With the sound of gunfire and explosions, local TV stations   reported that the rescue operation began at 7:40 a. m. It included   army personnel with automatic weapons and at least seven armored   vehicles and ambulances. ’ ’  ’ ’   Local media reported that an Argentine and two Bangladeshis also   were rescued from the restaurant early Saturday, but details   about their condition were not immediately available. ’ ”   Commandos storming the restaurant discovered five bodies lying in   blood, a police official who was not identified told Channel 24   TV station. It wasn’t clear if they were militants or hostages. ” ’   The attack marks an escalation in the growing drumbeat of   militant violence to hit the traditionally moderate     nation in the past three years, but with   increasing frequency in recent months. Most attacks have been by     men singling out individual activists,   foreigners and religious minorities. ’ ’   Bangladesh did not immediately respond to the claim of   responsibility by IS, but in the past have denied that the   extremist group has a presence in the country. The U. S. State   Department said it had seen the IS claim, but could not confirm   its authenticity. ’ ’   The attackers ”have not responded to authorities’’ calls for   negotiation,” said Masud. ’ ’   He said that the security cordon would prevent any of the   attackers from escaping. Authorities also ordered internet   services to be blocked across the country, according to internet   service provider Aamra. ’ ’   Police said the two officers died at a hospital after being   wounded in the initial gunfire with as many as nine attackers,   who also hurled bombs. Ten of 26 people who were wounded when the   militants opened fire were listed in critical condition, and six   were on life support, according to hospital staff. The injuries   ranged from broken bones to gunshot wounds. Only one civilian was   among the wounded. ’ ’  ’ ’   Kitchen staffer Sumon Reza, who escaped, said the attackers   chanted ”Allahu Akbar” (God is Great) as they launched the attack   around 9:20 p. m. Friday, initially opening fire with blanks. ’ ”   The nationalities of the hostages were not immediately clear. On   Saturday, Japan’s top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said at   a hastily called news conference in Tokyo that the government is   trying to confirm that Japanese were among the hostages. Prime   Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that saving lives is the top   priority. ” ’   Among the hostages was a businessman and his wife and two   children, according to his uncle Anwarul Karim. ’ ’   ”My nephew Hasnat Karim called me and said he was inside with his   family. He told me, ’’Please save us, please! ’’ And he hung up,” he   said. ”We do not know what is going on there.” ’ ”   In Washington, a White House official said President Barack Obama   was briefed on the attack by his chief counterterrorism adviser   Lisa Monaco. The president asked to be kept informed as the   situation develops, said the official, who was not authorized to   speak publicly about the president’s meetings. ” ’  ’ ’   State Department spokesman John Kirby says the U. S. is in contact   with the Bangladesh government and has offered its assistance to   bring those responsible to justice. ’ ’   He said all official American personnel are accounted for with no   injuries reported, and the department is working with local   authorities to determine if any U. S. citizens and     staff were affected. ’ ’   The spree of recent attacks in Bangladesh have raised fears that   religious extremists are gaining a foothold in the country,   despite its traditions of secularism and tolerance. ’ ’   About two dozen atheist writers, publishers, members of religious   minorities, social activists and foreign aid workers have been   slain since 2013. On Friday, a Hindu temple worker was hacked to   death by at least three assailants in southwest Bangladesh. IS   and and   affiliates have claimed responsibility for many   of the attacks. ’ ”   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government has cracked down on   domestic radical Islamists. It has accused local terrorists and   opposition political parties   especially the main opposition   Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its Islamist ally        of orchestrating the violence in order to   destabilize the nation, which both parties deny. ” ’ Associated Press writers Katy Daigle in New Delhi, Matthew   Pennington in Washington and Ken Moritsugu in Tokyo contributed   to this report. ’ ’     ’
