As part of her summer trip overseas to Morocco, First Lady Michelle Obama celebrated Ramadan by joining the royal family for an Iftar dinner at the palace in Marrakesh. [She was joined by her daughters Sasha and Malia as well as actress Meryl Streep. The Iftar dinner is a traditional Muslim feast celebrating the end of the Ramadan daily fast.  The members of the First Family were likely familiar with the tradition, as President Barack Obama has hosted an annual Iftar dinner at the White House during his presidency.  The First Lady is traveling this summer with her daughters and mother to Liberia, Morocco and Spain, under the umbrella of her “Let Girls Learn” initiative. President Barack Obama is traveling to Canada this week for the North American Leaders Summit.
