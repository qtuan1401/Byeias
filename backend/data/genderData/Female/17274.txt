Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton paid tribute to the shooting victims of the terrorist attack at a gay night club in Florida  —   even as the father of the shooter, Seddique Mateen, was sitting right behind her. [“I know how many people, loved ones and friends, are still grieving,” she said during her rally in Kissimmee, Florida. “And I want them to know that we will be with you. We will be with you as you rebuild your lives, as you rebuild hope for the future, because we can’t ever let that kind of hatred and violence break the spirit, break the soul, of any place in America. ”  But Clinton failed to mention that the attack was a result of the shooter’s alignment with radical Islam or terrorism. As she was speaking about Orlando, Mateen was spotted behind Clinton taking pictures of her with his phone, before putting on a red hat.
