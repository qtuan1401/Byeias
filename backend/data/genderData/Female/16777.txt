Blackwater founder Erik Prince told Breitbart News Saturday SiriusXM host Alex Marlow that the Obama administration “hung out to dry” the Turkey coup plotters, adding that President Obama has “been tilting toward an Islamist or Muslim Brotherhood approach to foreign policy,” so the quick support for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the midst of the recent coup attempt may not be much of a surprise. [Saying Erdoğan may have goals along the lines of creating another “longterm Caliphate” or “Ottoman Empire again,” Prince believes the claims that the attempted coup by elements of the military may have been genuine in terms of their claiming to stand for democracy and liberty for the nation. He added that Erdoğan is “definitely making an Islamization” of Turkish society again.  At the same time, Prince agreed that it was fair to say Erdoğan is running a   “Islamist” government, citing “evidence of Turkey supporting hardcore Islamists and radical elements in Libya,” as well as in Syria and Iraq. Erdoğan is “chopping away” at elements of civil society in Turkey, according to Prince. He said the attempted coup was “a poorly planned and poorly executed coup attempt done against Erdoğan, a guy who’s gone to war kind of against his own military over his past dozen years at the center of power there. ” He added that “he has replaced dozens of generals and other ranking officers, trying to strip away power from the military and trying to move towards a more Muslim   nation. ” Breitbart News Saturday airs weekly on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125, from 10 a. m. to 1 p. m.
