Nintendo isn’t particularly happy about seeing unlicensed recreations of its characters speeding around on public roads and has decided to sue a   company for infringing upon its intellectual property. [A Japanese company by the name of Marika Co. lets customers rent “public road”   that bear a distinct resemblance to a certain   plumber and his friends.  It looks like a pretty    case. The   rental service provides Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad costumes to its customers. There isn’t even any effort to differentiate the costumes from Nintendo’s legally owned characters. And if that wasn’t galling enough, Nintendo thinks it’s pretty clear that “Marika” is meant as an abbreviation of “Mario Kart. ” Even “Nintondo” puts in more effort when ripping off Nintendo’s games. There has been no official response to Nintendo’s claim.
