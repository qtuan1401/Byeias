’  ’ ’   The  ’ ”   And naturally, lawmakers are furious about it. Here’s a statement   from Senator Ron Wyden ( ): ” ’ that a number of members of the Senate   Finance Committee sent to the CMS Inspector General last   month. What the senators wanted to know was whether or not   Mylan manipulated the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) by   classifying EpiPen as a generic drug when it is in fact not. ’ ”   The short answer from CMS that we have now is: Yes, but they’re   not sure by how much yet.  the agency sent to the Senate [emphasis   ours]. ” ”   The reason why misclassification is a big deal is   because   drugs have inflation protections with   Medicaid that generics don’t. Makers of   drugs have to   pay higher rebates to states than generics  —   23. 1% versus 13%.   Also, they have to pay additional rebates if their price   increases rise more than inflation.  ” ’   So by having EpiPen classified as a generic Mylan saved   itself a bunch of money. Back in 2009, Mylan paid a $124 million   fine for misclassifying its drugs and   rebates this   way.  ’ ’   From 2011 to 2015, government spending on EpiPen increased 463%   from $86 million to $487 million,  This table was included in their letter. ’ ’  ’ ’   Now it looks like the government may want a chunk of that back. ’ ”   Mylan came under fire in August when it increased the price of a   pack of two EpiPens to $608. The pack cost around $100 when Mylan   bought the drug back in 2007. The company’s CEO, Heather Bresch,   was on Capitol Hill answering for this last month, but so far   lawmakers have in no way been mollified.  ” ’   In the House, Representatives Jason Chaffetz ( ) and Elijah   Cummings ( ) are still demanding more information about how   much Mylan actually makes off EpiPens, for one thing. They   demanded more information from the company earlier this week. ’ ’   So just add this to a list of huge problems for the company. ’ ’     ’
