While media outlets focused on the collapse of Speaker Paul Ryan’s healthcare bill, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) quietly vetoed legislation that would have granted women immediate approval to carry guns for   against domestic abusers. [The bill, HB 1852, would make exceptions in the issuance of concealed carry permits, “[providing] that for a period of 45 days after the issuance of a protective order the individual seeking the protective order may lawfully carry a concealed weapon. ”  McAuliffe vetoed the legislation on March 24, claiming HB 1852 weakens the “Commonwealth’s gun safety laws” and “perpetuates the dangerous fiction that the victims of domestic violence will be safer by arming themselves. ” Breitbart News reported the story of Carol Bowne, a New Jersey woman who had gotten a protective order against her   and applied for state’s permission to have a gun for  . The   process of getting permission to have a gun was still playing out when a defenseless Bowne was stabbed to death by her   on June 3, 2015. Fast forward to the state of Kentucky in May 2016, where a man violated a protective order, went to his  ’s house, and was later discovered lying in the grass with multiple gunshot wounds. His former girlfriend was armed and handled his breach of the protective order accordingly. McAuliffe’s veto makes tragic stories like Bowne’s more likely and   stories like the one in Kentucky less probable.
