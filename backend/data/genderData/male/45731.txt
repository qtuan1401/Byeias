’’ ’Inspired by teenage Elon Musk, I .’ ’Long before the SpaceX and Tesla CEO accumulated  he challenged himself  to see if he had what it takes to be an entrepreneur.’ ’”When I first came to North America  —   I was in Canada when I was 17  —   and just to sort of see what it takes to live, I tried to live on $1 a day, which I was able to do,” he explained to astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson .’ ’”I was like, Oh, okay. If I can live for a dollar a day  —   at least from a   standpoint  —   it’’s pretty easy to earn $30 in a month, so I’’ll probably be okay. ”’ ’To replicate the challenge, I adjusted for inflation  —   $1 in 1988, when Musk was 17, is the equivalent $2 today  —   and set aside $62 for the   month of January.’ ’After completing what I coined the ”,” I reached out to the man himself, asking about any guidelines he set prior to the experiment and letting him know that he inspired my $   January food budget.’ ’He wrote back in an email:’ ”It’s nice to hear he doesn’t recommend the arduous challenge.” ”As for his reference to 1990, yes, I caught that. I did the entire month based on the value of a 1988 dollar  —   and while I was not about to   it, I couldn’t help but check the value of a 1990 dollar. It’s equivalent to $1. 81 today, meaning I would have had a budget of $56. 11 for the month.” ”Since I actually came in under budget at $60. 93, the difference boils down to a few eggs and sweet potatoes. I have a little food left over   so I’m confident the point still stands.”
