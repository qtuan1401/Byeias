A Muslim journalist has become the first woman to pose in a hijab in this month’s issue of Playboy magazine.[    Noor Tagouri appears in the magazine’s October 2016 issue, fully clothed and wearing the traditional Muslim head covering, as part of the publication’s Renegades series, an issue dedicated to   in their respective industries.  “As a badass activist with a passion for demanding change and asking the right questions, accompanied by    looks, Tagouri forces us to ask ourselves why we have such a hard time wrapping our minds around a young woman who consciously covers her head and won’t take no for an answer,” the feature accompanying Tagouri in the magazine reads.  It’s here! I’m honored to share that @Playboy has named me a 2016 #Renegade and has featured me in their piece!! *LINK IN BIO* 📸: @gokateshoot, A photo posted by Noor Tagouri (@ntagouri) on Sep 22, 2016 at 6:55am PDT,  Tagouri, who graduated from the University of Maryland and now works as an   reporter for video news network Newsy, told Playboy that she doesn’t pay attention to those who criticize her appearance. “It’s just negative energy and unhealthy,” she told the magazine. “I make sure to keep a great circle of people around me who keep me grounded. ” The journalist also said that wearing a hijab while working often encourages sensitive sources to trust her. “To be honest, I think being a hijabi Muslim woman, helped me gain that trust. I know what it’s like to have the narrative of our community be skewed and exploited in the media,” she told Playboy. “I was like, ‘Hey, I know what it’s like to be misrepresented in the media. I won’t do that to you. I want to tell your story because it’s important and deserves justice. ’” Tagouri’s photo spread comes a little less than a year after Playboy announced the most significant change in its   history, that it would stop publishing nude photos in its magazines. The spread also comes as the hijab has begun to penetrate some fashion circles. Earlier this month,    Indonesian designer Anniesa Hasibuan debuted the first collection to feature all models wearing hijabs at New York Fashion Week.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
