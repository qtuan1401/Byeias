 (CNN) In a   season 14 finale, Nick Fradiani was anointed the latest ”American Idol.” But was anybody paying attention? On Monday, Fox announced that it would cancel the   series after its 15th season airs next year. The timing seems about right: Not only have ”Idol’s” ratings been declining for years, apparently it doesn’t make the hearts of Internet clickers beat faster either, with the show trending on only some services Thursday morning. It’s quite a comedown for what once was the No. 1 program in television, leading the   ratings for eight years in a row and giving birth to countless frantic live blogs.  Nevertheless, the show must go on    for now, at least. Fradiani, from Guilford, Connecticut, squared off against White House, Tennessee’s, Clark Beckham for the championship.  The three judges    Harry Connick Jr. Jennifer Lopez and Keith Urban    chipped in with a performance of Rihanna’s ”Diamonds,” and other performers gave the show an awards   glow. Among them: Steven Tyler, who performed his country song ”Love Is Your Name” Janelle Monae, who sang ”Yoga” and Michael McDonald, who lent vocals to his old Doobie Brothers hit, ”Takin’ It to the Streets.” Fradiani closed the show with his debut single, ”Beautiful Life,” and another season was in the books.
