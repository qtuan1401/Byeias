You won’t play in the playoffs. ” This was the ultimatum posed to a coed   basketball team on Friday night before the penultimate game of its season. The team members’ response was swift and unanimous: They would sacrifice their record to maintain team unity. Squad goals, indeed. [NJ. com] ______ • The heart shape may have been inspired by the seed pods of an ancient,   plant known as Silphium.

[The Outline] ______ • Rhonda McCoy is the most unlikely of heroes. Ms. McCoy, the food service director for the public schools of Cabell County, W.

I felt like I belonged there. ” Those are the words of Joe Maldonado, 9, on his first meeting as a member of the Maplewood Cub Scouts in New Jersey.

We caught up with them in our continuing Committed series. ______ • Dog break: Marvel up close at the wrinkles of Glitter the Chinese   stare into the eyes of Duo the Australian shepherd, or see the Westminster Dog Show through the eyes of a pup in our 360 video.
