’  ’ ’   1969 marked the beginning of a revolution in the watch industry. ’ ’   That was the year    introduced the Seiko   35Q, the first watch to be   powered by a electrical oscillator regulated by a quartz crystal. ’ ’   It took nearly ten years and teams of engineers to develop. But   as soon as it was released it immediately ushered in what is   refer to by people in the watch industry as”the Quartz   Crisis.”  ’ ’   Up until Seiko’’s Astron, Swiss watchmakers were king. In 1970   there were over 1, 500 Swiss watchmakers. But by the height of the   ”crisis” in 1983, their numbers stood at a mere 600. ’ ’   Ultimately the rise of the Quartz watch pushed Swiss watch   companies into the luxury market. ’ ’   According to Andrea Squatrito, the founder of RE Analytics,    new technology is once   again drawing a battlefield for Swiss   watchmakers. Squatrito’’s report, ”Rolex: An industry under   threat” outlines how the rise of smart watches may pose a   new threat for Swiss watch brands.  ’ ’   Squatrito’’s report identifies two main business segments for   Rolex: ”People who are buying watches in the 2, 500   to 11, 000 range and people buying watches in the   23, 000 to 33, 000 range.” Together   these two segments account for 83% of the company’’s business. ’ ”   According to Squatrito, Rolex’s lower end watches, which make up   45% of the company’s costumer base, are at risk of being   challenged by   wearables like the . ” ’   ”There are touch points in the lower end of luxury watches and   the higher end of wearables,” Squatrito said. ’ ’   ”The Apple Watch hasn’’t reached its full potential in terms of        there are signals that Swiss watch makers may   soon see a large portion of their business threatened,” Squatrito   added. ’ ’   Squatrito does not think that the end is nigh for Rolex and other   Swiss watchmakers. But he does think that increased competition   from premium smart watches will force them to make big changes. ’ ’   ”For instance, Rolex may follow the lead of fashion companies   like Chanel and expand into   products to make up for the   losses brought on by wearables,” he concluded. ’
