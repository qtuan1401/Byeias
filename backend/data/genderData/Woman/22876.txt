A review in the Japan Times of the documentary film “Clinton Cash,” based on Peter Schweizer’s bestselling book and new graphic novel of the same name, argues that “anyone who’s all comfy with the idea that voting for Clinton as the ‘lesser of two evils’ really needs to watch ‘Clinton Cash’ first. ”[“Clinton Cash” takes a simple approach: follow the money. The film investigates the vast flow of cash to the Clinton Foundation, and how that could be diverted to   companies who  —   surprise!  —   often rewarded the Clintons personally with   speaking fees.  The picture it paints is not pretty, one where   trumps political principle every time. Human rights violators, rainforest   contractors, sweatshop owners, Keystone XL pipeline supporters, even Russian uranium mining interests connected to Vladimir Putin  —   their money is all good with the Clintons, and mysteriously, the donors always seem to get satisfactory resolution of some issue or contract they had pending with the U. S. government. Coincidence? Not when you start connecting the dots. Read the rest here. Watch the film “Clinton Cash” free online here.
