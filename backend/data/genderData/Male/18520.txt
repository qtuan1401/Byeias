The Ugandan man shot and killed by El Cajon police on Tuesday was twice ordered to be deported from the U. S. “because of drug and firearm convictions,” respectively. [The man  —      Alfred Okwera Olango  —   was shot and killed after allegedly “taking what appeared to be a shooting stance” and pointing a   object at an officer. The Los Angeles Times reported the object was later discovered to be a “vape smoking device. ”  The Times now reports that immigration officials tried to depart Olango at least twice over the convictions. After failing to deport him, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released Olango in 2003. and he was then “placed under supervision due to a Supreme Court ruling that forbids the detention of foreign nationals with final deportation orders for more than six months if they cannot be deported ‘within the reasonably foreseeable future. ’” In 2009, after Olango served time in prison for a firearms conviction, ICE again tried to have him deported. But ICE said, according to the Times, “Once again the attempts were unsuccessful, leading to Mr. Olango’s release from ICE custody on an order of supervision. ” ICE observed, “This is often due to a foreign government’s refusal to accept the repatriation of its nationals. ” Olango’s brother reportedly complains that Olango is being perceived as a dangerous criminal  —   a perception reinforced by a still image of him pointing the object at police on Tuesday. His brother said, “They don’t have the right paintbrush. You can’t paint the right painting without the right paintbrush. They haven’t spoke with anyone who knows him, anyone who knows his journeys. ” Protests in El Cajon, near San Diego, have continued for three nights, turning violent in the last two nights.
