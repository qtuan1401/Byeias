’  ’ ’   Morgan Stanley is pulling away from archrival Goldman Sachs in a   key business. ’ ’   The US bank on Wednesday reported . That followed   Goldman Sachs  on Tuesday. ’ ’   And a comparison of the two banks in a key business line  —     equities sales and trading  —   shows that Morgan Stanley is getting   one over on its rival. ’ ’   Morgan Stanley reported equity sales and trading net revenues of   $2. 1 billion, down from $2. 3 billion a year ago. ’ ’   The bank said the drop reflected ”reduced volumes and levels of   activity in Asia, partially offset by better performance in   Europe and the US.” ’ ’   At Goldman Sachs, equities revenues came in at $1. 75 billion,   down 12% from a year ago. ’ ’   That means that Morgan Stanley generated close to $400 million   more in equities than Goldman Sachs  —   a sizable gap. ’ ”   It’s also the most ground the firm has gained over Goldman Sachs   since the first quarter of 2015, when the roles were reversed and   Goldman’s fixed income, currencies, and commodities revenues   slightly surpassed those of Morgan Stanley. ” ’  ’ ’   Of course, results can vary from quarter to quarter, and it may   be too soon to say whether a real trend is taking place. ’ ”   But Morgan Stanley has been open about the fact that equities is   the firm’s   franchise. Ted Pick, who had been running   the business, was promoted to oversee the entire sales and   trading division, including fixed income, last year. ”
