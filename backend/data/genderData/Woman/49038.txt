’  ’ ”   Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine says   Hillary Clinton will be his first female boss if she’s elected   president. ” ”   The Virginia senator and attorney attempted to recall when he   last worked for a woman during an  with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. ” ’   ”Other than supervising attorneys on occasion, this will be the   first time I’’ve had a female boss,” Kaine said on the program   airing Tuesday night. ’ ’   For his part, Kaine would also be making history as the first man   in the US to serve as vice president to a woman     . ’ ’   Kaine told Maddow he is eager to play a supporting role for ”a   woman who’’s going to make history, to a president who will   preside over the centennial of women getting the right to vote.” ’ ’’ ’   ”Strong men should definitely support strong women,” he said   speaking to the changing gender roles that would happen in the   White House should Clinton be elected. ’ ’   The message echoed with Kaine’’s  with David Axelrod on Monday’’s ”The Axe Files”   podcast  —   produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute   of Politics, in which the Virginia senator narrated what flashed   through his mind when Clinton asked him to be her running mate. ’ ’     . ..I’ve been in politics for 22 years; this is my ninth race.     In all the previous eight races, I’ve been the guy with my name     on the ballot, my name on the bumper sticker and the yard sign.     And I’ve had all these strong women supporting me: campaign     managers, Cabinet secretaries, agency heads; the voters that we     get are more women than men.   ’ ’     And I remember thinking, “Wow, I’m going to have the chance now     to notbe the top of the ticket. I’m going to be a     strong man supporting the first strong woman to be     president of the United States. ” And as important as it is to     normalize that a woman can be president, it’s also important to     normalize that strong men can support a woman as president.   ’
