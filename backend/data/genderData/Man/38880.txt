 (CNN) A madcap proposal for a concrete house inside a cliff went viral last year    and now it’s set to be built, thanks to the internet. Dutch practice OPA designed a home wedged in a mountaintop, topped by an infinity pool that doubles as a skylight for the underground lair.  In the wake of the media interest, a client who wanted to make the concept a reality came forward and the project will now be realized 1, 600 meters (5249 feet) above sea level on a cliff in Lebanon. Channeling his inner Kim Kardashian, OPA     Ando Vassilou told ArchDaily the plan was to ”break the internet.” ”We wanted to create a sensation in every possible way and through this project to actually showcase our platform this project describes fully our aesthetics and design philosophy,” he added.
