’  ’ ’   The Los Angeles Rams announced on Thursday that they hired   Washington Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay as their new   head coach. ’ ’   McVay, 30, is now the youngest head coach in NFL history  —   a   title previously held by Lane Kiffin, whom the Raiders hired in   2007. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tBoom! Welcome to Los Angeles!  ’ ’   In their first season back in Los Angeles, the Rams stumbled to a     season and fired head coach Jeff Fisher after a   start.   Their rookie quarterback, Jared Goff, struggled during his first   season as a pro  —   and by all accounts, McVay was hired explicitly   to make Goff better. ’ ”   In August,  called McVay a prodigy. The grandson of longtime   49ers executive John McVay, Sean graduated from Miami (Ohio) in   2008. After some time under Jon Gruden’s wing, he was hired in   2010 by Mike Shanahan in Washington as an offensive quality   control coach. ” ’   From there, he quickly worked his way up to an assistant   receivers coach and then to tight ends coach. When Shanahan was   fired in 2014 and replaced by Jay Gruden, McVay became offensive   coordinator. In 2015, he started calling the offensive plays. ’ ’   According to The MMQB, McVay is beloved by both his fellow   coaches and his players. ’ ”   That won’t, of course, make his first head coaching gig any   easier. After trading up to take Goff first overall last year,   the Rams have very few high draft picks this season and a dearth   of talent on the offensive side of the ball. The defense is   stronger, and  on Thursday that McVay would try to recruit   veteran defensive coordinator Wade Phillips to lead that unit. ” ”   In the end, it will take a few more seasons for the Rams return   to relevancy. But in the meantime, with a    coach,   they’ll certainly be interesting. ”
