She has freezing gait, dyskinesia,   symptomology,” expressed Shkreli during a recent Periscope livestream.  “I actually don’t think she had a stroke, because if she had a stroke we would see serious neurological defects,” he explained. “People with stroke have, as you know, cardinal symptoms like slurred speech or a difficulty walking  …     They require   physical therapy to recover, so I think that in essence, what’s happened is that she has Parkinson’s disease. ” “I think she had an embolism, had the clot dissolved, she probably had some kind of concussion, [though] concussions aren’t responsible for this kind of symptomology,” he continued. “I’m not a physician, I’m not a neurologist, but I have been in pharmaceuticals for fifteen years.
