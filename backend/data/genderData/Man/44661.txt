’  ’ ’   People are ready to cash in on the fiasco that was Fyre   Festival.  ’ ’   After the   music festival  —   which people paid up to   $12, 000 to attend  —   devolved into a ”complete disaster,”   with   tents, canceled musical acts, and guests stranded   at airports, some people are taking legal action. ’ ’   At least two lawsuits have been filed against   the organizers, Ja Rule and tech entrepreneur Billy   McFarland, accusing them of fraud, breach of contract, breach of   covenant of good faith, and negligent misrepresentation.  ’ ’   Now, personal injury lawyer Philip DeBerard seems to be preparing   for another lawsuit, seeking compensation for festival goers who   lost money on tickets, airfare or other injuries. He has   —   and he has a horror movie     video to match.  ’ ’   The video, which is embedded at the top of DeBerard’’s site,   starts with images of what the Fyre Festival was   advertised to be  —   straight from the festival’’s promotional   video. Then, in a ”Ring”  moment, the screen fuzzes over,   with words flashing: ”WASN’’T WHAT IT SEEMED.”  ’ ’   Footage flashes across the screen of people running in the   darkness, set to screeching music. Dark photos pop up: a sad   cheese sandwich, disaster tents, a shabby concierge shack. Tweets   appear on the screen of attendees reporting ”refugee” treatment,   chaos on festival grounds, and people fighting for food.  ’ ’   Then, a scream pierces through. ”FIRE FESTIVAL. HAPPENING RIGHT   NOW” the screen reads.  ’ ”   Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem that DeBerard made the faux horror   movie trailer himself. The video is uploaded to the YouTube   page of women’s website Galore.  ” ’ ’ ’     ’ ’People are ready to cash in on the fiasco that. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
