Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( ) spoke Saturday on MSNBC about the deportation raids sending families here in the United States illegally back to their Central American countries.  According to Gutierrez, illegal immigration is “really an issue of human rights” for the immigrants to come into the country. He also said U. S. laws allow immigrants to seek refuge and asylum. “This is really an issue of human rights and the rights of these people to come here. I know as the American public looks at them, remember they didn’t come here illegally. We have laws on our books that allow people to come and seek refuge and asylum in the United States of America, so they are using the laws of the United States of America. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
