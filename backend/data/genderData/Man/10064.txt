Friday, on CNN’s “Inside Politics,” the Atlantic’s Molly Ball reacted to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s ( ) prediction that the House’s passage of the revised version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) could help Democrats take back the majority in the House by saying Pelosi has a history of incorrect predictions on House control.  Ball said, “We also, I don’t think, should ever take Nancy Pelosi’s word for what’s going to happen in the House, because I recall she predicted Democrats were going to take back the House in 2012, in 2014, and in 2016, so she always makes that prediction. ” (  NTK) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN,
