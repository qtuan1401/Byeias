Conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza discussed the history of the Democratic Party and his new film Hillary’s America with Breitbart News daily host Stephen K. Bannon today on SiriusXM radio, calling it akin to a criminal gang.  “I begin to look at the Democratic Party and Progressivism not just as a movement of ideas but as a movement to seize wealth and power  —   to get its hands on the wealth of America and exercise power over other people’s lives in the same way a criminal gang does,” said D’Souza. “We’re telling the story of American politics in a way that shows many of the crimes of the Democratic party, of Obama and Hillary, are rooted in things this party has been doing to American and to poor people for a long time,” he added. He also said he would like to release the film the weekend of the Democratic convention. The entire interview can be heard below. Breitbart News Daily airs weekdays from   EST on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125. LISTEN:
