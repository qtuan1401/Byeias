Four   poker pros facing off against the Libratus AI in a       Texas Hold’em competition pulled back from an early   $193, 000 deficit with big wins on days four and six, bringing the   deficit down to to $51, 000, with one human, Dong King, up   $33, 000. ” ’   ”It took us a while to study and get an understanding of what was   going on,” one of the pros, Jason Les, wrote in an email. ’ ’   But then the bot started winning again and big.
