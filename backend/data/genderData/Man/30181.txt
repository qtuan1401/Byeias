Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones has had her personal computer hacked, with the hackers posting Jones’s personal information obtained from her iCloud account. [It is understood that the photos, which included images of Jones naked, as well as copies of her passport and driving license, were released on Jones’s personal website, which was taken down shortly after the images were published.  Jones temporarily left Twitter earlier this summer, citing online harassment. Jones, who had a lead role in the   remake of Ghostbusters and is also a cast member of the comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live, petitioned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about her critics soon after, the platform permanently banned Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos. Yiannopoulos released a statement on Facebook in response to the hack. “I was distressed to hear that Leslie Jones has been hacked and naked pictures of her have been posted online. I know we had our differences after my review of Ghostbusters but I wish her all the best during what must be a very traumatic experience,” he wrote. It is far from the first time that a celebrity has been targeted by hackers. Figures such as Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Avril Lavigne all had private images exposed after a large scale hack on their iCloud accounts back in 2014. Jones has not yet commented on the incident.   You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net,
