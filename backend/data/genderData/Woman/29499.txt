A record    U. S. residents speak a foreign language at home, with the   languages including Arabic and Urdu, a new study reveals. [The Center for Immigration Studies, surveying data the Census Bureau released from its 2015 American Community Survey, found 64. 7 million U. S. residents spoke a language other than English at home, with data indicating that    public school students speaking a foreign language at home.  This has huge implications for the future of public education in the United States. As Breitbart News previously reported, American taxpayers carry the costs of educating nearly four million   students who do no speak English. Most of the   speakers in American schools perform at extremely low levels while costing taxpayers roughly $59. 8 billion per year: As the Center notes, “half of the growth in   speakers since 2010 is among those born in the United States. ” And “overall, 44 percent (28. 5 million) of those who speak a language other than English at home are U. S.” meaning these nationwide problems will only worsen over time. Eleven percent of U. S. residents spoke a language other than English at home in 1980. Only 35 years later, that share increased to 21. 5 percent of the U. S. population. Arabic speakers increased dramatically in the U. S. with a 34 percent increase from 2010 to 2015: The largest percentage increases from 2010 to 2015 were among speakers of Arabic (up 34 percent) Hindi (up 33 percent) Urdu (up 24 percent) Chinese (up 19 percent) French Creole (up 16 percent) Gujarati (up 14 percent) and Persian (up 13 percent). Hindi and Gujarati are languages of India Urdu is spoken in Pakistan French Creole is spoken in Haiti and Persian is the national language of Iran. The largest numerical increases from 2010 to 2015 were among speakers of Spanish (up 3. 1 million) Chinese (up 525, 000) Arabic (up 292, 000) Hindi (up 203, 000) Tagalog (up 163, 000) French Creole (up 117, 000) and Urdu (up 92, 000). Tagalog is spoken in the Philippines  …     States with the largest share of their populations speaking a foreign language at home in 2015 were: California (45 percent) Texas (35 percent) New Mexico (34 percent) New York (31 percent) New Jersey (31 percent) Nevada (30 percent) Florida (29 percent) Arizona (27 percent) Hawaii (26 percent) Illinois (23 percent) and Massachusetts (23 percent). Nevada saw its share of   speakers explode from 1980 to 2015 with a 1, 005 percent increase. Georgia and North Carolina saw their share increase 916 percent and 729 percent. Virginia, where 23 percent of Northern Virginia residents are foreigners and 68 percent of the state’s   population is clustered around the D. C. Beltway, saw its share rise 460 percent. Florida’s share increased 356 percent. North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida are   swing states in presidential elections. Progressives deliberately craft immigration policy to disenfranchise Americans: As President Obama told Latino audience in Florida last year, there will be a “President Rodriguez” “someday” thanks in part to him unilaterally granting illegal aliens amnesty. There were 40 million Spanish speakers, 3. 3 million Chinese speakers, 1. 7 million Tagalog speakers, and 1. 2 million Arabic speakers in the U. S. in 2015. Forty percent of those who primarily speak a foreign language at home also told the Census Bureau they don’t speak English very well. As Breitbart News previously reported, current extreme immigration levels will by 2060 import 78. 2 million   people.
