Sunday on CNN’s “State Of The Union,”  while discussing the FBI reopening the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Sen. Al Franken ( )  said “I think we’ll have hearing and I think we’ll get into the rogue element of the FBI, trying to affect the election. ”  Franken said, “I think what’s troubling, we’ve heard out of the FBI, I think it was troubling that he put that vague letter out days before the election, even more troubling is what we’ve heard from sort of the rogue elements within the FBI, seemingly tipping off former Mayor Giuliani that something was up and also  —   I mean, it just seems like  —   that’s not the FBI. That’s not what the FBI  supposed to do. So I’m on the Judiciary Committee. I’m sure we’ll have hearing and I’m sure FBI Director Comey will be before us. And I think he should answer questions about this. He should be able to control the FBI. He is the director. What has been happening there has been a little hinckey, I think. ” He continued, “I think we’ll have hearing and I think we’ll get into the rogue element of the FBI, trying to affect the election and seems to be responding to just right wing books and starting investigations based on that kind of  —   you know, that kind of propaganda that we’ve seen before. If you’re director of the FBI, that’s disturbing. You should be able to prevent that from happening. that’s part of being a leading organization, is to keep that organization on its mission. This is so apart and separate. Very, very important questions to be asking Director Comey. ” He added, “I think there should be hearings. I’m certain there will be hearings in the judiciary committee in this matter. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
