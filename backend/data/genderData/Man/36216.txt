 (CNN) A Democratic National Committee employee died this weekend after he was shot in Northwest Washington. Seth Rich, 27, suffered multiple gunshot wounds early Sunday morning in Washington’s Bloomingdale neighborhood, according to law enforcement officials.  D. C. police said officers who had been patrolling the area responded to the sound of shots fired, ultimately finding Rich at the scene both ”conscious and breathing.” He was then transported to an area hospital, where police said he ”succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead.”  Rich worked as voter expansion data director for the DNC since 2014, the DNC confirmed. A 2011 graduate of Creighton University, Rich’s resume is filled with various jobs in Democratic politics and political consulting. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz mourned Rich’s death in a statement released Monday. ”Our hearts are broken with the loss of one of our DNC family members over the weekend,” she said. ”Seth Rich was a dedicated, selfless public servant who worked tirelessly to protect the most sacred right we share as Americans    the right to vote. He saw the great potential of our nation and believed that, together, we can make the world a better place. He was a joy to have as a member of our team, and his talents, intelligence and enthusiasm will be deeply missed by the many friends, colleagues and coworkers who worked by his side in service to the highest ideals of our democracy.” The D. C. Metropolitan Police Department in Washington is offering a reward of up to $25, 000 for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual or individuals behind the shooting.
