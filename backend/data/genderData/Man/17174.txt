Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton argued, “we don’t need to make America great. America has never stopped being great.   …     Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers” in a speech after winning Saturday’s South Carolina Democratic primary.  Hillary stated, “[T]omorrow, this campaign goes national. We are going to compete for every vote, in every state. We are not taking anything, and we’re not taking anyone, for granted. ” She further said, “I am so looking forward to working with the Congressman [Jim Clyburn  )] to make the changes and continue the progress, that we can build, on the record and accomplishments of President Obama. ” She later added, “[W]e’re going to start by working together with more love and kindness in our hearts, and more respect for each other, even when we disagree. Despite what you hear, we don’t need to make America great. America has never stopped being great. But we do need to make America whole again. Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers. ” Hillary later said, “America isn’t a single issue country, my friends. We need more than a plan for the biggest banks. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
