Monday on his radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh argued some Republicans would be willing to vote for Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton over the eventual GOP presidential nominee if that means holding on to their power.  Limbaugh argued that if Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) turns out to be the nominee, the   Republican establishment would be willing to take a defeat if that is necessary for them to maintain power. Partial transcript as follows: If the guy gets close to 1, 237 but still has the majority in delegates, and they take the nomination away from him, we’re gonna lose the voters, right?  What’s gonna happen?  Folks  …     (sigh) Patience. Patience, Rush.  The Republican establishment is prepared to vote for Hillary Clinton if it means holding onto their fiefdoms. The Republican Party is prepared, if Ted Cruz gets the nomination, to not care whether he wins or loses.  In fact, if Ted Cruz is the nominee and loses the general, the party will be happy.  They’ll be able to blame the loss on conservatives and conservatism and be done  —   once and for all  —   with conservatism in the party.  The party’s primary objective is   not winning the White House in this cycle. Given the vagaries of this cycle, the Republican Party’s primary objective is maintaining its own power structure and base for the current people that occupy it.
