WARNING: LANGUAGE]  Fox Sports 1’s Clay Travis hosted a show on live streaming app Periscope Thursday. In the show, Travis blasted Lena Dunham for saying sushi is “cultural appropriation. ” “If you don’t know who this b**** Lena Dunham is, she’s the girl who does ‘Girls.’ It’s an awful show on HBO. She’s like a wunderkind director because she’s famous and has all these friends and everything else. The show f****** sucks, and I hate this b****,” Travis explained.
