During his Friday appearance on Breitbart News Daily, Dr. Herbert London of the London Center for Policy Research chastised Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers for refusing to stand for the national anthem. [“He has the right to express his views about America,” said London, who added:  But if oppression means you get a $19 million salary, you’re raised in an    white firm, and you’re given every privilege this country can confer, and you’re telling me you’re oppressed? I don’t understand that kind of oppression. I never will. I would turn my back on you. “If you cannot bring attention to the flag of this country, then it seems to me there’s something fundamentally wrong with you,” he contended. He went on to say: And I would say the red in that flag represents the blood soaking the soil of Normandy, and Belgium, and Inchon, and Fallujah, and Helmand province. There is no question Americans have given their lives so that you can stand up and act like a fool, or sit down and act like a fool. “My feeling about this is that every single time we have the opportunity to repudiate people like Colin Kaepernick, we should take the opportunity to do so and to remind them that there are so many who gave their lives so that flag will fly,” London said.  “I believe in America, and I believe in that flag. It seems to me that those who do not, even though they want to express themselves, should be called what they are: stupid people who do not understand the antecedents that led to the creation of this country,” he concluded. Dr. Herbert London is a   of The Encyclopedia of Militant Islam, which he described as “giving you some sense of why we’re fighting this battle, and what the battle is all about, including a kind of encyclopedic examination of 44 of the terrorist groups that are challenging the United States today. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
