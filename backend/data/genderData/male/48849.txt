’  ’ ’   In a very real way, the future of the PlayStation is the future   of Sony itself.  ’ ’   In July,  that a whopping 78% of the  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   And so, Sony is betting big on unproven markets  —   in the form of   the PlayStation Vue live TV streaming service and the  which comes out this   week  —   to make sure that the PlayStation stays relevant, no   matter which way the winds of change blow.  ’ ”   It’s a risky game, but a necessary one. At stake is   the future of Sony itself. ” ’   Microsoft has been slowly but steadily building key Xbox   features into Windows 10, and making games like ”Gears of War 4”   and ”Forza Horizon 3” . It means that if you have a Windows 10 PC, you   get access to many of the best Xbox games. No matter where you   play your games, Microsoft wins. ’ ”   It’s a great idea. But Sony’s big problem is that it just doesn’t   have Microsoft’s reach.  ” ’   While Sony has some services and features that you can use on a   PC or Mac, like streaming classic games with  Microsoft has Windows itself.  ’ ’  ’ ”   Sony  but it doesn’t make Windows. In this   regard, Microsoft holds all the cards. ” ’   If Microsoft builds Xbox features into Windows 10, and starts to   sell Xbox games right from the Windows Store app market, then all   PC manufacturers have little choice but to go along with it.   It gives Microsoft an   audience. ’ ’   And while Sony has tried to get into portable gaming, where   Nintendo has found most of its recent success, the PlayStation   Vita handheld console is widely recognized as a flop. Meanwhile,   many younger and more casual players are doing more of their   gaming on smartphones, anyway, which has . ’ ’   Without any existing platforms on which to build the future of   PlayStation, Sony is forced to look elsewhere to keep the brand   strong and relevant amid pressure from smartphones on the low end   and the revitalized Microsoft on the high end. ’ ”   That’s where PlayStation VR and Vue come in. ” ”   Sony says it’s been working on PlayStation VR, originally   codenamed Project Morpheus, since at least 2010. Regardless of   the timeline, Sony is in the market at the exact right time:   Facebook, Google, and lots more tech companies  and are building their   own headsets to get in the market. ” ’   What Sony has, that those other companies don’’t, are deep and     relationships with video game developers.   Anticipated games like ”Batman: Arkham VR” and the   forthcoming ”Resident Evil 7” were built with the PlayStation VR   in mind. ’ ’  ’ ”   But if you want PlayStation VR, you need a PlayStation 4. It’ll   work with any PlayStation 4 console, past or present, but you   need to own one. ” ”   It’s a risky bet, to be sure: Virtual reality is still a very   young, and very unproven market. Sony could be pouring millions   into developing and marketing PlayStation VR, only to find   consumer interest isn’t there. The payoff, though, would be   making the PlayStation VR, and by extension the PlayStation VR, a   . ” ’   Similar, but different, is the PlayStation Vue TV streaming   service, which lets you buy bundles of TV channels and watch them   on your PlayStation 4, iOS device, Amazon Fire Stick, and most   anything else except a Windows PC or a Mac. While   it works across devices, the intent is clearly to make the   PlayStation 4 your media hub. ’ ”   In all cases, Sony’s strategy hinges on making sure you buy a   PlayStation 4. For Sony, there’s no Plan B. If the PlayStation   falters, which it could one day do, so too does its greatest   source of revenue.  ” ”   That leaves Sony in the unenviable position of primarily selling   hardware, as Google, Microsoft, and even Apple all shift their   business more towards   businesses. Sony is   doing that, too, with Vue and the premium PlayStation Plus   membership. But Sony’s 40 million PlayStation 4 owners, its   primary subscriber base, are a blip next to, say, the . ” ’  ’ ”   It’s not an impossible situation for Sony, by any means. It’s not   like the video game console market is going to implode overnight,   and PlayStation is still the leading brand in that market. It’s   entirely possible for Sony to thrive, especially if the   PlayStation VR really takes off and pushes more hardware and game   sales. ” ’   But next year, Microsoft will launch the Project Scorpio     Xbox console. Microsoft promises it’’s the ”most   powerful console ever.” And rumors are swirling that it’’ll   support Facebook’’s Oculus Rift headset out of the box, in   addition to those other Windows 10 goodies.  ’ ”   That, combined with the continued popularity of the smartphone,   has Sony facing pressures like never before. Virtual reality is a   big, risky bet, but it’s also the best chance Sony has to keep   growing as its prospects of becoming a real platform company   shrink.  ”
