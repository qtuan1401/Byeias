Hall of Famers Goose Gossage and Mike Schmidt, along with 2014 AL MVP Mike Trout, argued for maintaining composure and showing respect for the opposition.

And just like Goose and his peers decided that certain things were okay and certain things weren’t, this generation is going to define what the game looks like on those topics. ” The commissioner said of Bautista’s prolonged stare and batflip after his homer in the final game of the 2015 ALDS that “probably on balance it’s good for the game. ” He explained, “If I were a player, I wouldn’t do that. The fact of the matter is what he did did not offend me. ” The players have acted. The commissioner has spoken.
