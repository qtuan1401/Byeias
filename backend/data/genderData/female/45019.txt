’Apple   Steve Wozniak has arguably been called ”The inventor of the personal computer.” But even if you believe that the title belongs to one of the pioneers before him’ ’”Happiness = smiles   frowns,” would be the best thing on my tombstone.’ ’I think that what I did, I didn’’t know it necessarily at the time, is we all don’’t necessarily know. It made a huge impact on the world was the Apple II computer and some early, unusual approaches. Everything was so out of the book and so different than any engineering book, any book on computers could have ever said before. And I go back and I’’m proud of that, I don’’t even understand my designs anymore. I look at them and I say, ”How did that even come out of my own mind? ”’
