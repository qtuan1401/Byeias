’   Pope Francis delivered his Christmas day message on Sunday,   offering hope for ”t ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’   Dear Brothers and Sisters, Happy Christmas! ’ ’   Today the Church once again experiences the wonder of the Blessed   Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph and the shepherds of Bethlehem, as they   contemplate the newborn Child laid in a manger: Jesus, the   Saviour. ’ ’   On this day full of light, the prophetic proclamation resounds: ’ ’   The power of this Child, Son of God and Son of Mary, is not the   power of this world, based on might and wealth; it is the power   of love.  It is the power which created the heavens and the   earth, which gives life to all creation: to minerals, plants and   animals; it is the force which attracts man and woman, and makes   them one flesh, one single existence; it is the power which gives   new birth, pardons faults, reconciles enemies, and transforms   evil into good.  It is the power of God.  This power of   love led Jesus Christ to strip himself of his glory and become   man; it led him to give his life on the cross and to rise from   the dead.  It is the power of service, which inaugurates in   our world the Kingdom of God, a kingdom of justice and   peace.  ’ ’   For this reason, the birth of Jesus was accompanied by the   angels’ song as they proclaimed: ’ ’   Today this message goes out to the ends of the earth to reach all   peoples, especially those scarred by war and harsh conflicts that   seem stronger than the yearning for peace. ’ ’   Peace to men and women in the   land of Syria, where far   too much blood has been spilled.  Above all in the city of   Aleppo, site of the most awful battles in recent weeks, it is   most urgent that assistance and support be guaranteed to the   exhausted civil populace, with respect for humanitarian   law.  It is time for weapons to be still forever, and the   international community to actively seek a negotiated solution,   so that civil coexistence can be restored in the country. ’ ’   Peace to women and men of the beloved Holy Land, the land chosen   and favoured by God.  May Israelis and Palestinians have the   courage and the determination to write a new page of history,   where hate and revenge give way to the will to build together a   future of mutual understanding and harmony.  May Iraq, Libya   and Yemen  —   where their peoples suffer war and the brutality of   terrorism  —   be able once again to find unity and concord.  ’ ’   Peace to the men and women in various parts of Africa, especially   in Nigeria, where fundamentalist terrorism exploits even children   in order to perpetrate horror and death.  Peace in South   Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, so that divisions   may be healed and all people of good will may strive to undertake   the path of development and sharing, preferring the culture of   dialogue to the mindset of conflict. ’ ’   Peace to women and men who to this day suffer the consequences of   the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, where there is urgent need for a   common desire to bring relief to the civil population and to put   into practice the commitments which have been assumed. ’ ’   We implore harmony for the dear people of Colombia, which seeks   to embark on a new and courageous path of dialogue and   reconciliation.  May such courage also motivate the beloved   country of Venezuela to undertake the necessary steps to put an   end to current tensions, and build together a future of hope for   the whole population. ’ ’   Peace to all who, in different areas, are enduring sufferings due   to constant dangers and persistent injustice.  May Myanmar   consolidate its efforts to promote peaceful coexistence and, with   the assistance of the international community, provide necessary   protection and humanitarian assistance to all those who gravely   and urgently need it.  May the Korean peninsula see the   tensions it is experiencing overcome in a renewed spirit of   cooperation. ’ ’ Peace to those who have lost a person dear to them as a   result of brutal acts of terrorism, and to those who have sown   fear and death into the hearts of so many countries and   cities. ’ ’   Peace  —   not merely the word, but a real and concrete peace  —   to   our abandoned and excluded brothers and sisters, to those who   suffer hunger and to all the victims of violence.  Peace to   exiles, migrants and refugees, to all those who in our day are   subject to human trafficking.  Peace to the peoples who   suffer because of the economic ambitions of the few, because of   the sheer greed and the idolatry of money, which leads to   slavery.  Peace to those affected by social and economic   unrest, and to those who endure the consequences of earthquakes   or other natural catastrophes. ’ ’   Peace to the children, on this special day on which God became a   child, above all those deprived of the joys of childhood because   of hunger, wars or the selfishness of adults. ’ ’   Peace on earth to men and women of goodwill, who work quietly and   patiently each day, in their families and in society, to build a   more humane and just world, sustained by the conviction that only   with peace is there the possibility of a more prosperous future   for all. ’ ’   Dear brothers and sisters, ’ ’                 “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given”: he is the   “Prince of peace”.  Let us welcome him! ’ ’ [after the Blessing] ’ ’   To you, dear brothers and sisters, who have gathered in this   Square from every part of the world, and to those in various   countries who are linked to us by radio, television and other   means of communication, I offer my greeting. ’ ’   On this day of joy, we are all called to contemplate the Child   Jesus, who gives hope once again to every person on the face of   the earth.  By his grace, let us with our voices and our   actions give witness to solidarity and peace.  Merry   Christmas to all! ’
