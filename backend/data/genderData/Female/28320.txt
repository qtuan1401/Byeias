The mother of a teenage son who was tortured and murdered by an illegal immigrant broke down in tears Tuesday before a House panel, begging for the government to enforce immigration law. [Laura Wilkerson, the mother of Josh Wilkerson, described in vivid detail the manner in which Hermilo Vildo Moralez, an illegal immigrant, beat, tortured, and eventually killed her son Josh then went to a movie.  In emotional testimony before the House Immigration and Border Subcommittee, Wilkerson expressed frustration that the problem of illegal immigration has not been fixed since the last time she testified before Congress in July 2015. “Nothing has been done about it. We can have hearing after hearing, after hearing, after hearing until there is action we’re just talking,” Wilkerson said. “I see this America government scrambling over themselves to pretend to care about American families and instead you give away every bit of America to people who have broken our laws entering this country,” she added. “Then on to break other laws. ” Wilkerson addressed the opening comments of the Democrats on the panel, arguing that the fear of being deported is nothing compared to losing a child to torture and death. “You want to know what fear is? When somebody reaches into your house and grabs your littlest kid and tortures them. You’re afraid of everything for a long time. I could care less about the fear that they put themselves in. I didn’t bring my kid across a border,” she said, noting if she sent him across the border alone  —   as in the case of the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have entered the U. S. illegally in recent year  —   she would be charged with child neglect. “I did not put my kid in harms way when he went to school that day,” she said, in reference to the last time she saw her son. “You did, everyone of you is elected by an American. It is time for you to stand in the gap for Americans. ”
