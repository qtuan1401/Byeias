Actor Gérard Depardieu, star of Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac, is featured in a new wristwatch that shows him holding a hunting rifle while kneeling behind a dead deer. [The ad is for Cvstos watches, a   Russian watch.  In the ad, a shot rings out, then the camera finds Depardieu kneeling behind the deer. He says, “To hunt a deer, you always need to be on time. Thanks to my Cvstos, I was on time. ” “And it was his time,” Depardieu adds, while nodding toward the deer and blowing it a kiss.  The Telegraph reports that Depardieu “has been ridiculed” in French media outlets for taking part in the commercial. They indicate that there “was general derision in French news reports on the new advert. ” GQ magazine criticized the ad for “nauseous wordplay and pathetic production quality,” while the newspaper Le Figaro ran a story with the headline, “Gérard Depardieu ‘smokes deers’ in an absurd advert. ” Depardieu was previously criticized by French politicians for becoming “a tax resident of Belgium” in 2012 to avoid France’s excessively high income taxes. He is now a citizen of Russia. AWR Hawkins is Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
