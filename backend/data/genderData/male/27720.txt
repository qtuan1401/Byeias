The production of guns has more than doubled since President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009, amid his frequent demands for more   and fewer guns. [The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has released its annual Firearms Manufacturing and Export Report, which shows that nine million firearms were built and sold in 2014, that’s up from 4. 3 million firearms in 2008.  The March 7 report covers production figures from 2014, and shows that 3, 633, 454 pistols, 744, 047 revolvers, 3, 379, 549 rifles, 935, 411 shotguns, and 358, 165 miscellaneous firearms were manufactured that year. That adds up to a total of 9, 050, 626 firearms. And the 2014 figures, as high as they appear, were down slightly from the 2013 manufacturing total of 10, 844, 792. To really grasp how great a surge the figures from 2014 and 2013 represent, consider the ATF’s report for 2008, when a total of 4, 298, 187 firearms were manufactured. Or the figures from 2007, when a total of 3, 922, 613 guns were manufactured. There is simply no comparison between the two   years and what are the last two years of record for gun manufacturing during Obama’s second term. Breitbart News previously reported that this surge was being fed in late 2015 via the huge growth in demand for guns. According to CNN Money, Smith  Wesson’s sales for the quarter ending January 31, 2016, were up “61. 5%” over the where they were at the end of the same quarter a year before. More broadly, on Black Friday 2015 the FBI conducted 185, 345 background checks, not only breaking the previous record for background checks on a given Black Friday but also breaking the   record for background checks, period. And on March 2 Breitbart News reported FBI figures showing that February 2016 was the tenth straight month of record background checks. So firearm manufacturing continues to surge, but it does so because demand is through the roof.
