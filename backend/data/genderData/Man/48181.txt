’  ’ ’   Do you have a secret list of things that would disqualify someone   from being your significant other? ’ ’   Apparently, many people do  —   and now those lists are not so   secret anymore. ’ ’ on ”relationship deal breakers,”   published last year in the journal Personality and Social   Psychology Bulletin, represents ”the first systematic and   comprehensive attempt to understand the traits that people avoid   in their partners,” the team of social scientists behind the   studies . ’ ’   In one of those studies, the researchers asked a nationally   representative sample of 5, 541 single Americans to reveal which   in a list of 17 things would be a ”deal breaker” when considering   a ”committed relationship” with someone. ’ ’   The top three deal breakers for men and women were ”disheveled or   unclean appearance,” ”lazy,” and ”too needy.” Here’’s the full   list: ’ ’  ’ ’   People reported an average of six deal breakers out of the 17 on   the list. Men were more likely than women to say ”having kids,   living too far away, talks too much, and a low sex drive” were   deal breakers, while women were more likely to say ”lacking     being too lazy, being too needy, and engaging   too often in   video games” were deal breakers. ’ ’   Respondents ranged in age from 21 to 76; older people tended to   have more deal breakers than younger ones, and women tended to   have more deal breakers than men. ’ ’   Differences between the answers from men and women ”were modest,”   the researchers  ”which may be unsurprising given that men and women   are more alike than different.” ’ ”   While the study was large, it relied on  ; people’s   deal breakers may not always be what they say they are, since   some may not be willing to admit their actual deal breakers or   even be aware of them. There are also likely many qualities   people avoid that are not on the researchers’ list of 17. ” ’ This is an updated version of a story that originally   appeared in October 2015. ’
