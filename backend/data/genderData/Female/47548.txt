’  ’ ”   The FBI interviewed Hillary Clinton Saturday morning in   connection with the ongoing investigation into her use of a   private email server as secretary of state, the presumptive   Democratic presidential nominee’s campaign said. ” ’   ”Secretary Clinton gave a voluntary interview this morning about   her email arrangements while she was secretary,” spokesman Nick   Merrill said. ’ ’   He added: ”She is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist   the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a   conclusion. Out of respect for the investigative process, she   will not comment further on her interview.” ’ ’   The interview occurred at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, and   lasted approximately three and a half hours, a Clinton aide   said. ’ ”   The FBI’s interview came more than a year after   Clinton first admitted that she conducted official government   business using a personal email address instead of one   issued by the government. ” ’’ ’   Federal authorities began their investigation in August. ’ ”   The FBI has been looking into whether classified material was   mishandled during Clinton’s tenure at the State Department from   2009 to 2013. Reports indicate classified information   traversed her home server, but Clinton has maintained that such   messages were not classified at the time. ” ”   Clinton, who is weeks away from officially accepting the   Democratic Party’s nomination for president at the party’s July   convention, has maintained that using the private email server   was not illegal. ” ’   An inspector general’’s report  appeared to back up Clinton’’s claim, but said   she ”did not comply” with State Department policies requiring her   to surrender ”all emails dealing with department business before   leaving government service.” ’ ’   Clinton has turned over tens of thousands of her     emails over the course of the investigation. About 30, 000 more   emails that were deemed ”personal” were deleted. ’
