President Barack Obama’s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett spoke Friday at boxing legend Muhammad Ali’s funeral.  Jarrett remembered Ali as having led America from its “original sin of slavery and discrimination” on a “path towards salvation. ” “Brash, defiant, pioneering, joyful, never tired, always game to test the odds. He was our most basic freedoms, religion, speech, spirit. He embodied our ability to invent ourselves. His life spoke to our original sin of slavery and discrimination and the journey he traveled help to shock our consciousness and lead us on a roundabout path towards salvation,” Jarrett stated.
