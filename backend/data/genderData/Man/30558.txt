Rookies are the butt of jokes in nearly every profession, but in the NFL it can come at a cost as Houston Texans rookie K. J. Dillon found out when he ordered a $16 salad but ended up stuck with a $16, 000 dinner bill and bar tab, racked up by his teammates. [After accompanying teammates to a night on the town after the team’s Week 15 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, the   draft pick ruefully tweeted (but later deleted) the results of his evening with a photo of the bill captioned “When you get left with the tab. ”  A screen shot of the receipt taken by CBS Sports shows orders for quite a lot of   meals. Some of the meals included seven orders of sea bass with lobster ($349. 65) two filet mignons ($105. 90) two broiled Atlantic salmon ($83. 90) and a HUGE bill for 22 Hennessy Pardis Imperials at a whopping $7, 700. 00. Oh, and there was also an entry for one Caesar salad at $12. 95. Apparently that was Dillon’s order, as the player later tweeted.
