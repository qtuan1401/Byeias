’  ’ ’   The Baltimore Ravens came up with a brilliant play that allowed   them to successfully run out the final 11 seconds of their game   against the Cincinnati Bengals and to do it all they had to do   was commit a boatload of penalties. ’ ”   With the Ravens leading by seven points, they faced a fourth   down at their own   line with 11 seconds to go. There was   too much time for the punter, Sam Koch, to scramble around and   run out the clock and they certainly didn’t want to punt the ball   to the Bengals and given them a reasonable shot at either a punt   return or a Hail Mary. ” ’   Instead, the Ravens held the entire defense  —   on purpose. ’ ’   After Koch took the snap, it looked like a WWE wrestling Royal   Rumble broke out all over the field. Everywhere you looked a   Ravens player was holding a Bengals defender and flags came   flying from the officials. ’ ’ ’ ’   There were literal bear hugs, pulled jerseys, and take downs all   over the field.  ’ ’  ’ ’   By holding the defenders on purpose, that gave Koch enough time   to wander around the end zone and run out the final 11 seconds.    By the time any defender reached Koch the clock had run out   and he simply stepped out of the back of the end zone for a   safety. ’ ’   Initially, most assumed the Bengals would get another play. But   since the penalties were against the team with the ball, the   result of the play stood and there was no additional untimed   down. It was game over. ’ ’ ’ ’   Not exactly how the rule was intended, but you have to give the   Ravens credit for finding the loophole and using it to their   advantage. ’
