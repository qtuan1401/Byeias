Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( ) tells Democracy Now! viewers that he wants Democrats to come together to ensure abortion business Planned Parenthood is protected from defunding by Republicans. [“We can come together, immigrants  —   man, my daughters they have so many more rights today  —   and I want to make sure they (GOP) keep their dirty, filthy hands off of Planned Parenthood and we don’t have somebody on the Supreme Court that’s going to turn the clock around,” Gutierrez, a Hillary Clinton supporter, told Bernie Sanders supporter, actor Danny Glover.  Abortion has taken center stage for Democrats in their most radical platform yet that calls for protecting abortion business Planned Parenthood from defunding and for the repeal of the Hyde amendment, a longstanding federal provision that prohibits taxpayer funding of abortion. Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton has said unborn babies have no constitutional rights and that she wants to work to repeal the Hyde amendment so that taxpayer funding of abortion is expanded to include   women  —   likely mostly minority women  —   who use Medicaid as their health insurance. The focus on abortion comes after a year of Planned Parenthood having to play defense following a series of undercover videos that exposed the abortion business’s apparent practices of selling the body parts of babies it aborts on the open market and altering the position of babies during abortion in order to harvest the most intact organs. Gutierrez said he hopes that all identity groups  —   illegal immigrants, Black Lives Matter, militant LGBT groups, and women’s rights advocates  —   would come together behind Hillary Clinton. He added that women in Puerto Rico never had the kind of control over their bodies they have now. “We’re going to protect Planned Parenthood, we’re going to protect women’s right to choose,” he said, urging Democrats to unify their party around Clinton.
