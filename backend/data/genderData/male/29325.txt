Wednesday on CNN’s “New Day,” actor and comedian D. L. Hughley criticized former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for  claimed that Black Lives Matter was “inherently racist. ”  Hughley said, “When Rudy Giuliani says that Black Live Matter are terrorists  —   let me tell you something, I don’t think all black people or all white people are all anything. But to be castigated with the same brush that they did Micah Johnson would be the equivalent of me telling you all white people think like Dylan Roof, and that would be deeply offensive. And to allow somebody to say that on air  —  and to go unchallenged and say that on air because a lot of people want that narrative because it edifies their perspective. ” He added, “I think there was nothing loving about that situation. I think he was brutal mayor who basically had a reign of terror of black people in this country  —   in this city. To me, taking advice from Rudy Giuliani is like Kim Kardashian giving me marriage advice. It is ridiculous. It is ridiculous when you have a person who has set up some of the most heinous things that have happened to black people in this country, and to say something like that every time somebody says something about injustice, they are the terrorists. MLK would be considered a terrorist, Gandhi was a terrorist, Mandela was a terrorist. And all they were trying to do was fight for justice. And to me, when old white men tell black men how to act, that’s the most ridiculous thing in the world. To tell black people to speak a certain way and to act a certain way is no different from telling a woman how to dress so she doesn’t get raped. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
