During his talk at University   on     MILO argued that civil rights activist Al Sharpton is motivated by money rather than political values.[  “Al Sharpton is all about the money. His career as a leader for black people can be summed up by the he made in 2005 for Loanmax, a title loan company. Title loans can have outrageous interest, up to 300% annual percentage rate, but Al didn’t care because he could get a check,” he said.  “Now he makes $500, 000 a year to be on MSNBC. He has a net worth estimated at $5 million. Dividing blacks and whites really pays off!” he continued.  He also criticised Sharpton’s role in multiple hoaxes, adding that he has a “history of leading black people by inciting division between the races,” as well as his involvement in “protests against police and whites that have had real effects, like the deaths of innocent and unrelated parties.
