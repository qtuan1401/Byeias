’  ’ ”   Last week saw the  in the number of   active drilling rigs in the U. S. since the start of this year,   suggesting that optimism is returning, albeit cautiously, to the   shale plays, and nowhere did things look better than Texas’   prolific Permian   regarded as America’s ’sleeping   giant’. ” ’   Operators in the Permian added  to their active count during the   week, in the latest demonstration that the basin is perhaps the   most viable across the shale patch, with its low production costs   and abundant reserves. ’ ’   The Permian is enjoying  from the energy industry   and from private equity alike. Those with a presence in the basin   are upbeat about the future, and those without are trying to step   into it in order to share in the riches. ’ ”   One of the biggest operators in the Permian, Pioneer Natural   Resources, just recently indicated its optimism for the short   term. Speaking at an industry conference, Pioneer’s executive VP   Joey Hall  the company is planning to allocate $1. 8     90 percent of its total   operations in the   Permian. What’s more, the company is ready to ramp up its rig   count in its two Permian fields   Spraberry and Wolfcamp   and   has its overall production growth   projections to 12 percent. A bold move in a still oversaturated   oil market that has just seen the   of Iran. ” ’   Another of the majors, Occidental Petroleum, is also  a production increase in the Permian,   of   percent, to be fuelled by capex of some $3 billion. The   company is consistently working on lowering its production costs,   which last year  around $40 a barrel, to ensure its   profitability even if prices start sliding again. ’ ’’ ’        ’ ”   Pioneer, by the way, was also  as a suitable takeover target for   Occidental, reinforcing an impression that Permian operators   should take advantage of the situation and consolidate to   maximize the benefits low production costs and a stable oil price   offer them at the moment. Tying up with a peer could indeed bring   in synergies that will enhance profitability and resilience in   the face of future price slumps. After all, it’s unclear how long   this will last, especially after OPEC’s recent meeting ended with   no change of the organization’s production policy: members can   still pump as much as they can. ” ’   For now, however, both Occidental and Pioneer seem to prefer to   go it alone, as do other players in the Permian, and they all   sound relatively optimistic. A recent  among Permian operators by the local   Midland   found that there is a general consensus   that oil prices will continue to be volatile in the     and that the drive to improve efficiency and reduce costs is the   surest way to stay profitable in the   environment. The   general mood was positive. ’ ’   Whether or not consolidation will rear its head in the Permian   anytime soon, operators there have two things going for them that   are unique for the play: the easier accessibility (hence low   production costs) of the crude and its prodigious volume. Making   the best of these while they last is the only reasonable course   of action at the moment. ’ ’Last week saw the first significant increase in. ..’
