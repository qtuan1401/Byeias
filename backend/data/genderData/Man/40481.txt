 (CNN)”Thank you God for watching over us and keeping us safe.” That’s what Kim Kardashian had to say Saturday afternoon after a car in which she was riding slid off the road in Montana, southwest of Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport.  Sister Khloe Kardashian and ”at least one other occupant” were in the car when it went into a ditch on their side of the road, Capt. Mark Wilfore of the Montana Highway Patrol said. No one was injured and the car did not slide into oncoming traffic, Wilfore said. No report was filed because the incident was not considered a crash and there were no injuries, damage or citations issued.  ”We responded to that   along with a number of other   at the same time,” he said. ”It was a busy morning. We had gotten some snow this morning, last evening and again this morning, so the roads were pretty slick.” When asked to confirm reports that Kardashian’s daughter, North West, and Kylie Jenner also were passengers, Wilfore said he had not received that information from the responding officer.  He could not state who was driving. The incident comes two weeks after Kim and Khloe Kardashian’s stepfather    and Kylie’s father    Bruce Jenner, was involved in a fatal car wreck in California. Kim and Khloe Kardashian were in Montana with half sister Kylie Jenner and family friend Jonathan Cheban to ski and be seen, per numerous social media images of them on the slopes.
