MSNBC’s “Hardball” host Chris Matthews argued that “in fact, there is” “a vast   conspiracy out to get” Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday’s “MSNBC Live. ”  Matthews said, “Hillary, you know, I think somebody saying to your face, talk about bad manners, you’re dishonest. Well, wow, you’re saying to former secretary of state, former senator from New York, you’re dishonest? That’s pretty nervy for a young person to say that to a major figure in American life like that kid did. And Hillary, what’s she going to say, I’m not dishonest? she has to go back to the motives of those who have raised the questions about her honesty, which is, unfortunately for her, very much like what she said back during the Monica days, when she said there’s a vast   conspiracy out to get me. But, in fact, there is. This is the weirdness about politics.  It can be, that you can also have a problem, but your enemies are going to blow it up out of proportion. ” (  Washington Free Beacon) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
