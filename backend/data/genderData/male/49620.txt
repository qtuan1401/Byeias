’  ’ ’   South Dakota State took an early   lead on North Dakota State   on Saturday with one of the more fun trick plays of the college   football season. ’ ’   Lined up at the   line, South Dakota bunched up several   offensive linemen, seemingly preparing to bulldoze their way into   the end zone. ’ ’   Quarterback Taryn Christion took the snap and quickly handed the   ball off to running back Brady Mengarelli, who was crouched   behind the offensive line. Christion and wide receiver Alex Wilde   then ran to the right, distracting the defense. ’ ’   In the meantime, as the defense followed Christion and Wilde,   Mengarelli stood up and ran his way into the end zone. ’ ’ ’ ’Something straight out of ”Little Giants”! This is how South Dakota St. just scored on NDSU. ..😂😂😂   ’
