 (CNN) Here’s some background information about volcanoes, mountains that open downward to a reservoir of molten rock.   Volcano also refers to a vent in the Earth’s crust from which molten rock, ash and gas emanate. Facts:More than 80% of the Earth’s surface, both above and below sea level, was formed by volcanoes. Lava is molten rock from a volcano that has reached the Earth’s surface. Molten rock below the Earth’s surface is referred to as magma. Volcanoes are generally classified into four main types:  Cinder cones   the most common volcanoes, steep conical hills with a vent and a crater at the summit, usually no more than 1, 000 feet high. Examples: Sunset Crater Arizona, Lassen Peak in California, and San Quintin Volcanic Field in Baja, Mexico.   Composite volcanoes or stratovolcanoes   symmetrical,   and have a conduit system through which magma flows to the surface through one or more vents, can reach 8, 000 feet in height. Examples: Mount St. Helens, Mount Fuji, Redoubt, Pinatubo, Soufriere Hills and Mount Pelée in Martinique.   Lava domes   small masses of lava that accumulate around and over the volcano’s vent, then cool to break apart flowing down the dome’s side. They commonly occur inside the crater of large stratovolcanoes or composite volcanoes. Example: Augustine Volcano in Alaska,   Shield volcanoes   form when fluid lava cools to form a gently sloping hill. The largest group of volcanoes on Earth is of this type. Examples: Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, Eyjafjallajokull and Grimsvotn in Iceland, and Novarupta in Alaska. There are more than 500 volcanoes that have erupted at least once in the world, and 50 of those are located in the United States. More than 50% of the world’s active volcanoes above sea level encircle the Pacific Ocean, forming the ”Ring of Fire.” The ring starts at New Zealand, goes north around the eastern coast of Asia to the Aleutian Islands, and south down the western coasts of North, Central and South America. Deadliest Volcanic Eruptions since 1500 A. D. Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI):Proposed in 1982, the Volcanic Explosivity Index measures the relative magnitude of an explosive volcanic eruption. It is similar to the Richter Scale, which measures the magnitude of earthquakes. On a scale of    each whole number represents a tenfold increase of explosivity. Uses several factors to determine a number, including volume of erupted pyroclastic material (for example, ashfall, pyroclastic flows and other ejecta) height of eruption column, duration in hours and qualitative descriptive terms. (USGS) Major and Notable Eruptions, most VEI 4 and above (1902   current):(Sources: CNN, National Geophysical Data Center   World Data Service  Smithsonian’s Global Volcanism Program) May 7, 1902   La Soufrière on St. Vincent island erupts, resulting in 1, 680 deaths. (VEI 4)  May 8, 1902   Mount Pelée on Martinique erupts, destroying the town of St. Pierre, and killing almost 30, 000 people. (VEI 4) August 30, 1902   Mount Pelée on Martinique erupts again, killing more than 1, 000 people. (VEI 4) October 24, 1902   Santa Maria in Guatemala erupts, resulting in more than 1, 500 deaths. (VEI 6) 1907   Ksudach in Russia erupts, one of the Kamchatka region’s largest. (VEI 5) January 30, 1911   Taal volcano in the Philippines erupts, killing 1, 335 people. (VEI 4) 1912   Novarupta volcano erupts in Alaska. It is the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century in the United States, producing 21 cubic kilometers of volcanic material. (VEI 6) January 17, 1913   Colima in Mexico erupts. (VEI 5) 1916   Cerro Azul in Chile erupts. (VEI 5) May 19, 1919   Kelut in East Java, Indonesia, erupts, resulting in 5, 110 deaths. (VEI 4) January 8, 1933   Kharimkotan in Russia erupts. (VEI 5) January 15, 1951   Mount Lamington, Papua New Guinea, erupts and kills 2, 942 people. (VEI 4) October 22, 1955   Bezymianny in Russia erupts. (VEI 5) February 18, 1963   Agung in Indonesia erupts. (VEI 5) May 18, 1980   Mount St. Helens in Washington erupts, killing 57 people and disrupting highways and railways. (VEI 5) March 28, 1982   El Chichon in Mexico erupts, resulting in 1, 879 deaths. (VEI 5) March 27, 1986   Augustine Volcano in Alaska sends up an ash cloud, disrupting air traffic. (VEI 4) April 2, 1991   The eruption of Pinatubo Volcano in the Philippines results in the loss of 350 lives, mostly from collapsed buildings. (VEI 6) August 8, 1991   Cerro Hudson in Chile erupts. (VEI 5) March 20, 2010   The volcano Eyjafjallajokull erupts in Iceland for the first time since an eruption in the early 1820s. (VEI 4) April   2010   A stronger eruption of Eyjafjallajokull expels an ash cloud 30, 000 feet into the air, shutting down airports in northern and western Europe for a week. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that the work disruption due to volcanic ash cost the airline industry $1. 7 billion in revenue. (VEI 4) September 27, 2014   Mount Ontake in Japan erupts suddenly, engulfing hikers in an ash cloud. At least 57 people are killed. (VEI3) May 21, 2016   Mount Sinabung in Indonesia erupts, killing at least seven people.
