This weekend’s “Saturday Night Live” on NBC opened with a mock campaign ad for GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz, played by Taran Killam, where he made fun of all things Ted Cruz.  “I won the Iowa caucus, thanks to endorsements from strong conservatives like Glenn Beck and God Almighty. I’ll admit I’m an unconventional candidate, I’m not like other politicians. I didn’t get where I am today because I was born wealthy or handsome or charismatic or nice. I am not cool or likeable or even fine. I’m not young and hip. I am not off the chain. I’m not energetic and healthy. Physically, I’m not doing well at all. From the side I look like a Far Side cartoon,” he stated. In the faux ad, Killam as Cruz even noted the false reports spread by the Cruz campaign about fellow GOP candidate Dr. Ben Carson.
