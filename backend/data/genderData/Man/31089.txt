MSNBC’s “Hardball” host Chris Matthews declared that the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “doesn’t have a soul” and has “no focus” on Friday’s “MSNBC Live. ”  Matthews said, “I believe that Bill Clinton believes that this campaign of Hillary Clinton’s  …    it’s terrible, it’s badly run, it hasn’t even been thought through. There is no focus to it. When you ask her why you’re running, you don’t get a good answer, and there’s no joy. There’s no Clinton fun. It’s totally missing a soul. And if you have a campaign without a soul, you’ve got a real problem, no matter where you’re running. Anyway, that’s my latest theory, it doesn’t have a soul. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
