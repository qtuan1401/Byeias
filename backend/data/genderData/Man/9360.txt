Texas radio station HITS 105 has vowed never to play Madonna’s music again following her   speech Saturday at the Women’s March on Washington, in which she said she had often thought about “blowing up the White House. ”[‘Texarkana’s Classic Hits station  —   HITS 105 is taking all Madonna songs off the air in the station’s local programming indefinitely following the singer’s comments over the weekend,” the radio station said in a statement posted to its Facebook page.  HITS 105 general manager Terry Thomas said “banning all Madonna songs at HITS 105 is not a matter of politics, it’s a matter of patriotism. ” Madonna headlined the   demonstration in Washington D. C. over the weekend and delivered an incendiary speech from the stage. “Yes, I’m angry. Yes, I’m outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know that this won’t change anything,” Madonna said. Thomas says it’s inappropriate to play the Material Girl’s music after hearing her “  sentiments. ” “It just feels wrong to us to be playing Madonna songs and paying her royalties when the artist has shown   sentiments,” Thomas said. “If all stations playing Madonna took their lead from us, that would send a powerful economic message to Madonna. ” Madonna defended her comments, saying they were taken “wildly out of context. ” Nevertheless, the U. S. Secret Service has reportedly opened an investigation into the  ’s comments.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
