’  ’ ”   Phil Mickelson’s golf ball has left the building. ” ”   Mickelson’s second round at the PGA Championship got off to a   horrible start when his opening drive on the first hole went out   of bounds and then bounded down a side street, never to be seen   again. ” ’   If you look closely, you can see the ball bouncing down the side   street that leads away from the course. ’ ’ ’ ’   Amazingly, things only got worse from there. Mickelson took a   second drive, and this one went way to the right, just missing a   creek and ending up next to a cart path. ’ ’ ’ ’   At this point, Mickelson is playing his fourth shot on the par   four, and things are not looking up. ’ ’  ’ ’   That shot overflew the hole and ended up close to the backyard   fence of a neighboring house. ’ ’   Ouch. ’ ’  ’ ’   That chip landed short of the green. He would eventually get      from that spot for a   7. ’ ’   Mickelson is now 4 over with the projected cut line at 1 over. ’ ”   It doesn’t look good for Mickelson, and his face says it all. ” ’ ’
