Warner Bros. released the first teaser trailer for Christopher Nolan’s   World War II drama Dunkirk on Thursday, after a pirated, incomplete copy leaked online earlier in the day. [While plot details are scarce, the film reportedly focuses on the 1940 evacuation of British soldiers from the seaport of Dunkirk in Northern France in 1940, which saw more than 300, 000 British and Allied soldiers move out as the German army invaded and strengthened its grip on France.  The trailer is short and sparse and features none of the principal cast members, save for Cillian Murphy in a brief shot at the end, huddled along with other Allied soldiers as an air raid siren sounds overhead. The films stars Murphy, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, James D’Arcy and One Direction alum Harry Styles. Christopher Nolan (Interstellar, Dark Knight trilogy) wrote and directed the project. Dunkirk is in theaters July 21, 2017.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum,
