PARIS (AP)  —   France’s foreign minister is denouncing possible Russian meddling in the French presidential campaign as “unacceptable. ”[  Ayrault, in an interview published Sunday in newspaper Journal du Dimanche, said Russia appears to be targeting centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, while favoring more   candidates such as conservative Francois Fillon and nationalist Marine Le Pen.  Macron’s campaign has described hacking attempts that it suspects are linked to Russia, though it’s unclear whether the detected activity was more than routine cybersecurity breaches. The Kremlin has denied involvement. Ayrault is quoted as saying “this kind of interference in French democratic life is unacceptable  …    . The French will not accept anyone dictating their (electoral) choices. ” The French government is holding an election security meeting Friday to discuss concerns raised by alleged Russian interference in the U. S. presidential campaign.
