They all want good games, and there’s not enough good   teams.” ’ ’   He continued, saying the   games in particular were   a problem: ’ ’’ ’   Madden pointed to the Washington Redskins, who played Sunday   night against the Green Bay Packers and then had to travel to   Dallas to play the   game against the Cowboys.   Madden called that a scheduling ”oops,” saying older players   needed more time to recover. ’ ’   This year, the NFL blamed its poor TV ratings on the presidential   election, saying debates and other election coverage were   distracting viewers.
