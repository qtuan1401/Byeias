House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) will allow a vote on legislation dealing with terrorism and guns next week. [The details of the legislation have not been made available, but Roll Call reports that Ryan told House Republicans about the vote during a June 30 conference call.  During the call, Ryan said it is “common sense that suspects on terror watch lists not be able to buy guns. ” His announcement of this scheduled vote comes one week after House Democrats ended their     for gun control. Breitbart News previously reported that a number of Senate Republicans are ready to support gun control as well. Senator Chuck Schumer ( ) observed that mixing the language of gun control with the language of fighting terrorism has yielded GOP support from Senators like Lindsey Graham ( ) Kelly Ayotte ( ) Pat Toomey ( ) and Susan Collins ( ) among others. For his part, Ryan continues to stress that House gun control has to contain “a provision [protecting] due process for people who may mistakenly be added to [no fly or terror watch] lists. ”  But it is important to note that Omar Mateen was not on such a list, so gun control based on such lists would have been impotent to stop him. It is equally important to note that San Bernardino attackers Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik were not on a such a list either. This makes it difficult to ascertain how more   gun control is going to stop such attackers.
