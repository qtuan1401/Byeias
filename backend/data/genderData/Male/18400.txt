Prospective candidate for U. S. Senate from Louisiana, retired Colonel Rob Maness, is calling on Congress to ensure that lawmakers “use every resource at their disposal, including the power of the purse, to rein in his lawlessness once and for all. ”[Maness says he’s strongly opposed to Barack Obama’s “illegal executive order to restrict our 2nd Amendment rights. ”  Maness released the following statement, calling Republicans in Congress who are unwilling to fight the measure “spineless. ” While President Obama has long proven himself to be an avowed enemy of the 2nd Amendment, today he took it to a whole new level with this   through executive fiat. Unfortunately, President Obama’s arrogance has been emboldened by a spineless Republican Congress that has done little to rein in his illegal executive authority over the past seven years. After Republicans did nothing to stop the President’s last illegal   which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants via executive fiat, should we really be surprised that he is now trying to use the same tactic to force his treacherous   agenda down our throats? It is my belief that if we are ever going to stop President Obama and his radical agenda, we need to do something about these jellyfish Republicans who constantly allow him to run roughshod over our rights. And that is why I am calling on every member of Congress, especially my fellow Republicans, to grow a spine and join me in the fight to not only defend our 2nd amendment rights, but also defend the entire system of checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution from our imperial President.
