A woman in Indiana has been accused of injecting human feces into the IV bag of her   son in a likely effort to hasten his death, authorities say. [Prosecutors have charged Wolcott, Indiana, resident Tiffany Alberts, 41, with seven felony charges, including aggravated battery and one count of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury, according to WLFI Channel 18.  Marion County officials say Alberts knowingly injected the feces mixture into her    son’s IV bag as he underwent treatment for cancer. The woman’s actions were eventually discovered when doctors encountered infections popping up in the stricken child that couldn’t be explained. Hospital staffers placed video surveillance on the child’s hospital room to figure out the source of the constant infections. Eventually, the surveillance video showed the child’s mother injecting something into the boy’s IV bags. Upon further investigation, doctors identified organisms that usually only appear in feces. There was no legitimate explanation for the organisms to be present in the boy’s blood unless it was an act of sabotage. Under questioning, Alberts initially insisted she only injected water into the bags to “clean the lines” but later allegedly admitted to injecting feces into the bags. Doctors also feared the woman injected diarrheal medication and weight loss pills into the boy causing further harm and preventing his body from fighting the cancer. The child responded well to medical treatment after his mother was taken into custody, but doctors fear the delay in proper treatment caused the boy to miss the optimal window to help him beat his Leukemia into remission.
