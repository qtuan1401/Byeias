Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) criticized Democratic National Committee chairwomen Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) and said she is not the kind of chair that the Democratic Party needs.  Sanders said, “Do I think she’s the kind of chair that Democratic Party needs, No I don’t. What we need right now is revitalize democracy in America, to bring millions of young people and working class people into the system, to a significant degree. Frankly what the Democratic Party is about people running around to rich people’s homes and raising obscene sums of money from wealthy people. What we need to do is to say to working class people, ‘we’re on your side.’ We know that you need the ability to send your kids to college and you can’t afford it right now. We know that many cases the income that you’re making has gone down. We are prepared to stand up to Wall Street, whose greed has done so much harm to our economy, to corporate America who sending jobs 20 China in five minutes if they can make $2 more in profits. That’s the kind of party we need to be vital party, working class people who are young people who have a dream that this country can be much more than it is today. Not just party where we have our folks raising money for wealthy people. ”
