 (CNN) British hostage John Cantlie appears in a new ISIS video that was distributed online Tuesday. In the video, dated July 12, Cantlie refers to the bombed site of the University of Mosul    some of which was targeted by coalition planes in March    behind him.  Cantlie also shows a neighborhood destroyed by what he calls coalition bombing, and in another segment shows people shopping for the Eid festival, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. That section appears to have been filmed several days ago Eid ended on Sunday.  In March, reports surfaced that the university, which was considered a base for ISIS fighters, was hit. CNN confirmed the strikes with two sources: someone inside the university and with Athil Al Nujayfi, the former governor of Nineveh province, where Mosul is located. The UK Foreign Office said itâ€™s aware of the video and is analyzing its content.  Cantlie was kidnapped in November 2012.  He has been featured in a series of ISIS propaganda videos with the last one being posted in March. It was also recorded in Mosul. CNN cannot confirm whether the new video is authentic or when and where it was shot. In it, Cantlie wears an oversized gray   shirt and black pants. In his first video, in 2014, Cantlie made it clear that he was forced to share a message from ISIS.
