’  ’ ’   A group of elite American special operations troops on Sunday   carried out a ground raid deep inside Syria to capture ISIS   operatives. ’ ”   US troops inserted by helicopter spent roughly 90 minutes on the   ground near Deir    —   about 80 miles from ISIS’s     capital in Raqqa  —   before witnesses say they left carrying   captured ISIS fighters and bodies,  which first   reported the story. ” ’   The Pentagon confirmed that a raid had taken place, but declined   to offer details. ’ ’   Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the coalition, told The Post,   ”The coalition can confirm a US operation in the vicinity of Deir     Jan. 8.” ’ ’   ”The US and the entire   coalition will continue to   pursue ISIL leaders wherever they are to ensure the security and   stability of the region and our homelands,” he added, using   another name for the terrorist group. ’ ’’ ’   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights  were killed during the raid, though   that number has not been confirmed. ’ ”   This isn’t the first time US forces have conducted these types of   ground raids. Though much of the focus of coalition forces has   centered on retaking the Iraqi city of Mosul, the US has sent   troops in to capture leaders or rescue hostages on several   occasions. ” ”   One  in Iraq’s Kirkuk   province freed dozens of hostages and resulted in the death of   Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler, a    Delta Force operator   who was the first American service member killed in a firefight   with ISIS militants. ” ’   The US military has more than  on the ground in Iraq currently,   a number that has steadily crept up since roughly 300 troops were    the Baghdad   airport. ’
