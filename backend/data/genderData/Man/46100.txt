”As Business Insider’s transportation reporter, flying on planes is an integral part of my job description.” ”Unfortunately for me, acrophobia is also a major part of life.

I don’t like the instability, the single engine, and I don’t like the   frequent instances of general aviation aircraft falling out of the sky.”
