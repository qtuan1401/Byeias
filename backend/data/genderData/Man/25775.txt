A senior store detective at Macy’s has been fired from his job after he intervened when a female customer reported that a man entered the women’s bathroom. After he was asked to leave the restroom, the man complained saying he believes he is really a female. The woman and her daughter were frightened by the man’s presence. [The case is now before the New York State Division of Human Rights, reports the ChurchMilitant. com.  Javier Chavez says he was never told about any policy that would allow men to use women’s facilities. He also told store managers that any policy that would allow men in a woman’s restroom violates his Catholic faith but he would abide with store mandates. The comment about his faith is what got him in trouble, Chavez says. He was suspended from his job and then later fired. The store detective said that a security officer was told to tell the man to leave because the woman and her daughter were afraid to use the restroom when he was in there. Chavez was then informed that men identifying as a woman could use the women’s bathroom. He said he was not aware of this rule prior to when the man was asked to leave. Chavez is now suing the store because he was terminated because of his religion, reported the ChurchMilitant. com. “After my employer learned that I was a practicing Catholic, with religious concerns about this policy,” the lawsuit complaint states, “I was terminated because of my religion, in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law. ” The New York civil rights legislation prohibits discrimination based on “age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, marital status or disability,” it reported.
