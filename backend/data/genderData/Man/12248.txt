Tuesday during a Fox Sports 1 “Speak for Yourself” debate about whether or not the Seattle Seahawks would be a good fit for free agent Colin Kaepernick,   Colin Cowherd joked that Kaepernick is running out of liberal cities that would welcome the controversial quarterback who protested police shootings during the national anthem in 2016.  “[H]e’s running out of liberal cities  —   San Francisco, Seattle,” Cowherd said. “Unless Vermont joins the league, he’s running out of liberal cities. ” He later added, “I don’t think he’s a franchise quarterback. Seattle’s probably the best fit. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
