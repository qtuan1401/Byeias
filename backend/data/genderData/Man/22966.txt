On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” filmmaker Michael Moore  reacted to the FBI announcing it was taking a second look into Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails by stating, “She has been attacked and abused for 30 years. I’m sick of it. I don’t want to hear this 11 days before the election.   …     Bill, this is just such bullsh*t. ”  Moore said, “This is just another one of these things. She has been attacked and abused for 30 years. I’m sick of it. I don’t want to hear this 11 days before the election. ” He added, “[i]f these emails  —   these new emails can prove that she started a war because a dictator threatened to kill her daddy, or she   on behalf of Halliburton, or maybe she yelled at an aide to get her more  . Maybe then, I want to read the emails. But other than that, Bill, this is just such bullsh*t. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
