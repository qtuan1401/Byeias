Harry Potter fans, take heart: If you are looking for tickets to the London stage play inspired by J. K. Rowling’s books, there are plenty more coming your way. The show’s producers said this week that 250, 000 tickets to “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” would be released next Thursday. Performances of the play are sold out through May (though a small number of tickets are available through a lottery each week, and   tickets occasionally go on sale). The new tickets being released are for performances taking place from next spring through   2017. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” takes place 19 years after the end of the final book and tracks the    of Harry’s son Albus. The production had its first previews in June, and it officially opened, to enthusiastic reviews, this week. It has two parts, which viewers can watch in a day or over the course of two days. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote that the play conjures “a kind of magic that is purely theatrical yet somehow channels the addictive narrative grip of Ms. Rowling’s prose. ”
