’  ’ ’   Part of the appeal of HBO’’s ”Silicon Valley” is that it really   tries to get  of the tech industry right, which may be   why so many programmers and tech companies have embraced the   show. ’ ”   But one zinger in last night’s season finale might have cut too   close for Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes. ” ’   In the episode, main character and Pied Piper CEO Richard   Hendricks is facing questions about his company and its user   base, which, as it turns out, is partially fake. ’ ’   ”This is fraud,” Jared Dunn, head of business development at Pied   Piper, tells Hendricks. ’ ’   Hendricks had a perfect response: ”Is it? Our platform does   exactly what it says it does. It’’s not like we’’re          lying, like Theranos.” ’ ’   ”And if our platform works, which we know it will, we will make   them billions of dollars. Everyone wins,” Hendricks said. ’ ”   The timely joke is referring to the   company’s   recent woes. In May, the company voided  from its proprietary Edison     machines. ” ”   That was only the latest development  that have raised doubts that Holmes’   company has any valuable, proprietary working technology at all. ” ”   To many, Holmes  about her company’s capabilities. ” ”   That’s why the fictional Hendricks draws the sharp comparison   between his company and Theranos. To him, his technology is real   and it works   Pied Piper is only lying about its user numbers. ” ”   That’s not the only hilarious Silicon Valley inside joke in the   episode. In one particularly inspired sequence, Erlich Bachman,   Pied Piper’s head of PR, describes how he played   Sand   Hill Road venture capitalists off each other and received a fat   new round of funding. ” ’   The ”Silicon Valley” season finale can be streamed on  and . ’ ’ ’
