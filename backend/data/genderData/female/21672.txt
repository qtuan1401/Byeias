Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” while commenting on the controversial meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a Arizona airport last week, Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) said when it comes to the FBI investigation into presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified material on a private unsecured email server he has “confidence” Lynch will make a “completely apolitical decision. ”  Schiff said, “I think both of them wish their airplanes had never come near each other. And I think they both acknowledged they preferred they had nerve gotten together. I do think it was a chance encounter, and I do fully believe what the attorney general said, that they discussed nothing about the case, and just talked about their grandkids and playing golf. So I understand this was a regrettable instance where they got together coincidentally, and at the same time the attorney general said she’s going to let the prosecutors make the case. I have every confidence that’s exactly what will happen. ” He added, “You’re never going to satisfy some people, but I have tremendous confidence in the attorney general and Director Comey. They’re straight shooters. They’ve been career prosecutors their entire lives, and if they say they’re going to conduct the investigation by the book, that’s exactly what’s going to happen. I have every confidence that they will make a completely apolitical decision and do what’s in the public interest. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
