An illegal migrant was sentenced to 11 years in prison this week for possessing more than eight pounds of methamphetamine, where he will join his brother, a fellow   who is also serving an   sentence. [In October of 2014,    Mexican national Eleazar   was pulled over on Interstate 75 in Dayton and was found with the large amount of meth by a   unit. Authorities surmised that   was smuggling the drugs into Ohio from Mexico.  This month the suspect was convicted on one count of aggravated possession of drugs and was sentenced to 11 years in a state penitentiary. “The defendants have been deported back to Mexico a number of times previously by the federal government,” Montgomery County Prosecutor Mat Heck said in a press release. “We cannot and will not tolerate anyone bringing massive amounts of drugs into our community. Drugs not only destroy lives but cause additional crime in our neighborhoods. ” When   was arrested in 2014 he was accompanied by his brother, Joel   29. The younger brother was also sentenced to an   stint in prison for possession of the illegal drug. After an investigation by the Miami Valley Bulk Smuggling Task Force, both men were linked to an international drug cartel. The street value of the eight pounds of meth was reported as $450, 000, authorities said. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com
