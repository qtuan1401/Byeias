“We will be looking for those individuals who seek to avoid registering,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters following a Jan. 4 meeting with President Obama regarding executive gun control. [Lynch was referencing the portion of Obama’s pending     measure that will require   to register as federally licensed gun dealers if they meet criteria demonstrating they are “engaged in the business of dealing in firearms. ”  This language also means that private sellers registered as federally licensed dealers will have to perform a background check on every sale. One problem is that the White House executive action fact sheet does not present any numerical minimum on the number of sales that a private seller must conduct before he is considered to be “engaged in the business of dealing in firearms. ” Rather, it indicates a private seller can be considered to be “engaged in the business of selling firearms” regardless of the location from which she sells, the frequency with which he sells, or the number of guns ahe sells. In light of this, CBS News reports that Attorney General Loretta Lynch is making it known that the ATF will be watching and looking for private sellers who “seek to avoid registering” as being “engaged in the business of selling firearms. ” Lynch stressed that an “exception” remains for “the hobbyist and collector,” but the executive order means private sellers cannot continue to “hide behind that [exception]. ” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
