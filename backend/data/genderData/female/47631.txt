’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama on Thursday delivered an emotional   statement on the recent police shootings of two black men. ’ ’   Speaking from Warsaw, Poland, where he is attending a NATO   summit, Obama addressed the shooting deaths of  in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and  in Falcon Heights, Minnesota ’ ’   ”We have seen too many tragedies like this,” he said. ’ ’   ”These are not isolated incidents,” Obama added, before citing   several disturbing statistics that paint a picture of police   practices in the US: ’ ’   ”Because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated   the same, and that hurts,” Obama said. ”This is not just a black   issue or a Hispanic issue  —   this is an American issue.” ’ ’  ’ ’   The president also had words of support for police officers. ’ ’   ”We know you have a tough job, we mourn those in uniform that are   protecting us, who lose their lives,” he said. ’ ”   Obama’s words followed a statement  on Facebook in which he said: ” ’  ’ ’   Demonstrations  in cities nationwide following the latest     shootings. Protesters have criticized the   killings,  during encounters with police. ’ ’   The recent shootings follow a long list of fatal encounters   involving civilians and the police. More than 500 people have   been killed in   shootings in 2016, as noted in an   extensive report . ’ ’   As a result,   leaders, politicians, and community   activists have called for greater oversight of police agencies   nationwide  —   citing the need for body cameras for officers and   pushing for independent reviews and prosecutions of officers   involved in police killings. ’ ’   Obama ended his speech on this note: ”We can do better. And I   believe we will do better.” ’
