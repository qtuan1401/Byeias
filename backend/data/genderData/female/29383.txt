Columnist Pat Buchanan stated, “the Third World is invading the First World, part it coming through Mexico, up through Mexico into the United States” and “If you had 12 million who have walked into your country illegally and stay, or overstay their visas, you’ve got an invasion” on Friday’s “McLaughlin Group. ”  Buchanan said, “I think Tom’s term, existential crisis, is exactly right. What is happening is, the Third World is invading the First World, part it coming through Mexico, up through Mexico into the United States.
