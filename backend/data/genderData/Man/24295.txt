Cook said, “He tried to grab my wallet and I turned like I was going to get my wallet, but I was just stalling and he hit me really hard in the back of the head with the gun. Swung it like a baseball bat. ” That is when Cook’s wife pulled a gun and shot the suspect. CBS News reports that Cook was yelling, “Shoot him, Shoot him,” when the wife fired. The suspect fled and was apprehended after going to a hospital to seek treatment for his gunshot wound.

And I don’t feel bad about that. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
