’  ’ ’   Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green on Wednesday weighed   in on the ongoing feud between New York Knicks owner James Dolan   and former Knicks great Charles Oakley, calling Dolan’’s behavior   akin to a ”slave master mentality.” ’ ’.  ’ ’   ”It was all fine and dandy when he was laying people out, taking   fines and all this stuff for your organization. But now, all of a   sudden, when he says something that he feels, it’’s a problem,” he   added. ’ ’   Oakley was arrested after being ejected from Madison Square   Garden at a Knicks game last week. He was later banned   indefinitely from the arena by Dolan, who also suggested Oakley   had issues with both anger and alcohol. ’ ”   Earlier this week, Dolan lifted Oakley’s ban after the NBA   stepped in and hosted a detente with Dolan, Oakley, NBA   Commissioner Adam Silver, and Michael Jordan.  ” ’’ ”   Still, Oakley has maintained he won’t go to a game until Dolan   gives a public apology.  ” ”   Green is far from the only person in the NBA world to take   Oakley’s side. In fact, there has been practically universal   support for Oakley as a result of his feud with the Knicks   owner.  ” ’     ”That’’s not something that you say to the world. That’’s not     classy at all,” Green added. ”It’’s not OK for you to go     say to the world as a   dollar organization. How     can you even pin that on someone? Just throw that out there.     That’’s grimy. I think that’’s wrong.”   ’ ’Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green on. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
