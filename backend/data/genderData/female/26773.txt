A family returning home from the Outer Banks captured a video of winds from Tropical Storm Hermine knocking over a delivery truck Saturday.[  Ashlyn Gonzalez and her family were crossing the Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge in North Carolina when they noticed the Harris Teeter semi in front of them tipping back and forth. “I got that on video,” one child can be heard saying. “No, the back tires totally lift up. ” “You’ve got to see the front,” a woman said. “You see the front, it’s going straight, so the whole thing  …    ” As the trailer’s back wheels lifted and the rest of the truck came off the ground, the entire family started screaming as the truck landed on its side. “Oh my God. Oh my God! I’m so scared,” one child screamed. Gonzalez told WTVR that she witnessed the accident on the way back from the Outer Banks to Florida. The driver of the truck was not seriously injured, according to WTVR. Another Harris Teeter truck driver was not so lucky. Just a few hours earlier, winds from Tropical Storm Hermine knocked over a truck crossing the Alligator River Bridge, killing the driver, WRIC reports. Both bridges are closed as a result of the accidents.
