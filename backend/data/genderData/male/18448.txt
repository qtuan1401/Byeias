Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attempted to ironically suppress a satirical German music video released two weeks ago, after it mocked Erdogan for being an authoritarian,   media censor. [The music video was made for Extra 3, a German political satire show, and it consisted of a compilation of embarrassing videos featuring Erdogan with the song over the top. The song criticises Erdogan for arresting and supressing opposing journalists, attacking the Kurds, and shutting down an International Women’s Day demonstration. The song also mocks German Chancellor Angela Merkel for cozying up to the leader.  Erdogan’s reaction to the video was reportedly not in good sport, and the authoritarian leader allegedly summoned a German ambassador over the incident. “The ambassador made clear the position of the German government that the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the protection of basic rights, which include freedom of the press and freedom of expression, are values that must be protected,” said a German Foreign Ministry spokesperson. Extra 3 has continued to mock the situation, with one tweet made by the program showing Erdogan attempting to extinguish the internet with a fire extinguisher.

We do it because these are things that we believe need to be addressed,” said the editor of Extra 3 Andreas Lange. “Our motto is, if we shoot and someone yells ‘ouch!’ then we have hit the mark. ” Charlie Nash is a frequent contributor to Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.
