Around 100   militants and 100   took to the streets of Dover in the South East of England today, ostensibly to wage war on the streets over their differing views on the Calais Jungle camp and the ongoing migrant crisis. [But the two groups had very little to say on the issues themselves, with the   militants intent on provoking violence at a march led by the National Front, initially billed to be in support of British truckers being attacked and threatened in Calais, France, by migrants.  The Labour Party’s Diane Abbott, the Shadow Secretary for International Development, attended for 10 minutes early on in the day, to egg on the   militants. The National   protest is charged with using the case of British truckers as a “front” issue by which to assert their nationalism. Both sides of protesters came armed, with many even pulling the cobbles and bricks from the streets to hurl at their opponents as police attempted to control the two groups. While   activists screamed at police for “supporting fascists” the Neo Nazi groups gave Nazi salutes, even accusing a Breitbart London journalist of being a “Marxist” who they hoped “was raped by Muslims”. Kent Police reported nine arrests in total, and said that one person suffered a broken arm, and five others sustained minor injuries during the day’s events.
