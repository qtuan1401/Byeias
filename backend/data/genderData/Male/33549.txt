 (CNN) The North Carolina Tar Heels punched their ticket to the Final Four in Phoenix on Sunday, knocking off the Kentucky Wildcats   in the NCAA South Regional Final.  UNCâ€™s Luke Maye sealed the deal with a long jumper that swished through the net with only a third of a second remaining.  The Tar Heels will play Oregon, the No. 3 seed in the Midwest, on Saturday for a shot to play in the championship game on April 3.  On the other side of the bracket, the Gonzaga Bulldogs will play the underdog South Carolina Gamecocks, the lowest seed    No. 7 in the East    to survive this far.  The Bulldogs and Tar Heels are both No. 1 seeds.
