Days after Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos began the new leg of his Dangerous Faggot tour, a scheduled event at the University of Miami has been cancelled by faculty. [University of Miami’s College Republicans group received notification that the Dangerous Faggot event set to take place on October 3rd at Bank United Field House was to be cancelled due to “security concerns. ” What these security concerns were exactly was not detailed.   Breitbart Tech reached out to the University of Miami for further comment on the matter but received no reply. It is however that these “security concerns” have arisen mere days after Milo put liberal college professors on notice. This wouldn’t be the first time that college faculty have objected to Milo appearing at their events, at Milo’s first date of this tour at Texas Tech multiple college professors signed a petition to ban him from the campus.  During Milo’s previous college events, such as his apperance at DePaul university, professors have ordered security (that Breitbart in part paid for) to stand down as protestors hijacked the event and screamed at Milo. The ensuing fiasco in fact led to the resignation of the DePaul University president. Lucas Nolan is a conservative who regularly contributes articles on censorship and free speech to Breitbart.
