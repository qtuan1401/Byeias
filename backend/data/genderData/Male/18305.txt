Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” in referencing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s medical incident causing her to nearly collapse when leaving the   memorial service in New York City early, Democratic National Committee interim chair Donna Brazile said, “Although she had to be lifted into that van, you know what? She got up, like most of us, she got up and she kept fighting, so that’s the Hillary Clinton that I hope people get to know. ”  Brazile said, “I’ve known her for 33 years. I heard her last night. Every time I hear Hillary Clinton I’m always inspired by her. She’s someone who will lead us. I’m inspired by her fortitude and resilience no matter how tired she was, and she was hurting, and she went out there last Sunday, Joy, because she loves her constituents and wants to stand up for them. And although she had to be lifted into that van, you know what? She got up, like most of us, she got up and she kept fighting, so that’s the Hillary Clinton that I hope people get to know. ” (  WFB) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
