A Pennsylvania woman is accused of stabbing her husband with scissors and biting him because he drank her last beer while she was asleep. [Police charged Tracey Lee Giffin, 45, with aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment, and harassment for stabbing and biting her    husband, Trib Live reports.  The incident arose when Giffin woke up after a nap to find that her husband had drunk her last beer. Her husband said that the two had been drinking during the day before she took a nap. When she woke up, the couple argued until Giffin took out a pair of scissors and started slashing and biting her husband, Penn Live reports. Police say that the victim had cuts on his chest, stomach, and neck. Police also found bite marks on the victim’s arms and thumb. This is not Giffin’s first   with the law over a food item. KDKA reports that on Christmas Eve 2013, she and another man, who was her boyfriend then, got into a fight because Giffin forgot to buy barbecue sauce on the way home. She bit the man on the nose and hand, and she suffered an eye injury. Giffin is currently in Fayette County Jail awaiting a preliminary hearing, according to Trib Live.
