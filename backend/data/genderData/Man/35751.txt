Washington (CNN) It’s been a while since Bernie Sanders has attended the weekly Senate Democratic lunch in the Capitol.  So long, in fact, he forgot where to go Tuesday and headed    with his large Secret Service detail in tow    into the Republican lunch instead.  He quickly realized his mistake and turned around. When a reporter noted, ”wrong room,” Sanders replied, ”Thank you” as he made his way to the Democratic gathering.  Sanders, the Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate, has been largely absent from Capitol Hill while campaigning against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.
