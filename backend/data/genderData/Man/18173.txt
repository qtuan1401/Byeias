A black activist that called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops one year ago just before the execution of a deputy in Harris County, Texas, is now thanking the man who took part in the ambush killings of five police officers in Dallas. [Breitbart Texas reported in late August 2015 that members of #BlackLivesMatter, #FY911 and #FukYoFlag movements were engaging in inciting communication. As reported, they encouraged others on a radio show to “turn the tide” and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America.  One of the F***YoFlag organizers was “Sunshine, ” who hosted a radio blog show from Texas called, “Sunshine’s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. ” A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page appeared in the Breitbart Texas article and shows that she was urging supporters to “Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illustion of white  …    ” [SIC] Harris County Deputy Darren Goforth was executed while at a gas station in northwest Harris County, just 30 miles up the road from where Breitbart Texas first met “Sunshine,” and just two weeks after New Black Panther Party members and Sunshine were calling for the killing of police officers. She has now thanked the man who played a part in executing the Dallas officers. On the morning after the Dallas executions, Breitbart Texas contributor Producer Kenny (@ProducerKen) tweeted the Breitbart Texas article about Sunshine written the year before. Sunshine saw his tweet and responded by saying, “thank you Micah! !” She attached a photograph of television coverage of the horrific executions. @ProducerKen @BreitbartNews thank you Micah!! pic. twitter.   —   I Will Not Comply!
