Washington (CNN) The bear is loose    this time on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. President Barack Obama focused on the economic gains that he hopes will become his presidential legacy during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, and he decided to have a little fun, too    just another sign of a   presidency. ”I have no more campaigns to run,” Obama said, drawing loud applause from Republicans in the chamber. But Obama had a quick comeback: ”I know, ’cause I won both of ’em,” he said going off script and drawing applause from Democrats. The President also strayed from his script earlier on as he touted gains in the economy. ”This is good news, people,” Obama said, followed by a rare presidential wink. Obama also made the first presidential appeal for an Instagram during his speech, appealing to astronaut Scott Kelly to Instagram his upcoming yearlong stay aboard the International Space Station. That remark, though, was included in the President’s prepared speech. RELATED: Obama: ’Tonight, we turn the page’
