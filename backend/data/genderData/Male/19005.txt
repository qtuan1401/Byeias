Bill and Hillary Clinton made $238 million after departing the White House in January 2001, according to Hillary’s newly released tax returns. [Despite being supposedly “dead broke” at the conclusion of their two terms, which happened to coincide with the   bust and an economic downturn, the Clintons made a tremendous amount of money from books and speaking fees.  In recent years, the Clintons were averaging in the twenties. They made $27 million in 2013 and $28 million in 2014. But their haul went down in 2015 to $10. 7 million, perhaps to fashion for themselves a more populist image. Clinton’s tax returns will no doubt impede the candidate’s ability to present herself as a champion of the working class.
