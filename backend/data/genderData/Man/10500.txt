Lightning struck twice at Baylor University’s renowned football program when on Monday the second person this year affiliated with the team was fired in a sex scandal. [The private Baptist university in Waco, Texas, fired their director of football operations, DeMarko Butler, for allegedly sending inappropriate text messages to a teenager.  According to a school official, the texts went to an individual classified as an adult under the laws of the state. Butler had only worked for the university for about a month, KWTX reported. David Kaye, Baylor’s director of athletics communications, stated in an official release from the university, ”DeMarkco Butler is no longer employed by Baylor University. As a personnel matter, we have no further comment. ” In February the university’s head football coach, Matt Rhule, was forced to terminate Brandon Washington, a recently hired strength and conditioning coach after his arrest in a solicitation of prostitution sting.  At that time Rhule said, ”When we arrived at Baylor, we made a commitment to character and integrity in our program. ” He added, ”Brandon’s actions are completely unacceptable. We will not tolerate conduct that is contradictory to these values. ”
