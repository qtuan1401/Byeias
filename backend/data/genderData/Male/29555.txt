Wednesday on the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer weighed in on the Democratic side of the president primary race.  Despite Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) showing strength against Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, Krauthammer was skeptical of Sanders chances beyond that and predicted it would be FBI director James Comey who has the final say in Clinton’s chances beyond the early primaries. “Sanders is not the threat,” Krauthammer said. “Once they go South, I think he has zero chance. It will make it interesting. They will have a lot of storylines about New Hampshire, Iowa  —   but I can’t see a path. What can happen  —   the person who will decide the nomination on the Democratic side is the FBI director, Comey. If he decides to do a criminal referral, I think she can collapse. Either it’s squashed and there’s a huge scandal or there is an indictment, in which case Biden steps forward and offers himself   to the party. ” “If it happens then it is squashed so it doesn’t actually go forward, I can imagine the career lawyers in the FBI are going to resign,” he said. “It will be like the ‘Saturday Night Massacre. ’” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
