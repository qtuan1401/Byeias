On February 9 President Obama released his 2017 budget proposal and it contains “billions for gun control. ”[Much of this is to fund the various aspects of Obama’s January 5 executive gun controls, which include new FBI personnel to handle National Instant Criminal Background System (NICS) checks, more ATF agents, funding “smart gun” research, expanding background checks to trusts, etc.  According to The Hill, Tuesday’s budget proposal seeks “$1. 3 billion” for the ATF alone. “  million” of those dollars would go to funding the new ATF agents in the roles outlined the executive gun controls. Budget monies are also being sought for the “mental health” aspects of Obama’s gun controls —  this includes the gun ban for some Social Security beneficiaries, which was   into the list of executive controls. Republicans criticized the requests for gun control funding, but House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) has yet to say whether he actually plans to fight funding the executive controls.
