Two nuns have enlisted the help of the Pope’s personal lawyer to fight a court case against Katy Perry’s attempts to buy a former convent, describing the singer as “disgusting” and accusing her of “witchcraft,” according to a report. [The Daily Mail reports that the    singer is facing a legal challenge from the Order of the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary over her attempt to buy the $14. 5 million property, situated in Los Angeles’ Los Feliz neighborhood, which was formerly lived in by Sisters Rose Catherine Holzman, 86, and Rita Callanan, 78.  “I do not like Katy Perry’s lifestyle,” Callanan told the paper. “I gave a lot of the things from the internet to show the Archdiocese what kind of woman she was. Some of the things she does are disgusting. ” During her first encounter with the singer, Callanan said that Perry was eager to show her a tattoo on her wrist with the name Jesus, and the singer said she planned to buy the property so she could “sit down and drink green tea, and just go to the meditation garden and just meditate. ” Sister Callanan also expressed her disapproval at the singer’s alleged involvement with witchcraft from the time Perry visited Salem, Massachusetts, a town known as ‘The City of Witches,” for the “Salem Witch Walk” in 2014. Though the singer told the nuns she couldn’t remember being in Salem for the “Witch Walk,” Perry was photographed there. THE REVOLUTION IS COMING.  —   KATY PERRY (@katyperry) November 9, 2016,
