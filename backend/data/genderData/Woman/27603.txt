Black Lives Matter protesters interrupted and seized a demonstration in support of Apple’s resistance against the FBI to create a government backdoor to phone encryption in Chicago on Tuesday. [The protest started on Michigan Avenue with around fifteen people in support of computer giant Apple after their refusal to cooperate with the FBI’s request for private customer device information and data from the San Bernardino gunman’s iPhone.  At around 5:30pm, a significant amount of Black Lives Matter protesters reportedly hijacked the event with their own demonstration over Laquan McDonald, who was repeatedly shot by a Chicago police officer in 2014. Witnesses claimed an American flag was set on fire, as well as protesters tussling with police and refusing to unblock paths for local pedestrians. “It’s a little frustrating to us that it wasn’t as helpful for us to get our message out,” stated Apple protester Ryan Kolak. “But I’m always in support of people being able to speak their mind and being able to have the ability to make their voice heard. ” No police officers or civilians are reported to have been injured, but one protester was brought into custody.
