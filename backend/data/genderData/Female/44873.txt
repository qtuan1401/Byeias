’  ’ ’       For decades, American women have gradually pushed back the       age at which they choose to become parents.     ’ ’       Now, for the first time, women in their 30s are having more       children than those in their 20s, according to preliminary       2016 data released by the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention on Wednesday.     ’ ’       The CDC data        that the birth rate among women aged 30 to 34 last year just       barely surpassed that of women aged 25 to 29, the demographic       with the highest birth rate for more than three decades.       While women in the early thirties bracket had about 103       births per 100, 000 people, the rate for women in their late       twenties was 102 per 100, 000. On average, the CDC data       suggests, women are having their first child at roughly age       28.     ’ ’       That means that   mothers are older, broadly       speaking, than they were  when the CDC put the       average age of first birth at 26. 3. The change is due in       large part to a continuing decline in the teen birth rate.       Though the CDC has not yet released a full report for 2016,       it found a 42 percent drop in the rate of   births       among teens between 2000 and 2014.     ’ ’       But the growing number of   parents over 30 are also       shifting the CDC’s statistics. In some sectors of American       life —  especially among more affluent and highly educated       women —  social norms around age and motherhood have changed       with remarkable speed. As one woman who works in media        about getting pregnant at 27: “The reaction to my       pregnancy was neatly split along demographic lines. When I       told people over the age of 40 that I was pregnant, they were       delighted. People under the age of 40, however, were       horrified. ”     ’ ’       In many ways, this attitude, and the milestone marked by the       new CDC data, represents a gain for women. As Rebecca       Traister wrote in her 2016 book  the social permission to delay       marriage and childbirth —  as well the as the biological ability       to do so, first through the use of reliable birth control,       now with the help of the booming fertility industry —  has given       women the freedom to define themselves through means other       than motherhood. As recently as 1970,  was just 21, giving most women       precious little time to pursue education, adventure, and       professional achievement.     ’ ’       However, the rise of older parenthood is also a response to a       workplace paradigm that levies penalties on mothers. The U. S.       is  in the world without a federal paid       parental leave policy, and childcare in this country is        and . Together, these factors push many women       to put off pregnancy in the name of professional success or       financial stability.     ’ ’  ’ ’       In her 2012 book        University of Houston professor Elizabeth Gregory analyzed       census data from 2000 and found that delaying motherhood       measurably increased women’s earnings.     ’ ’       Comparing   professional women, all of whom had       advanced degrees and were between the ages of 40 and 45, she       found that those who’d become parents at 35 were making an       average of $50, 000 a year more than those who’d had their       first child at 20. Even women who’d given birth for the first       time at age 30 were making, on average, $16, 000 less each       year than women who had delayed parenthood by an additional       five years. Gregory posited that women who’d become mothers       in their    30s had had time to accrue a “shadow       benefits system”: clout, expertise, and perhaps bargaining       power or flexibility that helped to replace the official       benefits that most American workplaces lack.     ’ ’       Older parenthood is not an unalloyed good. In most cases,       fertility begins to decline in a woman’s thirties. For those       who cross this threshold without realizing it, turning to       fertility drugs or technology such as IVF can be miserably       difficult and ruinously expensive. And as many people wait       longer to have families, family size is . Currently, the U. S. birthrate still exceeds       the replacement rate; falling below it might be desirable       from an environmental perspective but disadvantageous from an       economic and social one, as   .     ’ ’       For many women, waiting to have children is both an       emancipatory and a practical choice. But only good policy       will free women to shape their families as they see fit —  and       even, in some cases, to start them younger.     ’ ’For decades, American women have gradually. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
