Some would say that the true stars of this year’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, which arrived in New York this week, are the cats. Featured as part of a collaboration with the International Cat Association, the cats drew consternation from some dog handlers, who felt the parvenus did not belong. The cats, being cats, did not care. They dressed up or dressed down, leapt through the occasional hoop and gazed witheringly on the efforts of their human and canine compatriots. Oh, to be a cat and be above it all. For the photographer Vincent Tullo, the cats offered another attraction as well: They brought him and his camera to the show’s fringes, where the   discipline of the main events gave way to curious hoodies and whimsy. “The cat people were much more playful than the dog people,” said Mr. Tullo, who is a dog owner. “I’d go to the cat section, and all the owners were laughing. The judges were laughing. Then I’d go to the dog section, and people would get mad at you for taking pictures of their dog. It’s a little strange that people take a puppy this seriously. The dogs want to relax and play. They try to walk over to you and sniff you, and the owners pull them back. ” The truly exotic creatures at the event, of course, are the handlers, who spend four hours or more wetting and drying their dogs’ hair for the grooming competition. Before the dogs’ agility competition, handlers were given the opportunity to practice the obstacle course  —   but without their dogs. “It was the weirdest thing,” Mr. Tullo said. “There were 20 or 30 people running in circles, saying, ‘Good boy,’ and not a single dog in sight. ” The cats, no doubt, had a good chuckle at that one.
