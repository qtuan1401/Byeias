As the Toronto Blue Jays head to Cleveland for Games 1 and 2 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) one announcer is refusing to say the team’s name on air. [Longtime Blue Jays announcer Jerry Howarth said on The Jeff Blair Show Thursday that he will refrain from saying “Indians” on air during the games against Cleveland, WKYC reports.  Howarth told the radio show he made the decision more than 20 years ago because the term is found offensive by the First Nations people. Howarth said he also does not refer to the Atlanta Braves during games. Howarth shared that he was deeply touched by a letter he received in the   from a fan who was a member of a First Nation who said he was offended when terms such as “Braves” and “Indians” were used in games. “For the rest of my career I will not say ‘Indian’ or ‘Brave’ and if I was in the NFL I would not say ‘Redskins,’” Howarth told The Toronto Star, referring to the Washington football team.
