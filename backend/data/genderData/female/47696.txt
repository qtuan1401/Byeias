’  ’ ’   A quote that Bruno   believes  happens to be ”mind is everything. .. if   you didn’’t achieve something, you simply didn’’t believe in it   enough.” ’ ”   This quote hit home for the Spanish sprinter when he learned in a     interview that he was the European Champion at 200   meters, because at first, he simply didn’t believe it.  ” ”   At this week’s European Championships in Amsterdam, Hortelano   finished second in the 200m dash. Nobody bothered to tell   him that Churancy Martina, who beat him by a mere . 08 seconds,   had been disqualified for stepping out of his lane.  ” ’   After he was informed of the disqualification, Hortelano   corrected the interviewer by insisting that he had won silver and   not gold. It was ”a dream” to finished second, said Hortelano.   However, after seeing the result before his own eyes, an excited   Hortelano celebrated by doing exactly what he does best:   sprinting away.  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’     ’ ’   In addition to winning his first European Championship title,   Hortelano established a new Spanish national record by running   20. 39 seconds in the semifinals.  ’ ’   Hortelano is a former   Sprinter at Cornell University   where he graduated in 2014 as a Biological Engineering major. He   will compete again this summer in the 100m and 200m dashes at the   2016 Summer Olympic Games. ’ ’   ”Honestly, I feel numb. It’’s really surreal. The most amazing   part of this has been feeling the support from all over the globe     for that I’’m incredibly grateful,” Hortelano told Business   Insider. ’
