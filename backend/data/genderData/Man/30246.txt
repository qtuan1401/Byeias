During her “Opening Statement” Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” Judge Jeanine Pirro blasted the cast of Hamilton for its Friday night message to Vice   Mike Pence.  Pirro called the cast’s lecture “outrageous and embarrassing. ” “The treatment of Vice   Mike Pence last night in New York City where he was booed on the way into the play Hamilton, and lectured from the stage on his way out, was both outrageous and embarrassing,” Pirro said. “What happened in that theater, one block from this studio was out and out reverse racism and teed up hate for a man who has done nothing to deserve this inappropriate and disgusting behavior by those who take it upon themselves to use what was supposed to be a night of art and recreation and appreciation for our American history as a political bully pulpit to chide the incoming vice president. ” Pirro then pointed out the hypocrisy of the Democrats because they preach love but then boo Pence at the theater. She continued, “What happened to your old, ‘Love trumps hate’ line? You’re all damn hypocrites. You think that you and people who think like you are the only ones who deserve respect. ” “[T]hey didn’t just reject your presidential candidate, they rejected your senate, your house, and your governorship. Get used to it! And I’ve got news for you. Don’t lecture this man. You may know a little about hip hop and dancing around the stage. I majored in American History and I saw the play Hamilton, and I loved it. But you just took the fun, the enjoyment and the memory of that play right out of me. Which might explain why the number one hashtag that’s trending right now is is #BoycottHamilton,” Pirro concluded. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
