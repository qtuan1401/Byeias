Among the many bombshell revelations pouring out of the   FBI report on Hillary Clinton’s email server is an amusingly blatant admission that her data was deliberately, and very thoroughly, wiped out shortly after the   ClintonEmail. com server was discovered. [It doesn’t get more blatant than a staffer  —   whose name is redacted, but might be Bryan Pagliano, the IT staffer who invoked the Fifth Amendment over 125 times to avoid giving testimony on his actions  —   admitting he had an “oh, sh*t” moment when he realized her emails might still be where Congress, the FBI, and the American people could get at them:  A few weeks after the NYT disclosed that Hillary Clinton had a private email account, her archive inbox was deleted. pic. twitter.   —   Matt Viser (@mviser) September 2, 2016,  Remember, when Clinton was asked if her server had been wiped, she acted dumb and replied, “What, like with a cloth or something?” And here we have Clinton’s operatives scrambling to use not a cloth, but BleachBit  —   which, as House Benghazi Chairman Trey Gowdy observed, is not the sort of utility one uses to blow up “yoga emails or bridesmaid’s emails,” but rather for “something you really do not want the world to see. ” Another convenient feature of BleachBit, as expounded by its creator: it’s a free, anonymous, untraceable download, so there is no “money trail” that could connect Clinton or her staff to the tools. Not only that, but backups of the data were deliberately destroyed as well, right about the time the Clinton email scandal grew into a story her friendly media clearly couldn’t ignore to death.
