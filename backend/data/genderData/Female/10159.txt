”You can be nasty about it or you can listen to me” @mkhammer jabs at @ChrisCuomo in morning health care discussion https:  .  Things got a little heated Thursday on CNN’s “New Day. ”  In a debate about health care, host Chris Cuomo insulted network contributor Mary Katharine Ham by calling her “cheap. ” “[Y]ou can be nasty about it or you can listen to me,” Ham responded. “I am a person, single mom of two, who has lost three or four plans since Obamacare passed,” she added. “I was told I would not. That was a lie. When I said that I would lose my plan, people called me a liar when this was going on. I have had a 160 percent increase in my premiums. I was told those would go down, and I’ve had a 300 percent increase in my deductible. One of the ways you can fix that is by cutting some of these ‘essential health benefits’ because they are indeed not essential. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Breitbart. tv on @BreitbartVideo
