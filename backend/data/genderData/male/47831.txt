’  ’ ’   Alphabet can be pretty confusing. ’ ’   No, not the alphabet. I mean the Alphabet with a   capital ”A”.  ’ ’   It is the parent company of Google,  in a huge overhaul of   the Californian tech giant. (The change was first announced in   August 2015, but took time to come into effect.) ’ ’   Google is now just one letter of this Alphabet, with other   divisions and projects not part of Google’’s core products spun   out into separate ”Alphabet companies,” each with their own   CEO.  ’ ’   Alphabet gives its CEO Larry Page and the senior leadership   significantly more freedom to chase exciting projects and   acquisitions  —   regardless of how they fit into Google’’s mission   ”to organise the world’s information and make it universally   accessible and useful.” ’ ’   Healthcare research? Sure. Improving cities? Why not. Radical   life extension? Sounds like fun! ’ ’    ’ ’  ’ ’     ’
