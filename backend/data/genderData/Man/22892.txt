Former NYPD Detective Bo Dietl spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Monday about the weekend terror attacks in New York City, stating, “When is the political correctness going to stop already? ”[Dietl added, “When are we going to wake up? And I really believe this is part of a larger cell in New York. Only by the grace of God the second bomb didn’t go off. Just imagine having ten bombs around New York.  “When you use the word ‘profile,’” Dietl went on, “well, what am I supposed to do —  go into an Irish neighborhood and look for terrorists?” He added: They hang around among themselves, around the Muslim community. We need the Muslim community in America that loves this country   …     to step up and let us know what’s happening in the community with these people who, effectively, want to change our life the way we know it.
