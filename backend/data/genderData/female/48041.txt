’  ’ ’   An employee of Bridgewater Associates who filed a     complaint against his supervisor has withdrawn   the claim and started a new job at   firm   KKR. ’ ”   With about $150 billion under management, Westport,     Bridgewater is the world’s largest hedge fund. ” ’   Chris Tarui filed a complaint earlier this year with a   Connecticut agency, alleging the harassment and describing   Bridgewater as a ”cauldron of fear and intimidation”   that kept him silent. ’ ’   Tarui, who raised money for the hedge fund, withdrew his claim   earlier this week and did not receive any financial compensation   from the firm, a Bridgewater spokesman said. ’ ”   Bridgewater also agreed to withdraw Tarui’s employment   restrictions, the spokesman added. Typically, Bridgewater   employees are bound to noncompete agreements. The supervisor who   is alleged to have harassed Tarui is still employed at the hedge   fund. ” ’’ ’   After the  ’ ’  ’ ’   Like many companies, Bridgewater requires workers to agree   to settle claims in private arbitration, keeping matters out of   public view. The public agency filing in Connecticut,   however, revealed the details of the allegations. ’ ’   Reached by telephone, Tarui declined to comment. His    says that he started as a director at     firm KKR this month. A KKR spokeswoman confirmed the move. ’
