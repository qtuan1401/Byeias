 (CNN) Here’s a look at the life of Michael Skakel, the nephew of Ethel Kennedy. Skakel was convicted in 2002 of the 1975 murder of his neighbor, Martha Moxley. Skakel continues to appeal his conviction and sentence. Personal:Birth date: September 19, 1960  Birth place: Greenwich, Connecticut, Birth name: Michael Skakel, Father: Rushton Skakel Sr. Mother: Anne Skakel, Marriage: Margot Sheridan (  divorced) Children: George, 1999, Education: Curry College, Milton, Massachusetts, B. A. 1993, Other Facts:Both Skakel and victim Martha Moxley were 15 years old at the time, and lived near each other in Greenwich, Connecticut. His older brother, Tommy, and their   tutor, Kenneth Littleton, were also suspects. Prosecutors claimed Skakel killed Moxley in a jealous rage.  Dominick Dunne’s bestselling 1993 novel ”A Season in Purgatory” is based on the case. Timeline:October 30, 1975   Martha Moxley fails to return home after her evening out concludes with a stop at the Skakel home to visit Tommy and Michael Skakel, Kennedy nephews by marriage. October 31, 1975   Martha’s body is discovered. She was beaten to death with a golf club, which is found near her body. Tommy Skakel is questioned by the police. 1978   Skakel is charged with drunken driving. To sidestep a prosecution, Skakel family attorneys work out a deal with police: he will go to the Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine, to be treated for alcohol addiction and the state will not pursue the charges. 1994   Skakel works as an aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy’s   campaign. 1998   Two books based on the crime are published   ”Greentown,” by Timothy Dumas, and ”Murder in Greenwich,” by Mark Fuhrman. June 1998   Superior Court Judge George Thim begins an     grand jury review of information gathered by investigators.  January 19, 2000   An arrest warrant for an unnamed individual is issued in the Moxley murder. Later the same day, Skakel surrenders to police and is released on $500, 000 bond. June 21, 2000    At a   hearing, two of Skakel’s former classmates at the Elan School in Maine testify that he had confessed to them back in the 1970s, ”I’m gonna get away with murder. I’m a Kennedy.” May 7, 2002   Testimony begins in the case. June 7, 2002   Skakel is convicted. August 29, 2002   Skakel is sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.  November 24, 2003   Attorneys file an appeal, seeking to overturn his murder conviction. January 13, 2006   The conviction is upheld by the Connecticut Supreme Court. November 13, 2006   The US Supreme Court declines to hear Skakel’s appeal, meaning his conviction still stands. April 17, 2007   Skakel’s petition for a new trial begins. Former high school classmate Gitano ”Tony” Bryant says two of his friends were involved in the murder, not Skakel. October 25, 2007   The petition for new trial is denied as the judge finds statements not credible that Bryant and his two friends, all   could go unnoticed in the mostly white neighborhood. November 6, 2007   Skakel’s lawyers file a writ of habeas corpus and petition for a new trial in federal district court. September 27, 2010   Skakel’s lawyers file a new appeal claiming that his trial attorney, Mickey Sherman, was incompetent in that he failed to obtain evidence from prosecuting attorneys pointing to other suspects, and that Sherman’s own financial problems drew his focus away from the case.  Sherman had plead guilty in June to failing to pay $400, 000 in federal income taxes. February 8, 2011   Skakel testifies in his appeal hearing, the fourth attempt at overturning his conviction.  March 6, 2012   His appeal is denied by a   panel of the Connecticut Supreme Court. October 24, 2012   Skakel is denied parole by the state parole board in Suffield, Connecticut. October 23, 2013   A Connecticut Appellate judge orders a new trial for Skakel, saying defense attorney Mickey Sherman’s representation of Skakel was ”constitutionally deficient.”  November 21, 2013   Skakel is released after his bail is posted. Superior Court Judge Gary White sets several conditions for the bail, including barring Skakel from leaving Connecticut without court approval, ordering him to wear a GPS tracking device and requiring that he report to a bail commissioner. August 8, 2014   Prosecutors file an appeal to reinstate Skakel’s conviction of killing Martha Moxley in 1975. If the appeal fails, prosecutors state they will retry Skakel. December 30, 2016   The Connecticut Supreme Court reinstates Skakel’s 2002 murder conviction in a   decision, reversing the Appellate court’s order for a new trial in 2013. The final version of the court’s decision is released on May 8, 2017. January 6, 2017   Skakel’s attorneys file a motion to reconsider the ruling of the Connecticut Supreme Court and requesting a seven member court panel hear the motion to ensure a ”full and fair determination.” The argument raises an unprecedented issue, as the judge who authored the majority decision retired from the court and cannot participate in any future decisions.
