Rapper and TV personality Nick Cannon is not backing away from his claim that Planned Parenthood is committing “genocide” against black people, insisting further that the abortion provider promotes “population control. ”[Asked by a TMZ reporter to elaborate further on the topic, Cannon said, “Yeah, it’s population control. ”  When pressed further, the America’s Got Talent host said Planned Parenthood engages in “modern day eugenics. ” The    TV star first accused Planned Parenthood of inflicting “real genocide” on black Americans during an interview last week with “The Breakfast Club” radio show. “Hillary was sneaking and cheating,” Cannon said. “Think about all the stuff they did with Planned Parenthood and all that type of stuff. That type of stuff is to take our community  —   and forget gentrification, it’s real genocide, and it’s been like that for years. ” Cannon appears to be referring to Planned Parenthood’s genesis in the early 20th century. Planned Parenthood was founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger in October 1916. More than 100 years later, the   organization performs over 300, 000 abortions per year in the United States  —   making it the country’s largest abortion provider. According to the 2010 census, some 79 percent of Planned Parenthood’s abortion facilities are located within walking distance of black or Latino neighborhoods. Of the 59 million abortions performed since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, more than 18 million of them have been of black children. Today, about 30 percent of all abortions in the U. S. are performed on black women, while another 25 percent are performed on Hispanic women, Breitbart News has reported.
