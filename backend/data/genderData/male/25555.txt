AE is set to debut a weekly live documentary series titled Live PD, which will “highlight the difficult work being done by our men and women in uniform” by placing viewers inside some of America’s most active police departments and giving audiences a look inside the communities they patrol. [Network executives said the series is meant to provide context to the attention surrounding the debate in America over excessive force and policing.  “Every day the demands for more transparency in law enforcement continues to come from both civilians and police across the country,” said Rob Sharenow, executive vice president and general manger of AE and Lifetime. “Live PD will not only highlight the difficult work being done by our men and women in uniform as they go out into the streets never knowing what to expect, but also answers citizens’ calls for clarity. ” Former news executive producer at CNN, ABC, and NBC, David Doss, takes the helm as show runner for the series. “Live PD will go beyond the linear experience,” an AE Networks release said Monday. “A live social media component will take audiences behind the scenes of the Live PD studio to pull back the curtain of the groundbreaking series. ” Journalist Dan Abrams, ABC’s chief legal affairs anchor and a   veteran news journalist, will host Live PD from inside the studio alongside Dallas Police Department detectives Rich Emberlin and Kevin Jackson. Detectives Jackson and Emberlin, expert law enforcement officers with decades of experience  —   having served together in Patrol, SWAT and Criminal Intelligence for the Dallas Police Department  —   will offer live commentary for the show. Live PD will premiere Friday, October 28 at 9 PM and will be presented in eight   episodes.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson
