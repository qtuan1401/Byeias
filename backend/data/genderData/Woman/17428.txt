Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) does not believe that President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice to replace Justice Antonin Scalia who passed away on Saturday. [“I do not believe the president should appoint someone. And it’s not unprecedented,” he said during the CBS debate tonight. “In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice. ”  Rubio praised Scalia as a justice who stood strong for the original interpretation of the Constitution instead of the “fads of the moment. ” “He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic,” Rubio said. He reminded viewers of the debate that the election became more important than ever. “We need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document,” he said. “It is to be interpreted as originally meant. ”
