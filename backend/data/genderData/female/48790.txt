’  ’ ’   All the attention is on Hurricane Matthew as it nears a    up the Florida coast, starting in the   early hours of Friday morning. ’ ’   And rightly so. This storm could be a  for Florida. ’ ’   But you may have heard about another hurricane out there,   Hurricane Nicole. ’ ”   Upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane from a tropical storm   Thursday, Nicole isn’t projected to make landfall anywhere  —     except, perhaps, eventually Bermuda. ” ”   But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter. ” ”   Nicole is hot on Matthew’s heels in the Atlantic, and it’s   interfering with the larger storm’s path. ” ’   Take a look at this projection: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tComplicated relationship   Hurricanes Matthew & Nicole + high pressure.     > increasing likelihood of S.

(Fortunately, Matthew   will likely be much weaker at that point.) ’ ”   Keep in mind that these projections point deep into next week,   and hurricane models are generally only considered solid   three days into the future. This is an unusual, dangerous   situation in many respects, and we’ll have to wait to know for   sure how the two storms will interact. ” ”   So while few people should feel or see Nicole directly, the   smaller storm will play a role in Matthew’s path  —   however it   plays out. ”
