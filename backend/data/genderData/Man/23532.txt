Correct the Record, a   Clinton political action committee (PAC) is spending over $1 million on online trolls in order to ‘correct’ Bernie Sanders supporters on social media sites. [The PAC this week launched an initiative called “Barrier Breakers 2016,” which is composed of a “task force” that will debate ‘Bernie Bros,’ presumably supporters of the Senator Sanders’s campaign, as referred to by their official press release.  According to Correct the Record, the task force will “combat online political harassment,” boasting that it has already “addressed more than 5, 000 individuals who have personally attacked Secretary Clinton on Twitter. ” “The task force will provide a presence and space online where Clinton supporters can organize and engage with one another and are able to obtain graphics, videos, gifs, and messaging to use in their own social spaces,” the group states. “Additionally, the Barrier Breakers 2016 task force hopes to embrace the creativity of Hillary Clinton’s supporters by sharing their efforts and content with other groups,” it continues. “Barrier Breakers 2016 is focused on pushing out positive content to Hillary supporters online to counter negative attacks and false narratives,” Correct the Record’s communications director, Elizabeth Shappell, told The Daily Beast. “The expanded task force was established in anticipation of the general election. ” According to Campaign Legal Center lawyer Paul Ryan, Correct the Record is “creating new ways to undermine campaign regulation. ” However, it is understood the Federal Electoral Commission will not be investigating the matter.
