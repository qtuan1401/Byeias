During testimony before Congress on Thursday, FBI Director James Comey said that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is not as “technically sophisticated” as “people would assume about somebody with that background. ”  Comey was asked, “[A] few minutes ago, you also stated that you now believe that Hillary Clinton is not nearly as sophisticated as people thought. Is that correct?” He responded, “Yeah, I think that’s fair  —   actually, no, not as people thought, but as people would assume about somebody with that background. I’m sorry, I should be clear about this, technically sophisticated. I’m not opining on other kinds of sophistication. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
