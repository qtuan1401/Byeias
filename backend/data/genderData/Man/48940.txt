’  ’ ”   It’s a very good night to be a rocket geek on the East Coast. ” ’   As Maddie Stone  over at Gizmodo, an Antares rocket   launch at 7:40 p. m. just off the coast of Maryland   should be visible across much of the    —   even for a   few moments from places as far from the launch site as South   Carolina, Pittsburgh, and Boston. The rocket will be on its way   to the International Space Station with supplies 5, 290 pounds of   supplies and science experiments, after delays due   to  and a . ’ ”   Here’s a map of the regions that should be able to view the   launch, as long as it’s a clear night: ” ’  ’ ’   The farther from the center, the lower it will appear over the   horizon. So unless you live in a flat, treeless plain you may   want to get on top of something tall for ideal viewing. ’ ”   Here’s when the rocket should first become visible from each   area: ” ’  ’ ’   The best views should be from areas fairly close to the Wallops   Island, Virginia launch site, like Baltimore, Norfolk,   Virginia, and Philadelphia. But New York City, Harrisburg, and   Raleigh should get a decent view of the action as well. ’ ”   Of course, it won’t look like a big machine riding a column of   fire unless you’re very close. Expect it to look   more like a glowing streak across the sky above the horizon. ”
