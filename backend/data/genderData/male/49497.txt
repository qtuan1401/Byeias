’  ’ ’   While financial, industrial and small cap stocks in the US have   been partying like it’s 1979, investors would be wise to take   more than a passing look across the Atlantic at Europe’s next   biggest threat. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   There’s more to it, but that gives a general sense. This bill is   vast and complex, making a vote on it challenging as voters are   unable to decide between the changes they support and those they   don’t; it is all or nothing. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Investors need to care about this because the market has decided   that this vote is an indicator of Italy’s ability to make much   needed reforms and that matters because of the impact of Italy’s   banks and sovereign debt. The actual quality or validity of the   reforms proposed in the referendum have become almost   meaningless. For those within Italy the vote has become a   referendum on Renzi and as Italians grow increasingly frustrated   that their lives haven’t materially improved, even some members   of Congress from within Renzi’s own party who originally voted   for the referendum are now scrambling to develop compelling   arguments for why they now oppose it. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   If contrary to the polls the “yes” vote wins, Italian bonds and   banks will rally and the MIB (Italian stock index) will have a   huge relief rally, particularly given its   to banks,   and the euro will likely strengthen relative to other currencies. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
