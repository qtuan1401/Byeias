Newly crowned UK Independence Party leader Diane James has resigned. The party has not yet made a statement. [Rumours spread earlier on Tuesday about Ms. James being unhappy about signing a “fairly straightforward” document which formally handed her control of the party.  Ms. James is said to have initially refused to sign the paperwork, then adding “under duress” when told she could not assume leadership of the party without doing so. Party sources tell Breitbart London the documentation was “fairly straightforward” and they did not understand her reluctance, though Breitbart London understands that Ms. James resigned for personal reasons related to her family. UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe is understood to be eyeing up the role again after he was blocked by the party’s National Executive Committee from standing in the last leadership election. Party sources are also floating UKIP’s London Mayoral candidate and London Assembly Member Peter Whittle as a possible successor. Ms. James reportedly cut her own campaign team out of the loop several days ago, and the party is said to have been aware of the situation for at least the entirety of Tuesday. Ms. James becomes yet another UKIP leader to fail to succeed Nigel Farage. In 2015 Suzanne Evans lasted three days before being ousted by the National Executive Committee in favour of bringing Mr. Farage back. Ms. James’s de facto tenure has been just 18 days. It is unclear what the party’s internal process is for selecting another leader. The last process, held just one month ago, was   and costly. The party is said to have limited funds and is therefore keen to avoid another full membership ballot. ++ DEVELOPING ++
