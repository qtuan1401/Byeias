Thursday on ABC’s “The View”   Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg agreed Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton is not resonating with voters on the campaign trail.  Goldberg said, “Hillary Clinton has not been able to get her message out, apparently, in an effective way, according to a lot of folks. So I ask you what do you think she needs to do to resonate because there’s a debate tonight. What does she need to do to resonate with the voters?” Behar added, “Bernie has a very specific message. He keeps talking about income equality and free college. Her messages are a little mushy. She’s good at a lot of things, she’s experienced, she’s really brilliant, but she needs to focus more and have one or two or three things that she keeps repeating the way Bernie does. ”     asked, “Why do you think she doesn’t have that? She knows how to be a part of a campaign. ” Behar continued, “Because she’s a wonk. She’s wonky. She’s an intellectual. You know what I mean? She talks like a politician  …    She needs to appeal to young women. They’re having trouble with her. She’s got to hone in on what you want to say to the American people specifically and stop being all over the place. ” Goldberg added, “She’s not a great communicator. You know she’s not a great communicator. I think she is more than qualified for the job. It’s just, you know, she says what she needs to say and she’s not good at like extra  —   this is not her, the    it doesn’t work for her. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
