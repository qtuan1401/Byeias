Vice President Joe Biden called Friday for a ban on “civilian ownership” of “assault weapons” and “high capacity” magazines. [He called for the ban after a WhiteHouse. gov petition for an “assault weapons” ban garnered more than 185, 000 signatures. And that sounds like a lot of signatures, but it is a small proportion of the population of the United States, now 320, 000, 000.  According to ABC News, “Biden says Congress should renew the expired assault weapons ban. ” Biden also said Congress should expand background checks to cover all sales —  private and retail. He did not mention that the Orlando attacker bought his guns at retail, also passed a background check to acquire them, and also submitted to a waiting period for a handgun before taking it home. Biden also wants a ban on “high capacity” magazines and he wants persons “terror watch lists” to be barred from buying guns, although many of those people have never been convicted of a crime. Breitbart News previously reported that Senator Dianne Feinstein ( ) is pushing for a watch list comprised of persons who used to be on watch lists. They, too, would be banned from purchasing guns.
