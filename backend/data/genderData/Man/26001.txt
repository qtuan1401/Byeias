Per a KCTV5 report, a woman in Oklahoma City, OK is accused of forcing a crucifix down her daughter’s throat and watching her die.  Court documents say Juanita Gomez attacked her    daughter, Geneva Gomez, because she was “possessed by the devil. ” “She kept mumbling ‘devil’ and ‘money,’” described Frankie Merlos, boyfriend of Geneva Gomez for five years. Merlos says he tried to leave and call police, but Juanita Gomez attacked him, too. “I just shoved her, pushed her out of the way so I could run, and then she tried to, like, choke me. I ran to the car, and locked the car, and called 911,” he recalled. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
