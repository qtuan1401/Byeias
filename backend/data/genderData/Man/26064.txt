During a conversation about San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s protests, rapper Lil Wayne was asked Tuesday on Fox Sports 1’s “Undisputed” what he had seen regarding race relations in his life.  Lil Wayne began by saying people would not want to hear his answer because he has been blessed his whole life, but he said he has never dealt with racism. “Skip, they wouldn’t want to ask me that. They wouldn’t want my answer to represent it because God knows I have been nothing but blessed my whole path. These 33 years have been nothing but a blessing. I have never  —   never is a strong word  —   never dealt with racism, and I’m glad I didn’t have to. I don’t know if it’s because of my blessings, but it is my reality. So I would have to say, not only I thought it was over, I still believe it’s over, but, obviously, it isn’t,” he told   Skip Bayless. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
