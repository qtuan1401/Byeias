[In an interesting fusion of religion and science, the robot is the product of a collaboration between a tech company and AI experts from China’s top universities.  The bot is named after its creator, Master Xianfan, who believes “science and Buddhism are not opposing nor contradicting, and can be combined and mututally compatible. ”  Standing at   tall, Xian’er sports a touch screen on his chest yet maintains a traditional look with yellow robes and a shaven head.

It is a kind of elevated culture. Speaking from this perspective, I think it can satisfy the needs of many people. ” The temple is already working on an updated version of Xian’er, which will include several new functions.
