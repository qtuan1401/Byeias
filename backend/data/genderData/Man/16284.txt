On Thursday’s “Axe Files” podcast, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough argued that President Obama is “our most Catholic of presidents. ”  McDonough said of Obama, “He talks a lot about dignity. He talks a lot about people being made in the image of God. He talks a lot about the need to treat each person with that respect that that demands. ” McDonough added, “I think this is the  —   our most Catholic of presidents. And I mean that by capital C Catholic, in what I see and what he does every day. It’s not to say that he’s  —   does everything entirely consistent with Catholic teaching. That’s not the idea. But I think, in fact his view of the person and his view of our role, and the view of us as adding to the common good, I think is an undeniably Catholic set of premises, and that’s why I say that to him a lot. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
