President Barack Obama and First Lady greeted Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle today, presenting a photo album to her as a gift to honor her 90th birthday.[ According to the White House, the customized photo album featured images “chronicling her visits with U. S. Presidents and First Ladies” likely including his own visit in 2009.   “The collection of historical photos in the album highlights the enduring close friendship between the United States and the United Kingdom,” the White House noted.  Obama was criticized in 2009 for presenting the Queen with an iPod as a gift, including audio files of his most important speeches.  The President and the First Lady had lunch with the Queen before departing to meet with Prime Minister David Cameron.
