On Friday’s broadcast of PBS’ “Washington Week,” Washington Post Political Correspondent Anne Gearan stated that when she took questions about her emails earlier in the day, Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “looked about as close to being in a hostage video as I’ve seen her” and “came very close to pointing fingers at Comey in a partisan way. ”  Gearan said, “Well, the campaign is doing a sort of a   version of what they have done in response to this email issue from  —   for a     now, which is, hunker down, investigate internally, think it through, issue an anodyne statement  —   in this case from John Podesta  —   and then work up to having Hillary Clinton say something herself. She looked about as close to being in a hostage video as I’ve seen her at that podium tonight. She took     minutes of questions. It wasn’t an extensive iteration of this. And she came very close to pointing fingers at Comey in a partisan way. She walked right up to the line of saying this is  —   this, in her view, is an inappropriate thing for him to be doing. She walked right up to that. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
