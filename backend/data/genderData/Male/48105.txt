’  ’ ’   Usain Bolt won the men’’s 100 meters on Sunday night in Rio in   convincing fashion, pulling away from the field to capture gold   in 9. 81 seconds and retain the title of ”World’’s Fastest Man.” ’ ’   With the win, Bolt becomes the first sprinter in history to win   gold in the 100 meters in three consecutive Olympics.  ’ ’   In the final, Bolt got off to a slow start, while American Justin   Gatlin looked to be closing in a surprise gold. But then Bolt   turned into his top gear, passing Gatlin and again crossing the   line well ahead of the field. ’ ’   ”I expected better,” Bolt said of himself, and his start, in a     interview with NBC. ’ ’   When he crossed the line, Bolt still had enough of an   edge of his competitors to pound his chest in victory: ’ ’  ’ ”   Here’s the finish: ” ’  ’ ’   Gatlin took silver. Andre De Grasse of Canada took bronze. ’ ’   After his win, Bolt celebrated with his famous     pose. This time, without shoes: ’ ’  ’ ’   Bolt entered the Rio Olympics as something of a question   mark, having dropped out of Jamaican Olympic qualifying five   weeks before the Games with a nagging hamstring injury. But   after being named to the Olympics by the Jamaican track and field   team, he has looked like his old self in Rio. ’ ’   In the preliminary round of the 100 meters on Saturday, Bolt   looked solid, practically jogging into the semifinal despite an   average start. Then, in the semifinal earlier on Sunday night, he   again cruised to victory,  and looking around at his competitors   as he effortlessly flew across the line. ’ ”   Bolt, who is nearly 30, still has the 200 meters and the   4x100m relay ahead of him in Rio. With his performance on   Sunday, Bolt has once again showed the world that he’s the best   sprinter to ever live. But was that ever really a doubt? ”
