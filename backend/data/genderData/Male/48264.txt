’  ’ ’     On May 20, about a month after UnitedHealthcare, one of the     country’s major health insurers, announced that it would pull     out of Arizona’s exchanges, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick  for     help.   ’ ’     It was addressed to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia     Mathews Burwell, and in her note Kirkpatrick, who had lost her     seat in the Tea Party putsch of 2010 in no small part because     of her vote in favor of health care reform, related her concern     about the wobblier parts of Obamacare.   ’ ’     “I represent a sprawling, mostly rural district in Arizona,”     wrote Kirkpatrick, the Democratic challenger for Sen. John     McCain’s seat this November. “In several counties, United     Healthcare is one of only two health insurance carriers selling     marketplace plans. ”   ’ ’     After noting that the Affordable Care Act has “significantly     dropped the uninsured rate in Arizona,” she addressed the     problems it’s still facing. “[W]hat can we do to incentivize     insurers to continue participation in the marketplace?” she     asked. “How can we ensure that the people in these rural     counties have sufficient choices in health care plans?”   ’ ’     The news in Arizona has only worsened since then. Blue Cross     Blue Shield, which had been the only carrier submitting 2017     insurance plans for all of Arizona’s counties —  at an average     requested  —  pulled its options for Maricopa County, by far the     state’s most populous, and the more rural Pinal County to its     south, citing $185 million in losses in the state  ’ ’     And last Monday, Aetna, another of the country’s largest     carriers, withdrew from markets in 11 of 15 states, including     Arizona. Aetna, suddenly bearish on the sustainability of the     exchanges where it had recently been so  made the     announcement not long after the Justice Department had     challenged its merger with the carrier Humana. The timing of     the move is now under . Whatever     hardball tactics Aetna may or may not have been employing don’t     change the fact that it was losing hundreds of millions of     dollars on the exchanges (on a of some $42 billion) and was     seeking consolidation as a remedy. With Aetna and     UnitedHealthcare out of the picture and Blue Cross paring back,     the competition in much of Arizona, particularly its rural     areas, will be sparse or nonexistent in 2017. And unless Blue     Cross, sniffing out a monopolistic business opportunity,     decides to   Pinal County will have no insurers     offering plans on its exchanges.   ’ ’     Is Obamacare working? The question assumes a single national     program. “There are, in some ways, 3, 000 different ACAs playing     out across the country, because it’s playing out very     differently county by county,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice     president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Some carriers,     especially in denser areas, are able to broaden their risk     pools and participate in flourishing exchanges, and some,     usually the less   ones that offer       plans at cheap cost, are making profits. Some 12. 7 million     people      through health exchanges in the 2016 open enrollment period,     with many millions more covered under the law’s Medicaid     expansion.   ’ ’  ’ ’     But it’s becoming clearer that the Affordable Care Act, for all     its advances, is due for the sort of legislative maintenance     that most major laws require after implementation. Two     temporary federal programs, designed to cushion losses for insurers as they     determined sustainable premium price points in new markets,     expire in 2017 as the exchanges enter their fourth year of     operation. Carriers serving    pools or rural     areas find that their options are either to sharply increase     premiums or to leave the exchanges altogether.   ’ ’     Average  on the individual exchanges are well into the     double digits across much of the country. And a  in May     projected the number of counties that could have a single     exchange insurer in 2017 to be 664 —  70 percent of which are     mostly rural —  up from 225 in 2016. That number will increase     following Aetna’s withdrawal and could reach roughly a quarter     of all counties in the country. Alabama, Alaska, South     Carolina, and Wyoming to have just one     insurer offering coverage on their exchanges in 2017. Most of     North Carolina, except for the Raleigh metropolitan region,      ’ ’     One problem with legislative redress for Obamacare is that the     legislators who are supposed to do the redressing seem less     than eager to return to the front where not long ago they’d     declared victory. The second problem is that, once again, the     fight will almost certainly involve the public option.   ’ ’     You remember the public option, don’t you? It’s exhausting just     to recall the debate. Despite the virtues of a       health care plan that, with lower     administrative costs, no profit expectations, and the     bargaining power of the federal government, would compete     aggressively alongside private plans, the debate over it was     the scene of much   and   last time     around. The public option’s ultimate exclusion from the ACA     remains, at least in some flawed tellings, the biggest knife     President Obama ever stuck in the back of the left. But now     both Obama and Hillary Clinton have come out in support of a     public option, and the Democratic caucus is not what it was in     2010.   ’ ’  ’ ’     “The book was really closed on health care reform issues since     Obamacare passed,” said Adam Green, a   of the     Progressive Change Campaign Committee. The progressive pressure     group, Green said, is considering a “big campaign on [the     public option] very soon” and released a statement following     Aetna’s announcement stressing the need for a public option.     Obama and Clinton’s support for the issue, he said, reopened     the book. “To have the two biggest figures in the Democratic     Party calling for it and a clear villain” —  Aetna —  “the stars are     aligned for a big campaign now. ” But are the Democrats ready?   ’ ’     The ACA is undoubtedly a mixed bag, and mixed bags always make     for terrible political discourse. Republicans wield each and     every suboptimal data point about the Affordable Care Act’s     implementation as concrete proof that the law has failed and     must be repealed in full if the republic is to survive, but     they offer no replacement plan that comes anywhere close to     meeting the ACA’s coverage figures. In the meantime, they     refuse to be party to any legislative improvements that might     shore up the program and help their rural constituents.   ’ ’     The debate over the public option was the scene of much       and   last time around.   ’ ’     Many Democrats, meanwhile, are content to hide behind     Republican incoherence and nefariousness instead of confronting     the shortcomings of their signature legislative achievement.     When I spoke with Kirkpatrick in late June and asked what     specific policy changes she would propose to prop up the     exchanges, she couldn’t name any off the top of her head —  though     she did point to the letter to demonstrate that she was asking     HHS for advisement. Instead she gave me the usual anecdotes     about people she’s met whose lives were saved by the coverage     they received under the ACA, and how the Republicans want to     reverse all of that.   ’ ’     It’s not that she —  or any of the other Democratic Senate     candidates I reached out to asking about specific policy     remedies they favor, to little response —  isn’t aware of the     problems or doesn’t care. (In a  Kirkpatrick, for example, wrote that she would     be “increasing pressure on the administration, state agencies     and insurance companies to work together to find a solution. ”)     But they still largely see the public battle as a foundational     one of protecting Obamacare’s existence against a Republican     Party that hasn’t accepted its legitimacy. This is a reasonable     position —  as well as an excuse for ignoring both the law’s     problems and certain politically inconvenient solutions. To     reopen the book, for many of them, is to reinvite the fury of     2010 that helped end Democratic control of the House of     Representatives and left Democrats with a bare majority in the     Senate. And the law’s approval rating is  ’ ’     All eyes now are on the 2017 open enrollment period that begins     Nov. 1. The key question is how consumers will navigate the     large projected premium increases, coupled, in many areas, with     fewer options. “If open enrollment goes well and more people     sign up, I expect a lot of these current concerns will fade,”     Levitt said. “If enrollment for 2017 stagnates, it’s likely to     trigger a debate about how to fix the law. And it’s not at all     clear where that debate would go. ” Republicans will be ready,     as always, with their recommendation to toss the whole act. How     will Democrats counter? =There is one Democratic figure     who might be in office in 2017 who has treated the law’s     shortcomings seriously and put together a bevy of health care     proposals —  and she happens to be the party’s presidential     nominee.   ’ ’     In the beginning of the campaign, Hillary Clinton, too,     suffered from the “everything is fine!” bug, going so far as to      Sen. Bernie Sanders over his        plan. Sanders’ specific proposal suffered from      But he     understood that though the ACA was a vast improvement on an     untenable status quo, its flaws really were flaws, and     it made little sense to avoid confronting them just because     doing so would be a pain. One staple of Sanders’ events during     the campaign was to ask members of his crowds to raise their     hands if they were facing sharp premium increases, and then to     say how large the increase was. There was never a shortage of     volunteers.   ’ ’     Eventually Clinton . It wasn’t the overhaul Sanders wanted, but     he gave      anyway. add a Medicare     “ ” option for those 55 and older, and she also committed     to doubling the money for community health centers from the     funding mark set in the original ACA, an important provision     won by Sanders in 2009. She offered further inducement for     states that haven’t already accepted the Medicaid expansion to     do so and would grant the HHS secretary additional “authority     to block or modify unreasonable health insurance premium rate     increases,” increase resources for enrollment outreach, and     expand existing exchange subsidies.   ’ ’  ’ ’     There is one Democratic figure who might be in     office in 2017 who has treated Obamacare’s shortcomings     seriously. She happens to be the party’s presidential nominee.   ’ ’     And yes, she’s also pledged to “pursue efforts to give     Americans in every state in the country the choice of     a   insurance plan. ”   ’ ’     It’s unclear how high a public option, and the political fight     that will come with it, ranks atop Clinton’s list of     priorities. But if 2017 open enrollment goes poorly and more     insurers flee the exchanges, the public option —  which has always      —  would be an     obvious   solution for restoring competition. The idea     doesn’t rely on   private insurers until they feel     properly incentivized to perform their societal function. It is     a direct delivery of health insurance plans to health     insurances exchanges. “Health care markets will inevitably     differ from region to region,” Jacob Hacker, the Yale professor     and   “father of the public option,”  “but there’s no reason every one of the existing     marketplaces couldn’t offer a   plan —  a plan that’s     stable; a plan with predictable costs; a plan that gives     patients a broad choice of providers just as Medicare does. ” It     would also save money according to a     2013 Congressional Budget Office estimate.   ’ ’     Progressives never gave up on the idea of the public option,     even after efforts to include it in the original ACA fell short     due to a combination of insurance industry pressure and       Democratic senators who were all afraid of being     called communists and losing their seats if they supported it.     (They were all called communists and lost their seats anyway.)     That’s one version of the story, at least.   ’ ’     The rise and fall of the public option is the subject of     volumes and volumes of folklore, at least half of which seem to     feature Rahm Emanuel (or Obama himself) in the role of the     heavy, rapping his brass knuckles against the desk of any     Democratic senator who entertained even a fleeting thought     about   health insurance. The truth,     as best it’s been reconciled, is that while President Obama     wanted a public option, what he wanted more was to keep     industry and his own party’s senators at the table to push a     law through. The public option was tradable.   ’ ’     “They wanted to keep those stakeholders in the room,” former     Sen. Tom Daschle, who played a    role in the     crafting and passage of the ACA,  “and this was the price some thought they had to     pay. ”   ’ ’  ’ ’     Industry pressure manifested itself through a handful of     conservative Democratic senators, all of whose votes were     needed to break a filibuster. Sens. Ben Nelson, Blanche     Lincoln, Mary Landrieu, Evan Bayh, and others all had their own     beefs with the public option, along with other       concerns that were addressed through a series of  If     one senator in particular deserved “credit” for killing the     public option, though, it was Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the     home of Yale University, the Bush dynasty, the original     hamburger, and the insurance giants Aetna and Cigna.   ’ ’     “The last bargain was with Joe Lieberman,” journalist Steven     Brill wrote in his 2015 history of the health care reform     battle, . “The     Connecticut senator finally got rid of the public option,     including a version that allowed individual states to choose to     implement it or not. ” (Much is made of the public option in the     bill that emerged from the House —  perhaps too much. In truth it     was a    plan that the Congressional Budget Office      would have premiums     “somewhat higher” than those of private insurers, not to     mention an unhealthier pool of enrollees.) Lieberman was also     responsible for the death of another provision that Hillary     Clinton has reintroduced this year in her health care plan: the     Medicare   for those ages 55 and older.   ’ ’     Joe Lieberman is no longer a senator. And with the       exits of UnitedHealthcare, Humana, and now Aetna from so many     exchanges, along with the collapse of nonprofit health     insurance   across the country, the talk of a nonprofit,       health insurance option has been     rekindled.   ’ ’     The most prominent endorsement of new efforts to pass a public     option came in the academic Journal of the     American Medical Association this summer from author     “Barack Obama, JD. ” “The public plan did not make it into the     final legislation,”  “Now, based on     experience with the ACA, I think Congress should revisit a     public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of     the country where competition is limited. ” It was quite a pivot     from the president who could turn snippy when pressed by     progressives  ’ ’     The main problem with Clinton’s plans for a public option, or     any other legislative patches to the ACA, or any other     legislative patches to anything —  the problem with passing     legislation, is the point —  would be congressional gridlock. But     it won’t even get to the point of gridlock and crushed dreams     if there’s not enough of an appetite within the Democratic     caucus even to try. In a piece last week, Bloomberg’s Jonathan     Bernstein  “most     likely to become new Democratic senators in 2017. ” Only six of     the 11 “had a ‘health care’ section on their websites. ” Only     one, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, “mentions support for a     public option on the issues section of his campaign website. ”   ’ ’     “This is the major option I’m pursuing,” Van Hollen told     Slate when asked for legislative remedies to the lack     of competition. He supported the public option in the original     Obamacare fight, and he supports it now. “The whole purpose of     having the public option in the first place was to, number one,     create competition in the exchanges and, two, to ensure that     there were insurance providers in every market. ”   ’ ’     Van Hollen, from   Maryland, is as close to a lock in     his Senate race as any Democrat this year. He has some room to     stretch out his arms. The enthusiasm for a public option among     those in closer races in purple states, though, is far more     muted.   ’ ”     When I asked the campaign of Deborah Ross, the North Carolina     Democratic Senate candidate seeking to unseat Sen. Richard     Burr, whether she would support a public option in light of the     limited insurance options in her state, she changed the     subject. “I am not for a single payer system, but I do want to     improve the ACA by giving consumers more options,” she said in     a statement. I am not a communist. I believe it     would be bad to move from a private health insurance market to     a   system. “Moreover,” she continued, “the     willingness of Aetna and other insurance companies to abandon     folks who need health insurance coverage is just another reason     it’s a bad idea to give Medicare away to the insurance     companies like Senator Burr has proposed. ” But I also     believe it would be bad to move Medicare to a private health     insurance market. The Democratic Senate campaigns of Katie     McGinty in Pennsylvania and Kirkpatrick in Arizona did not     respond to inquiries about support for the public option. And     the Florida Senate campaign of Rep. Patrick Murphy was     unwilling to commit to a position on the public option now,     even though during his     first House race in 2012.   ” ’  ’ ’     A lot of politicians are just getting reacquainted with the     issue and will have to properly “digest” it now as it’s       Adam Green said. “Since 2010, whenever somebody     tried to bring up the public option in D. C. Democratic     circles,” he said, “the answer was, ‘Yeah, we support that, but     first we’ve got to defend Obamacare.’ And now we’ve done that,     and now we’re ready to move on. ”   ’ ’     The best argument against pursuing a public option is that it     would be a waste of legislative time and capital, since there’s     no way it would pass Speaker Paul Ryan’s House of     Representatives (assuming that Republicans are able to hold the     chamber this fall). “The public option was a good idea in 2009,     and it’s a still a good idea today. [But] I don’t know that the     politics have changed at all on it,” Sen. Chris Murphy of     Connecticut —  who replaced Lieberman in 2013 —   last     week.   ’ ’         ’ ’     It’s true that passage of a public plan, at least in the near     future, would be almost impossible. It’s hard enough to pass     anything, and especially hard to pass something on which even     the faintest traces of socialism can be detected.   ’ ’     But even a strong push for a public option can be useful. If     fixing the Affordable Care Act reaches the congressional docket     with some urgency, it can serve as a central piece of     Democrats’ opening offer that eventually gives way to other     compromise solutions. Republicans en masse won’t abandon their     desire to eliminate the act. But with a new Democratic     president beginning a term, it might be possible to peel off     some Republican members of Congress who recognize that the law     isn’t going anywhere, so why not improve on it in the meantime     for their rural constituents? That may come in the form of     increased exchange subsidies for families, doubled subsidies     for community health centers, or a reauthorization of the     reinsurance program.   ’ ’     For Republicans, the health care wars never paused. Whether     Democrats like it or not, and for all the good the Affordable     Care Act has done for the sizable majority of its enrollees,     Obamacare’s holes are being exposed, and Republicans are more     than ready to fill them with the narrative that the law is     beyond repair. If Democrats don’t rally around any ideas for a     fix out of a craven wish not to summon the ghosts of 2010, the     GOP will have succeeded in weaponizing its opponents’ political     fear against their greatest accomplishment.   ’
