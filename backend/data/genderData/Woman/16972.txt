Friday on CNBC, when Democratic presidential front runner Hillary Clinton was asked if she could get prosecuted as a result of the FBI investigation into her handling of classified material during her tenure as secretary of state, she laughed as she said, “No, not at all. This is the same security review that has been going on since last spring. ”  Partial transcript as follows: HARWOOD: “Let me ask about quickly about email. Your Republican opponents have begun to suggest you could be prosecuted or go to jail as a result of this issue. When the average person out there hears there’s an FBI investigation and some guy who worked for her has gotten immunity from prosecution, shouldn’t they be tempted to conclude maybe she could get prosecuted? CLINTON: [laughs] “No, not at all. This is the same security review that has been going on since last spring. I’m happy that everybody now has been cooperating and giving information because I think that will finally end this and show that only appropriate steps were taken. I know the Republicans are engaging in a lot of wishful thinking, but this is not something anyone should be worried about. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
