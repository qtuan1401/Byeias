CNN Political Contributor Michael Nutter cautioned, “[L]et us not slip into some gender bias” by describing Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as “angry” during CNN’s coverage of the Iowa caucuses.  After CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said that in their   speeches, “Hillary was so angry compared to [Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie] Sanders. ” Nutter objected, “[L]et us not slip into some gender bias here. A man raises his voice, he’s enthusiastic. A woman raises her voice, she’s angry. Let’s be very careful about how we characterize some of these things. ” (  NewsBusters) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
