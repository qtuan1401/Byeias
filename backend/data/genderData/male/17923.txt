(THE UNITED WEST) Tom Trento, executive producer of the new movie “Fallen Angel  —   The   of the   of SEAL Team Six” which investigates the deaths of 30 U. S. special forces units in Afghanistan (the largest single day loss of life of SEALs in U. S. History) interviews retired U. S. Navy Admiral James “Ace” Lyons, the former    U. S. Pacific Fleet.  Lyons states the   of SEAL Team SIX was a “dereliction of duty” and further states that the   restrictive rules of engagement also directly led to the deaths of 30 of our nations finest warriors.

Navy Judge Advocate General officer and author of “Call Sign Extortion 17  —   the   of SEAL Team Six“ states that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, dereliction of duty in wartime situations is an extremely serious charge and is punishable by death. Lyon’s joins other top military officers such as former Delta Force commander retired U. S. Army Lt. Gen. William G. “Jerry” Boykin, former head of NORAD Alaska retired U. S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, U. S. Army Major Gen. Paul E. Vallely, former Rep. Allen West ( ) and many other top military analyst who believe that the deaths of 15 members of SEAL Team Six on August 6, 2011 in Afghanistan is a massive     that is far bigger than Benghazi.
