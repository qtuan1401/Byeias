’  ’ ’   Dana T. had never felt more excited about her life. ’ ’   In April, she’d landed what she calls her “dream job,” working in   sales at a global travel company. Like every other employee, she   would need to attend training at the company’s headquarters in   Cologne, Germany. ’ ’   So on May 7 she arrived at the Newark, New Jersey, airport for   her   international flight. “I felt like the luckiest   person in the world,” she told me. ’ ’     When she found her seat on United Airlines Flight 960 to     Frankfurt, Germany, she immediately took note of the man beside     her, in the middle seat. “He was shaking his legs,” she says,     “I thought from nervousness. ” She hoped her neighbor’s     restlessness wouldn’t keep her awake. “I thought, ‘I don’t want     to be jetlagged.’ I’d heard about that but never experienced     it. ” She drank two glasses of red wine with her meal and put on     the longest movie she could find, The Revenant, to     help herself drift off.   ’ ’     The next thing Dana remembers is groggily registering the man     next to her, who had covered his lap with a blanket. He was     gesturing toward his crotch and saying, “Lay on my lap. ” “Since     I was half asleep and clearly did not want to be disturbed, I     just gave him a weird look and said, ‘Um no,’ ” Dana wrote in     an email to me. (I am withholding her full last name to protect     her privacy.) “I just thought the guy was weird. ”   ’ ’     Later, the man woke her again; she glared at him and he seemed     to back off. At this point, Dana recalls, the plane was     somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean, the cabin lights were off,     and everyone around them seemed to be asleep. She wasn’t sure     of the hour, but she was exhausted and quickly drifted off     again.   ’ ’     Then Dana jolted awake to a sharp pain. The man had her left     breast in his hand and was pinching her nipple over her shirt.     When she bolted up, she says, he gasped, “Oh sorry! Sorry!” She     jumped from her seat and sprinted down the darkened aisle.   ’ ’       “I think this man is touching me,” Dana says she told the       first cluster of flight attendants she found: two men, one of       whom was a German from United’s partner carrier Lufthansa,       and one woman. The female attendant responded, “You       think he is?” “No, no, he is, he is,” Dana said. But       in her mind, Dana wondered, Why are you asking me like       that? ’ ’       Dana says the female flight attendant told her to sit back       down, but she refused; she also advised the crew to move the       young woman on the other side of the perpetrator to another       seat —  she looked to Dana like she might be in her late teens.     ’ ’       The German flight attendant disappeared down the aisle and       reappeared a few minutes later to announce he had “yelled at       him. ” Dana says the flight attendant told her that the man       had at first pretended to be asleep and then begged, “Please       don’t arrest me. It was an accident. ” “When I heard about       what the guy said, my heart just dropped,” Dana says. She       thought, “That really was happening   …     This guy just admitted       it. ” That’s when she started to cry, she says.     ’ ’  ’ ’         The crew found Dana a new seat in business class, where she         sat shaking while people snored around her. She says she         told her story to every flight attendant who walked by, and         they responded by “throwing things at me —  free stuff, trying         to make me happy. I feel like they were like, ‘Oh, what an         asshole! Would you like more wine?’ ”       ’ ’         One German flight attendant stopped by to explain that         “people, they move around in their sleep sometimes” and         that “Indian men do this all the time. ” (The alleged         assailant appeared to be of South Asian descent.) After         Dana had calmed down, she says she walked to the front of         the first class section to ask members of the flight crew         what they planned to do about the man. According to her,         “They just stared straight ahead and ignored me. ”       ’ ’         There was one American flight attendant who seemed         sympathetic, Dana says. She told Dana that the crew had put         “a note on [the man’s] profile. ” (None of the airline         industry sources I spoke to for this story had heard of         airlines taking notes on passengers or could tell me what         such a “profile” might be.)       ’ ’         This attendant also snuck down the aisle to snap a photo of         the man on her cellphone. “She seemed to care, so I asked         her, ‘What would you do?’ ” Dana says. The woman told her         to report the incident to the Lufthansa agent at the gate         when the flight landed.       ’ ’         But when the doors opened, Dana had the feeling something         was wrong. “I stood there and watched as they let everyone         off the plane,” she wrote to me. “They let the man off the         plane. ” When she reached the Lufthansa agent, he “was         furious to hear from me and asked me why it wasn’t reported         before the plane landed, to which I replied, ‘It was.’ ”         But apparently the crew had not radioed the information to         the ground.       ’ ’         Dana says the agent told her that, because the police had         not been called to meet the plane, and the man and any         potential witnesses had already left, there was probably         nothing to be done. Over the coming hours, days, and weeks,         she would hear the same thing from airport security in         Frankfurt; the German police in Cologne; and, when she         returned home, the FBI in New Jersey.       ’ ’         Dana’s last glimpse of her flight’s crew was of the         sympathetic American attendant. “When I was sitting there         talking to the cops in the ground control   …     she ran over to         them and knocked on the window and said, ‘I have a         picture,’ as if she thought this was going to help my         case. ” Dana says. “She really wanted to help, I think. But         she unfortunately was not trained on how. ”       ’ ’           How often do fliers —  especially women traveling alone —  have           experiences like Dana’s on airplanes? And how do flight           crews and airlines respond? These questions are           surprisingly difficult to answer, but I spent two months           trying, sending out requests for information that bounced           between three different federal agencies and countless           airport representatives.         ’ ’           First, the numbers. An FBI spokeswoman told me that the           agency had 40 open cases involving sexual assaults on           aircraft in 2015 and 37 cases so far this year. But the           FBI doesn’t currently track sexual assaults on planes in           its  its official,           nationwide effort to collect crime data from all levels           of law enforcement.         ’ ’  ’ ’           Thus it’s impossible to say how many reports made to           airport security officers and local police departments           aren’t reaching the FBI’s stats. After it was revealed           that at least four sexual assaults had occurred on           aircraft headed for    Reagan National           and Dulles airports in 2014, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes           Norton  that would have compelled the Federal           Aviation Administration to keep statistics on the           problem. At this point, as NBC has  “no federal           agency is maintaining data” on this particular crime.         ’ ’           There’s also the reality that most sexual assault victims           don’t report, so even if the government tried to keep           figures, it would be nearly impossible to get an accurate           count. None of the U. S. airlines contacted for this           story —  United, American, JetBlue, Southwest, Delta,           Frontier, Spirit, and Alaska —  would share data about           sexual assaults on their planes. United also declined to           comment on Dana’s case. Lufthansa confirmed that Dana had           reported an incident to United but could not comment           further on her case.         ’ ’           The stories that have made it to the press, however,           suggest that planes are more treacherous places for           female travelers than most people realize. A casual           search yields : In           2014, a Catholic priest was accused of touching a woman’s           “breast, inner thigh, and groin” on an overnight flight           from Philadelphia to Los Angeles; he later told           authorities that .         ’ ’           A Hawaiian man who  in an airplane lavatory en route to Japan was           stopped only when other passengers ripped the bathroom           door off its hinges. In 2015, a New Jersey woman flying           from Dubai to JFK popped a Xanax to help her sleep and           woke to find that “her vaginal area was sore” and “that           her underwear had been shifted and that lotion was in her           vaginal area and on her underwear,” . The Staten Island man seated next to her           had stolen a bottle of Nivea lotion from her bag and           .         ’ ’             This June, the Washington Post  the story             of a    girl who said she was sexually             assaulted while flying alone from Dallas to Portland,             Oregon. Her lawyer, Brent Goodfellow, told me that             after the case made headlines, calls and emails from             other women who’d been assaulted on planes poured into             his office. When I asked how many he’d received, he             thought for a minute. “Fifty,” he estimated.           ’ ’             These incidents tend to follow a pattern, says Dana             LaRue Park, a blogger who told me she’s heard from at             least 10 victims since 2011, when she  on a flight from Los Angeles to             Chicago. Like her, the people who’ve contacted her were             all “women traveling alone, on overnight flights. ”             Usually they’d taken some sort of sleep aid; often             they’d covered themselves with blankets that concealed             the assailant’s roving hands, or the assailant had             covered them for that purpose, as LaRue Park says her             assailant did with his jacket. Middle or window seats             can make a victim “feel trapped”; LaRue Park, for             example, says she didn’t report to the flight crew             while the plane was in the air because she would have             had to push past the man to reach the aisle.           ’ ’             Of course, the things that make female fliers             targets —  taking a  ; sleeping on said   like             everyone else —  are basic elements of travel that             shouldn’t be   to half the population.             Airlines, however, have few policies in place that             suggest they feel responsible for managing the risks             particular to women.           ’ ’  ’ ’             “I don’t believe this is being addressed, and I don’t             believe it’s being addressed across the aviation             industry,” Sara Nelson, president of the Association of             Flight Attendants, told me. “We have general protocols             for assault on the airplane,” she says, but “the             training and protocols are lacking” when it comes to             sexual assault in particular.           ’ ’    ’ ’               For the authorities to have met Dana’s plane and               arrested her alleged assailant, the flight crew would               have had to go to the pilots —  the only people with the               authority to radio the ground —  who would in turn have               had to decide that the incident merited a report. In               extreme situations, if passengers or crew are in               immediate danger, pilots can divert their flight,               radioing down to the nearest airport for permission               to land. But communication between cabin crew and               captain isn’t always crystal clear, according to               Poole. “The captain makes the call,” Poole says, and               “there’s a big divider between us and them. ”             ’ ’               Local law enforcement is an additional variable,               especially if the plane is landing in a country,                where authorities               take a notoriously blasé stance on sexual assault.               According to Dana, when she went to the police               station in Cologne, “They said, ‘What happened to you               here is considered just rude. Just let it go.’ ”             ’ ’               When she got home, Dana went to the FBI. A               spokeswoman for the violent crimes unit within the               FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, which handles               sexual assaults on planes, told me that the FBI and               foreign law enforcement will usually collaborate on               investigations, but the bureau generally maintains               jurisdiction over crimes that occur on U. S. airlines.               (The FBI also has jurisdiction over crimes that occur               in U. S. airspace.)             ’ ’               Dana told me that the FBI investigators she’s spoken               to, though they’ve been kind, have seemed intent on               preparing her for disappointment. (It is against the               FBI’s policy to comment on or confirm the existence               of any specific investigation.) If the FBI isn’t               there to meet the plane when it lands, investigators               face setbacks that can “hinder the collection of               evidence and statements,” as the FBI spokeswoman               wrote to me. Even though the bureau can generally               subpoena the name of the alleged perpetrator from the               airline, possible witnesses have dispersed, and the               victim’s own memory may no longer be as clear.             ’ ’               LaRue Park has observed “some form of urgency that               happens if it’s reported in the moment. ” She would               advise victims to “create the biggest scene possible               in the middle of the act, so someone will look and               you’ll have witnesses. ” But, she says, “It just seems               that cases, even without a witness, are taken a lot               more seriously” if the crew calls from the air.             ’ ’  ’ ’                 In the fundamental decision of whether to call                 down, as in all aspects of their response to sexual                 assault onboard, crews appear to be given little                 guidance —  from the airlines or from the federal                 government. When I first contacted the FAA,                 spokesman Jim Peters referred me to the                 Transportation Security Administration.               ’ ’                 The TSA informed me that it deals with                 “counterterrorism, not law enforcement issues                 aboard aircraft,” and sent me back to the FAA. This                 time, Peters emailed me the pertinent section of                 the Federal Aviation Regulations —  Part                 121. 421. ii —  which stipulates simply that flight                 attendants must be trained in “Passenger handling,                 including the procedures to be followed in the case                 of deranged persons or other persons whose conduct                 might jeopardize safety. ”               ’ ’                 “Each carrier decides how to implement the                 regulation, the FAA does not tell them how to do                 that,” Peters wrote, adding: “Generally, flight                 crews have wide discretion about whether to call                 law enforcement to meet an aircraft and the FAA                 does not have a requirement for flight crews to                 notify authorities when a passenger alleges a                 sexual assault during flight. ”               ’ ’                 Most of the airlines I contacted were not                 enormously forthcoming about their approaches to                 implementing FAA regulation 121. 421. ii. A spokesman                 for American Airlines wrote to me in an email, “In                 all cases of misconduct between two passengers, we                 will immediately separate them, and request law                 enforcement meet the aircraft.   …     Out of an                 abundance of caution, our employees are trained to                 report any activity that is out of the ordinary to                 law enforcement. ”               ’ ’                 A spokeswoman for Southwest wrote that “our Crews                 are trained on   tactics for various                 types of assaults. Depending on the situation, our                 protocols do include separating individuals and                 providing the proper notifications. ” After I                 emailed United to ask what training crews received                 about sexual assault and what protocols for                 response the airline had in place, a spokesman                 referred me to the TSA. JetBlue, Delta, Spirit,                 Frontier, and Alaska failed to respond to requests                 for comment about crew training and                   protocols around sexual assault.               ’ ’                 In practice, it appears that crews’ responses vary                 widely. Goodfellow, the lawyer for the                    victim, connected me with an adult victim whose                 case he’s also representing. I’ll call his client                 Lorrie to protect her privacy; she’s still afraid                 of her alleged assailant. Lorrie was flying from                 London to Dallas on American Airlines in September                 when she was, she says, “stalked and harassed                 repeatedly by a deranged individual. ”               ’ ’                 She noticed from the moment the man sat down next                 to her that he was “mumbling to himself and kind of                 clenching his fists angrily,” she says, and shortly                 after takeoff, he began leaning his body weight                 into her, pinning her against the window, and                 “would place his face less than an inch from mine                 and stare, and he had his hand on his crotch,” she                 says. Lorrie managed to push past him and tell the                 head flight attendant, who moved the man to another                 seat. But minutes later, Lorrie says, he walked                 back up the aisle and stood over her, “clenching                 his fists and hitting the [tray] table” while she                 sobbed in panic.               ’ ’                 From here, Lorrie alleges that the American crew                 grossly mishandled the situation. For the rest of                 the roughly   flight, they kept moving the                 man, she says, and the man kept coming back. After                 his third reappearance, the crew threatened to                 restrain him with handcuffs —  but they never actually                 did so, she says, and it wasn’t clear to Lorrie                 that they knew how.               ’ ’                 After what Lorrie believes was the man’s eighth                 return, the head flight attendant came and sat with                 her; the next two or three times, he was there “to                 meet him and escort him back. ” After that, one of                 the two pilots took the flight attendant’s place                 guarding Lorrie; about an hour later, he and the                 other pilot swapped. “I couldn’t believe they                 brought a pilot out,” Lorrie says. “That seemed                 like one of the biggest safety risks. ”               ’ ’                 From the pilots, Lorrie learned that the crew had                 strongly considered diverting the plane. “I learned                 about all the activity between them and the other                 countries, all the places where they had clearance                 to land,” she told me. “They even said they should                 have [diverted]. They said it was very expensive                 and everyone on the flight would have been                 extremely inconvenienced. ”               ’ ’  ’ ’                 American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein told me                 that it is “up to the discretion of the pilot of an                 aircraft whether they would divert or not,” adding                 that many factors have to align to make a diversion                 possible. If the plane is “over weight” —  heavy with                 fuel that would have burned off over the course of                 a longer voyage —  the pilot may need to circle for                 hours before it’s light enough to safely land, he                 said. What’s more, in an international diversion,                 the new destination must have customs officers                 available to process the passengers.               ’ ’                 Though Lorrie says the police escorted the man off                 on landing, they decided, for reasons unclear to                 her, that they didn’t have enough information to                 hold him. American confirmed that authorities met                 Lorrie’s plane but otherwise declined to comment on                 her case. She told me she continues to live in fear                 of running into the man in Dallas, her home. She                 doesn’t know his name.               ’ ’ anywhere from a few thousand                   dollars to more than $100, 000 —  but some crews                   decide the price is worth paying, especially when                   an assailant doesn’t seem easily cowed. An Alaska                   Airlines flight from Portland to Anchorage                    in June after a    man                   drunkenly groped the    girl seated next                   to him, continuing after she pushed him away and                   forcing his tongue into her mouth. Even when                   crews make the calculation to stay on course,                   they can do more than simply radio the ground and                   separate accuser and accused.                 ’ ’                   “Our job is to keep the situation from                   escalating,” Poole, the flight attendant, wrote                   to me in an email. “We aren’t going to run                   up and down the aisle yelling ‘molester.’ ” But                   crews need to balance the importance of                   maintaining calm onboard against the need to                   gather information and, of course, to keep the                   assailant under control. Though Poole has never                   dealt with the sexual assault of a passenger, she                   told me she would discreetly look for witnesses.                   If the flight was full, she would also have to                   ask herself: “Who can I seat next to the                   assaulter? Who can handle it?”                 ’ ’                     It appears that the crews on Dana’s and                     Lorrie’s flights never informed the other                     passengers of the incident or asked them if                     they’d seen anything. Both women told me that                     the crews left the lights off and the seatbelt                     signs dimmed as if everything was routine. But                     some crews make different choices. The                      on the Catholic priest who assaulted a woman en                     route to Los Angeles noted that the crew                     “reseated [him] in the front of the plane in a                     seat between two male passengers” —  presumably so                     that both the flight attendants and his new                     seatmates could keep an eye on him.                   ’ ’                     After the    was allegedly assaulted                     on her way to Portland, her lawyer says, the                     crew identified a passenger who said he’d seen                     the man seated next to her drinking heavily in                     an airport bar; they moved the possible witness                     to the front of the plane along with the girl.                     They also turned on the   sign                     for the duration of the flight, possibly, the                     lawyer thinks, to preserve any evidence for the                     authorities.                   ’ ’                     A person who gets punched in the face on an                     airplane can expect that the flight attendants                     have been trained to respond, according to the                     AFA’s Nelson —  but, at least for the moment, a                     victim of sexual assault simply can’t predict                     how the crew will react. “We’d like to see                     standard reporting procedures across the                     industry,” Nelson told me. “I think in most                     cases and with most airlines, the authorities                     are meeting the airplane.                   ’ ’  ’ ’                     But when you don’t have consistent procedures,                     it’s possible those things aren’t happening. ”                     She’d like to see the government and the                     airlines set rules to cover the basic questions                     that crews inevitably have in the moment: “Are                     you trading seats? Are you getting a passenger                     to volunteer to sit next to the person who’s                     been a problem? Are you detaining them?”                   ’ ’                     As long as crews have to decide those things in                     the air, and with insufficient training to                     guide them, some will get it wrong. That has                     left Dana, for one, feeling nervous about the                     fact that she’ll have to fly to her company’s                     headquarters in Germany again. The FBI is still                     investigating her case, but what she really                     wants to know, she says, is: “Basically, is it                     safe to fly with United?” She commented about                     her experience on the airline’s Facebook page                     and immediately got a message from its                     communications team, but the corporate senior                     manager to whom she was referred has told her                     “that it is being handled by the FBI and there                     is nothing else that can be done,” she says.                   ’ ’                     At this point, after months of calls to the                     airline and the FBI, and of telling her “story                     story story, over and over again,” she says,                     close friends are advising her to let go and                     move on for sanity’s sake. “The more I try to                     do something about it, the worse it gets for                     me,” she says. She’s been struggling with                     anxiety. “I felt like they were basically                     saying, ‘What do you want us to do? Your body                     is going to be touched. Your body is not your                     own,’ ” she says. “I went through my whole life                     thinking if something ever happened to me, of                     course there would be recourse. Now that I                     realize there isn’t, it’s a scarier world. ”                   ’ ’                     Planes give many people an odd sense of safety:                     Far above our planet’s atmosphere and its                     everyday norms, it feels ordinary to sleep                     squeezed between total strangers. Dana will                     probably never experience air travel that way                     again. She remembers the sympathetic flight                     attendant saying to her, “Don’t worry, honey,                     we have him on a plane. He can’t go anywhere. ”                     For a few hours, that was true. “But they let                     him go. ”                   ’
