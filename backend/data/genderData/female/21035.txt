Jennifer Lopez released the music video for her new single “Ain’t Your Mama” on Friday, which finds the pop star playing the roles of several oppressed women  —   among them a 1950s housewife, a 1960s secretary and a   1980s executive  —   while telling the men in her life that she won’t cook for them or do their laundry anymore.[  The video for the singer’s new feminist anthem begins with a   J. Lo preparing to deliver an evening newscast as a 1995 quote from Hillary Clinton plays in the background: “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all. ” “Look, I don’t have to tell you things are bad,” Lopez kicks off the video. “Taken for granted, ignored,     we have a big problem, ladies. ” The Dr.   track kicks in and J. Lo is a 1950s housewife, who’s fed up with her unappreciative husband. Then she’s a 1960’s typist who puts her boss’ tie through a typewriter and throws a drink in his face. After that, she’s an   worker, and then a 1980s business executive who kicks papers around and dances on work desks when she’s apparently shut out of a meeting because she is a woman. The video ends with a   Lopez dancing in the streets with other women while triumphantly telling the men in their lives that they “ain’t your mama. ” The song was written by Meghan Trainor (“Dear Future Husband,” “All About That Bass”) and Jacob Kasher.
