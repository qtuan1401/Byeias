Snoop Dogg launched a   tirade against the Academy Awards this week, saying he won’t be tuning into the “bulls —  t” awards show this year. [The rapper became the latest celebrity to boycott this year’s Oscars, after director Spike Lee and actress Jada Pinkett Smith made a similar pledge on Monday. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore joined in the boycott on Tuesday. The backlash came after the Academy nominated exclusively white actors in top acting categories for a second straight year.  (Warning: Explicit Language) “Somebody asked me, was I gonna watch the motherf —  ing Oscars f —   no,” Snoop said in a video obtained by TMZ. “What the f —   am I gonna watch that bulls —  t for. They ain’t got no n —  as nominated. All these great movies and all this great sh —  t you keep stealing from us  …     F —   you! F —   you!” Of course, Snoop’s never been nominated for an Academy Award, though he did win an MTV Movie Award for Best Cameo in 2002 for his small role in Training Day. The rapper also earned a nomination for Best   Performance in a Film or Video at the 2004 AVN Awards, for his role in Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp. Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs responded to the controversy late Monday, saying in a statement that she was “heartbroken” and “frustrated” over the lack of diversity in the acting categories and vowing “big changes” for next year’s show.
