Italian studio Pininfarina designed the twentieth century’s greatest Ferraris and through their work with the Prancing Horse    plus the likes of Fiat, Lancia, and Alfa Romeo    helped define the emotive Italian style of the   sportscar.  On the company’s 85th birthday, Paulo Pininfarina, the fourth patriarch of the family to head up the company since its founding by Battista ”Pinin” Farina in 1930, looks through the almost 1000 automobiles sculpted by Pininfarina to bring us its 10 most striking creations. ”The 10 icons I selected. .. are not necessarily the best, the ’top 10,’ says chairman Pininfarina, ”they are to me probably the most emotionally involving.” The Pininfarina Book has been published to mark the design house’s 85th anniversary.
