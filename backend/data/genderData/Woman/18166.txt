President Barack Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton Thursday in a web video. [“I want those of you who have been with me from the beginning of this incredible journey to be the first to know that I’m with her,” Obama said in a web video released by the Clinton campaign.  Obama recalled his own   primary campaign against Clinton and congratulated her for making history. “I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there to campaign for Hillary,” he said. The video was released shortly after Bernie Sanders met with Obama at the White House. “Look, I know how hard this job can be. That’s why I know Hillary will be so good at it,” Obama said. “In fact, I don’t think there’s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office. ” Obama acknowledged that both Sanders and Clinton were both “patriots who love this country” “They share a vision for the America that we all believe in, an America that is hopeful, an America that is   an America that is strong and fair and gives every child the same chance as we had,” he said. “Those are the values that unite us as Democrats. Those are the values that make America great. Those are the values that are going to be tested in this election. ” According to the Clinton campaign, Obama will travel to Green Bay, Wisconsin, next Wednesday to campaign with Hillary Clinton. After the video was released, former President Bill Clinton tweeted a response. Thank you, @BarackObama! https:  .   —   Bill Clinton (@billclinton) June 9, 2016,
