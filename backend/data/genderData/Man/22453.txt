Josh Hilling’s body camera captured the confrontation he had with a   murder suspect who was begging police to kill him. [According to Cincinnati. com, Hilling, an officer in Glendale, Ohio, was on patrol when he saw Javier Pablo Aleman, 46, bobbing in and out of traffic on Interstate 75.  Police investigators said Hilling did not know Aleman was a murder suspect when he offered the man a ride in his patrol car. Before Hilling started to search the suspect, Aleman allegedly pulled out a knife and began screaming, “Kill me” at the officer. Aleman reportedly charged at Officer Hilling, who shot him in the stomach with a single shot.  A bleeding and badly wounded Aleman allegedly continued to thrust at Officer Hilling with his knife. The suspect shouted at Hillman and other officers dozens of times, “Kill me. ” “Sir, please, just get down. Sir, please, drop the knife. Let us help you,” Hilling said to the man. It took a taser to bring down the suspect, who was eventually handcuffed and taken into custody. “I’m not going to speak for the chief or the sheriff, but Joshua Hilling deserves a medal for what he did,” Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters told reporters. Investigators think the knife Aleman was allegedly waving may be the murder weapon used in a fatal stabbing in Maryland. “Officer Joshua Hilling is one brave individual,” Deters said.
