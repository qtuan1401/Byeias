’  ’ ’   Deutsche Bank shares are crashing after  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’     Deutsche Bank AG (XETRA: DBKGn. DE   NYSE: DB) confirms that it     has commenced negotiations with the Department of Justice in     the United States (“DoJ”) with a view to seeking to settle     civil claims that the DoJ may consider in connection with the     bank’s issuance and underwriting of residential       securities (RMBS) and related securitization activities between     2005 and 2007.   ’ ’     The bank confirms market speculation of an opening position by     the DoJ of USD 14 billion and that the DoJ has invited the bank     as the next step to submit a counter proposal.      Deutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil     claims anywhere near the number cited. The negotiations are     only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an     outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at     materially lower amounts.   ’
