”Uber’s very bad year is continuing as  starting at the top, comes to light.” ”A new video  shows Uber’s CEO fighting with an Uber driver over falling fares in February.” ’In the video  —   recorded by the driver, Fawzi Kamel  —   CEO Travis Kalanick sits in the back between two women on Super Bowl Sunday. ’ ’”I make sure every year is a hard year,” Kalanick said in the video. ”That’’s kind of how I roll. I make sure every year is a hard year. If it’’s easy, I’’m not pushing hard enough. ”’ ”That competitive spirit becomes even more apparent as the video progresses. As Kalanick is prepared to exit, Kamel brings up the Uber Black business and accuses Kalanick of lowering fares again. Kamel says he’s been driving since 2011 and the rates have dropped from $20 to just $2. 75 a mile. (Kamel’s $20 claim couldn’t be verified. In 2012, the rate was at $4. 90 per mile. It’s currently $3. 75 a mile for Uber black drivers. )” ’”  ” Kalanick replied. ’ ’Kalanick tried to explain that Uber launched cheaper models due to increased competition. The driver then told Kalanick that the company had cost him $90, 000, and now he was bankrupt.’ ”That’s when Kalanick lost his temper:” ’”You know what? Some people don’’t like to take responsibility for their own    . They blame everything in their life on somebody else.’ ’”Good luck!” Kalanick said before leaving the car.’ ’Uber did not immediately respond to request for comment on the video.’ ”Uber’s very bad year is continuing as more. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
