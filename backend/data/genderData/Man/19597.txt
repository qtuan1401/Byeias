Sen. Marco Rubio expresses his faith in God and the value of strong values in a new ad going up in Iowa soon. It is his latest attempt to appeal to evangelical voters in the state. [“I believe you can’t have a strong America without strong families. I believe in the fundamental freedoms that make us great. And I believe in God that God has blessed America,” Rubio says in the ad provided exclusively to Breitbart News.   “I’m Marco Rubio. I approved this message because it’s time for a president who will put their left hand on the Bible and their right hand in the air, and keep their promise to uphold the Constitution,” he says. “It’s been eight years since we have had a president willing to do that. I will. ”
