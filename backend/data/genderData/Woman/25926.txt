A group of citizens, exercising open carry laws with   and other firearms, stood guard outside Alamance County Republican headquarters on Saturday after the building was vandalized on Friday. [Those who stood guard are members of Alamance County Open Carry.  WCNC spoke to one of the citizens standing guard. “We are here to support freedom,” he said. “The people that vandalize these places, they are cowards. But we’re not. We support the Second Amendment and we want everybody to vote. ” The citizen stressed that they support the votes of everyone, not just Republicans.  The open carriers stood beside an American flag and a Gadsden flag, which proclaims the motto, “Don’t Tread on Me. ” Burlington Police responded to calls of vandalism on Friday but have not made any arrests.
