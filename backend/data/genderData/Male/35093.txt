 (CNN) When the ”Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” album greeted the world on June 1, 1967, its cover featured the Beatles in colorful   uniforms before a constellation of 57 (mostly) famous faces.  Asked to put their heroes on the cover, the band selected a mix of artists, writers, movie stars, musicians and others. Most were chosen by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, along with suggestions from artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, the cover’s designers. George Harrison added four Indian gurus. Ringo Starr said he didn’t care. ”It was completely ” said Haworth when asked last month about the selection process. The faces ranged from the iconic (Marilyn Monroe) to the obscure (child singer Bobby Breen) and from the hugely influential (Bob Dylan) to the just plain silly (”Tarzan’s” Johnny Weissmuller).  The album made a seismic cultural splash, and fans listened to it over and over while scouring the cover for clues to the Beatles’ creative genius.  But that was then. If ”Sgt. Pepper” came out now, who might join the Beatles on the cover? We’ve taken a crack at answering this question, with a little help from our friends: three Beatles experts.  First, though, let’s decipher the original. Who was who in 1967, 1. Sri Yukteswar (guru) 2. Aleister Crowley (occultist and author) 3. Mae West (actor) 4. Lenny Bruce (comedian) 5. Karlheinz Stockhausen (composer) 6. W. C. Fields (comedian) 7. Carl Jung (psychiatrist) 8. Edgar Allan Poe (author) 9. Fred Astaire (actor) 10. Richard Merkin (artist) 11. Alberto Vargas   girl 12. Huntz Hall (actor) 13. Simon Rodia (artist) 14. Bob Dylan (musician) 15. Aubrey Beardsley (artist) 16. Sir Robert Peel (British statesman) 17. Aldous Huxley (author) 18. Dylan Thomas (poet) 19.

Sonny Liston (boxer)  . The Beatles (wax figures) 57. Albert Einstein (physicist) 58. Bobby Breen (singer) 59. Marlene Dietrich (actor) 60. Diana Dors (actor) 61. Shirley Temple (actor) How we chose the new faces, Half a century later, some of those original faces feel a little, well, dated. They’re also overwhelmingly white and male.  ”I apologize for that,” said Haworth, who concedes the Beatles didn’t nominate a single woman. ”I should have known better.” So we replaced them with 57 new ones, chosen with input from Glenn Gass, a professor at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music who has been teaching a course on the Beatles for 35 years Gillian Gaar,   of ”Sgt. Pepper at Fifty: The Mood, the Look, the Sound, the Legacy of the Beatles’ Great Masterpiece” and Haworth, now a visual artist living in Salt Lake City. Our criteria: Like the original cover, we focused heavily on artists, musicians and other creative types from the past 50 years. We emphasized people who   pioneers in their field (Steve Jobs) or catalysts for change (Rosa Parks) with a few nods to celebrity and the Beatles’   whimsy (hello, Lisa Simpson! ). We also included some huge 20th century figures  the Beatles omitted (Elvis, duh).  As Gaar said, referring to the 1967 cover, ”People will have their own idea of why these people were chosen and what it all means.” Yes, you will. And you will have your own suggestions, too. Let the arguments begin. Who is who in 2017, 1. Cesar Chavez (labor leader) 2. Aung San Suu Kyi (Burmese politician) 3. The Dalai Lama (Tibetan spiritual leader) 4.
