Washington (CNN) A top staffer for New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte has resigned after he was arrested Friday night under suspicions he was attempting to hire a prostitute. Ayotte, a Republican, said in a statement issued late Saturday that she accepted the resignation of David Wihby, 61, who had served as her state director for a year, according to the Boston Globe. ”I am shocked and deeply saddened that David Wihby, my state director and a friend for many years, has been arrested under these circumstances,” she said in the statement.  ”David obviously cannot continue his duties, and I have accepted his resignation. This is a very difficult time, and my thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved.” According to the Globe, Wihby was arrested Friday on a misdemeanor charge of soliciting a prostitute. He’s also a member of the Manchester, N. H. school board and has served in various local elected offices in New Hampshire. Ayotte is up for reelection this cycle, and is one of Democrats’ top targets heading into 2016.
