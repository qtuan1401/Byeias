’Every driver knows that no matter what type of car you drive, winter is : less fuel efficiency, lower tire pressure, and frozen windshield wipers and washer solvent, for example.’ ’What you might not know is that   cars suffer far greater in winter time  —   in terms of fuel efficiency  —   compared to gasoline and diesel guzzlers.’ ’But there is a way to lengthen the life of your battery during these frigid times.’ ”Let’s first compare the numbers:” ”Part of the reason for these nasty numbers is because batteries simply don’t run as efficiently in the cold. But another big problem could be the way you’re warming the car’s cabin. Cabin heaters zap large amounts of energy from the batteries.” ’”EVs are not able to scavenge waste heat for cabin heating the way a conventional vehicle can with an   engine,” Henning   manager for   research at Argonne National Laboratory’’s Center for Transportation Research, told Business Insider.’ ”Thankfully, there’s a better way. You can avoid draining your batteries in the cold and extend the car’s range by plugging it in before you drive it. That way, you’re taking energy directly from the grid, and not your batteries, to warm the cabin.” ’Another perk of this approach is that you can do it remotely, within the comfort of your home or office,   said:’ ”Once you’re on the road, another way to conserve energy and extend range is to use the seat warmers instead of the cabin heater, according to the .” ’Note: If you own a conventional gasoline car, you should try to avoid warming your cabin until after you start driving. Letting the car sit in the driveway while running can have detrimental effects on your engine. Learn more .’
