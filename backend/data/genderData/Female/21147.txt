Sunday on CNN, network chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta was asked by host Wolf Blitzer if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton should seek the counsel of a doctor before she embarks on a trip to California on Monday.  According to Gupta, it would wise for her to see a doctor out of caution, given the day’s incident of her apparent struggle to remain upright that was caught on camera. “I think I would. And this has less to do with the fact she’s Hillary Clinton or a candidate for president, but if you hear of anybody who is having this episode a little that is a little bit unusual, maybe not surprising given again the heat of the day, and the medications, but I think as you say out of an abundance of caution, I’d probably want to make sure that her blood pressure, do a routine EKG, check some basic lab values and that’s not, you know, in medicine you have your strong suspicions, and I think again most common conclusion here is what we’ve been talking about  —   but out of an abundance of caution and interest in thoroughness you might check those other things,” he said.  “If they check out fine they’d have no problem traveling.  If I were Dr. Bardak, who is her doctor or the other doctors caring for her, we should probably get routine tests, given what had happened today. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
