Nancy Pelosi: The Affordable Care Act ”has succeeded in every way” https:  .  #PelosiTownHall https:  .  During a town hall on CNN on Tuesday, House Minority Leader Representative Nancy Pelosi ( ) argued that Obamacare “has succeeded in every way. ”  Pelosi said the law had three purposes: “to increase coverage  —   to expand those who got healthcare, to improve benefits, and to lower costs. And it has succeeded in every way. ” She added that “Some of the costs are still going up because of the costs of prescription drugs,” but they’re increasing at a slower rate than at any time that this has been measured.
