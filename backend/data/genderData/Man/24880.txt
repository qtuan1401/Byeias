The New York Times calls for the Clinton family to do more to distance themselves from the Clinton Foundation, calling it an “ethical imperative” as she continues to run for president. [In an editorial in Tuesday’s newspaper, the Times calls for Clinton to ban donations to the foundation from foreign and corporate entities immediately, but says that closing the foundation altogether is “unwarranted. ”  “The foundation could do much more to distance itself from the foreign and corporate money that risks tainting Mrs. Clinton’s campaign,” the editorial reads. “Its plans to restrict its funding sources only after the election will likely dog Mrs. Clinton. ” The editorial warns that questions about the foundation will continue, despite the family’s efforts to defend it. “If Mrs. Clinton wins, it could prove a target for her political adversaries,” the Times concludes. “Achieving true distance from the foundation is not only necessary to ensure its effectiveness, it is an ethical imperative for Mrs. Clinton. ”
