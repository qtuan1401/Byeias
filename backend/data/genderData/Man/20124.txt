U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers working at the Port of Nogales, Arizona, seized nearly $2 million in drugs this week. [The drugs were discovered by CBP officers in multiple attempted smuggling incidents this week. The drugs seized include marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin, according to a statement obtained from the CBP by Breitbart Texas.  Officers stopped a Mexican female driving a Chevrolet SUV through the DeConcini crossing from Mexico on April 22. A   officer alerted officials to the presence of drugs. During a secondary inspection, officers discovered over five pounds of heroin and   pounds of meth. These loads were valued at approximately $91, 000 and $295, 000 respectively. The    Mexican woman was taken into custody and the SUV and drugs were seized. That same day, officers stopped a    American woman from Tucson, Arizona. Again, a   officer detected the presence of narcotics in her Suzuki SUV as she attempted to cross the Mariposa crossing from Mexico. The   officer directed the other officers to the rear quarter panels of the SUV where they discovered 20 pounds of heroin and 15 pounds of meth. Officials stated the value of the heroin was about $341, 000. They said the meth was worth about $45, 000. Authorities placed the female suspect in federal custody and seize the drugs and vehicle.
