[“Staff and their families from throughout the administration will also attend this event for the fireworks viewing and performance by Janelle Monae and Kendrick Lamar,” the press secretary’s office said in a statement.

The president sent a “shoutout” to Lamar for his racially and politically charged performance at the 58th annual Grammy Awards in February, where the rapper, flanked by backup dancers dressed in prison uniforms and chains, performed the song “The Blacker The Berry,” off of Lamar’s   album To Pimp a Butterfly.
