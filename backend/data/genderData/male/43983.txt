’  ’ ’   House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Monday that he was ”encouraged”   by the  the GOP’’s bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care   Act. ’ ”   In an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, Ryan sought to   downplay that . ” ’   The Wisconsin Republican said the estimates were better than he   expected. ’ ’   ”If you read this entire report, I’’m pretty encouraged by it, and   it actually exceeded my expectations,” Ryan said. ’ ”   The House speaker also immediately cast doubt on the estimates   for the number of uninsured.
