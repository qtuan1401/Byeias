Federal investigators found three bombs with shrapnel after investigating a Saturday morning bombing in a New Jersey beach town that they are treating as suspected terrorism. [The bomb went off in a trash can timed to go off at the same time the Seaside Semper Five Marine Corps Charity 5K was set to occur.  No one was injured in the explosion, but the race has been canceled out of an abundance of caution, and a   radius around the area was closed off, according to the Asbury Park Press. Authorities found two undetonated shrapnel devices connected to the exploded bomb, but it appears it “didn’t do the damage it was supposed to,” Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office said. The explosion occurred around 9:30 a. m. as spectators and runners were about to line up for the start of the race, according to New Jersey 101. 5. The FBI and the U. S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms  Explosives is leading the investigation into the bomb with assistance from New Jersey State Police and local and county authorities. Gov. Chris Christie has been briefed on the incident, and the New York City Police Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau is monitoring developments. “We are grateful that nobody was injured, but this is a serious act of violence against the people of New Jersey,” Attorney General Christopher Porrino told New Jersey 101. 5 Saturday afternoon. “We will not rest until we find the person or persons responsible. ” No suspects have been found, authorities say.
