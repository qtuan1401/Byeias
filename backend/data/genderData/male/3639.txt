RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Elaine Thompson of Jamaica won the 200 meters to complete a sprint double at the Rio Games. Dafne Schippers of the Netherlands won the silver medal. She leaned at the line in a desperate bid to catch Thompson and tumbled hard to the track. Tori Bowie of the United States won the bronze. Thompson’s winning time was 21. 78. In the 100 meters, Thompson had dethroned her countrywoman, the   winner    . Bowie was the silver medalist in that race. Schippers is the reigning world champion in the 200. A former long jumper and heptathlete, she has taken the sprinting world by storm since converting to the dashes full time. Schippers had sealed the favorite’s status with a 21. 96, the fastest time in the semifinals on Tuesday. The race was missing Allyson Felix, who has been a dominant athlete at the distance since as far back as 2004 and who won the gold medal in London in 2012. She was only fourth in the U. S. Trials at 200, though she did qualify for the 400, in which she won the silver medal.
