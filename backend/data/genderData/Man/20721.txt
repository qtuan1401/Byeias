Cinnabon’s tribute tweet to the late Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher backfired Tuesday as the beloved baked goods company found itself on the receiving end of searing social media blowback. [On Tuesday night, the   company posted an apology for a tweet intended to honor Fisher. “Our deleted tweet was genuinely meant as a tribute, but we shouldn’t have posted it. We are truly sorry,” the company tweeted.  Our deleted tweet was genuinely meant as a tribute, but we shouldn’t have posted it. We are truly sorry.  —   Cinnabon (@Cinnabon) December 28, 2016,  The   Twitter message that prompted the chain’s apology read, “RIP Carrie Fisher, you’ll always have the best buns in the galaxy. ” The tweet featured Princess Leia’s face with a Cinnabon roll in place of the Star Wars character’s iconic hair. It wasn’t long before social media users began slamming the company as “tasteless” for using Fisher’s death to promote its product.
