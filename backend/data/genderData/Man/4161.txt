Tim Tebow stepped to the plate Wednesday for his first   as a professional baseball player and took a swing at the first pitch he saw. Naturally, he hit a home run. Tebow is a polarizing figure in the sports world. As a Heisman Trophy winner while at the University of Florida and, briefly, as an N. F. L. quarterback, he attracted both adulation and scorn for his overt Christian faith and his habit of Tebowing, or bowing in prayer after successes. On the field, some saw a quarterback with anemic passing statistics while others saw a player who always seemed to find a way to win. He faced considerable skepticism when, with his football days seemingly over, he announced plans to try for a baseball career at age 29. He had not played the game since high school. Still, scouts from 28 teams attended an open workout, and the Mets saw enough to sign Tebow to a minor league contract and send him to the Florida Instructional League. Game No. 1 came Wednesday against the St. Louis Cardinals’ team in front of about 250 fans in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Tebow batted second and played left field. His first   ended in seconds with the homer to  . The pitcher was John Kilichowski, drafted out of Vanderbilt by the Cardinals in the 11th round in June. He posted a 2. 70 E. R. A. in Class A with the Peoria Chiefs and the State College Spikes this past season, giving up four home runs in 11 games. Tebow’s teammates rushed out to greet him at home plate after the   bash. At that point, his career stats looked like this: batting average 1. 000,   average 1. 000, slugging average 4. 000. And let’s make up a stat. Ratio of pitches seen to home runs delivered: 1:1. Barry Bonds? Babe Ruth? Tim Tebow was surpassing them all, and making the skeptics look pretty foolish. In his second   Tebow grounded into a double play, dropping his batting average to a merely superhuman . 500. Then he was 1 for 3, and 1 for 4, and he finished the day 1 for 6.
