”Kroger is now delivering groceries to customers’ homes using Uber.” ’The grocery chain already has a program called ClickList that lets customers order groceries online and pick them up at a store, where employees will load their food into their cars.’ ”The delivery service is the newest extension of ClickList, and so far it’s available in only two cities: Dallas and Richmond, Virginia.” ’We tried it, and it made us never want to drive to a grocery store again.’ ”Here’s how it worked:” ”ClickList’s store pickup has been a  for its convenience, and the delivery service brings that convenience factor to a whole new level.” ”I was floored by the ease of Kroger’s delivery service. (And no, I was not paid by Kroger to write this review. )” ”Most Kroger stores are huge, and I’ve come to dread the inconvenience of trekking across the entire store, especially when I have only a few items on my grocery list. The delivery service cuts out that trip.” ”I also found that Kroger’s service is superior to other grocery delivery services that I’ve tried. Other services tend to have longer delivery windows, and several times my groceries were left outside my door without my knowledge.” ”With Kroger, it was great to be able to track exactly where my groceries were and when they would arrive. And the Uber driver’s offer to carry them to my kitchen counter made things even easier.” ’However  —   and this could be a big problem for Kroger  —   the price is too steep for me to use the service regularly when I live only a couple of miles from two Kroger stores. If the price were cut in half, I would consider using this service for all my grocery shopping.’ ’Kroger is now delivering groceries to. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
