Cleveland Cavs star Kyrie Irving felt compelled to respond to critics on social media who accused him of throwing a “No Black Girls Allowed” party on a yacht after winning the NBA title.  Irving wrote a Facebook post on Wednesday in which he said, “I’d never think I would have to address something as ridiculous as a yacht party, but I wasn’t raised to discriminate against any race let alone any race of women, especially my own. I was raised by the black women in my family and for me to be connected to some nonsense like a ‘No black girls allowed’ party is embarrassing and an inaccurate portrayal of who and what I represent as man. I wasn’t going to even address any of this because there are literally a million things going on in the world right now that are far more important, rather than people trying to bring question to my character. ” “I would like to apologize to anyone if they were offended initially without knowing any of what actually happened, but that story has no truth to it and I wanted to clear the air on all of this B. S. And for those who know me, I’m sorry you all had to answer questions about a story as ridiculous as something like this,” he continued. “But now, I would like to continue celebrating this championship. Thank you. ”   Kyrie Irving threw a ”no black girls” yacht party, huh?? JR would never.  —   turbo thot.
