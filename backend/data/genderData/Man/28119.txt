A woman in Virginia has developed a bra in which women can conceal a knife or pepper spray for protection while exercising by themselves.[  A man attacked Jennifer Cutrona last April while she ran on a trail near her home. She wore earbuds and did not hear the man approach her. “If I were to be killed senselessly on a trail for somebody’s thrill, how bad it would impact their world? !” she said. She invented and patented the “Booby Trap Bra,” specifically “designed for activity. ” A woman can easily hide a knife or pepper spray in it. “It had to happen for me to move forward,” she continued. “I was excited that I got away, but I know a lot of women aren’t that lucky. ”
