The New York Times reports that the F. B. I. obtained new Hillary Clinton emails after seizing electronic devices from Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin.  The F. B. I. began investigating Weiner after he sent lewd photos to a    girl, after the girl who shared text messages she received from Weiner with the Daily Mail. Weiner suggested that he had been tricked, releasing a statement that did not confirm the charges. “While I have provided the Daily Mail with information showing that I have likely been the subject of a hoax, I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position,” he said. “I am sorry. ” Abedin, a close aide to Hillary Clinton, announced that she would separate from Weiner after the story broke. “After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,” Abedin said on August 29. “Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy. ”
