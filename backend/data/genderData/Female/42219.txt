 (CNN) Rapper Rick Ross was picked up by sheriffs in Fayette County, Georgia, on suspicion of marijuana possession Wednesday afternoon, according to the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office. He was released Wednesday night after posting a $2, 400 bond, county officials said.  Deputies stopped Ross’ Bentley because of a possible a window tint violation and were talking to him when an officer allegedly smelled marijuana coming from the car. Sheriff Barry H. Babb said Ross gave consent to search the vehicle, and a deputy found marijuana. Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, was booked into the Fayette County jail and later posted bond. Ross’ representatives have not responded to a request for comment. The rapper was arrested in June 2014 in North Carolina after failing to appear at a hearing for a previous marijuana charge, according to CNN affiliate  . Ross was taken into custody after performing at the SuperJam Music Festival in Greensboro and later released on a $1, 000 bail.
