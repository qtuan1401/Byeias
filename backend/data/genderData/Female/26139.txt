New York Times bestselling Clinton Cash author and Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer calls the State Department’s Inspector General subpoena of the Clinton Foundation “good news for transparency. ”[“The Clinton Foundation subpoena is good news for transparency, good news for truth, and good news for the American people,” said Schweizer in a statement. “I have said before that while investigating Clinton Cash, I went as far as I could go without subpoena power. When faced with questions about their transparency and honesty, the Clinton Foundation has evaded and stonewalled at every turn. ”  Schweizer, president of the   government investigative research watchdog Government Accountability Institute (GAI) wrote Clinton Cash, the book the New York Times hailed “the most anticipated and feared book of a presidential cycle. ” On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that the State Department Inspector General subpoenaed the Clinton Foundation. Journalists including Fox News’ anchor Bret Baier and National Journal Senior Political Columnist Ron Fournier reacted with surprise that Thursday night’s Democratic Debate moderators Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill chose not to ask Clinton about the Clinton Foundation subpoena. “If I’m moderating, you have to ask,” said Baier. Fournier agreed. “You would ask it again and again and again, as you should. ”
