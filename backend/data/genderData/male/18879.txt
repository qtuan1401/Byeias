  circus and theater entertainment company Cirque du Soleil has canceled its upcoming shows in Greensboro, Charlotte, and Raleigh in North Carolina to protest the state’s Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act. [“Cirque du Soleil strongly believes in diversity and equality for every individual and is opposed to discrimination in any form,” the group announced Friday in a press release. “The new HB2 legislation passed in North Carolina is an important regression to ensuring human rights for all. ”  Cirque du Soleil’s North Carolina cancelation comes as a growing number of artists and entertainers abandon their respective performances in the state to protest of the Public Facilities Privacy  Security Act. The   circus, however, has not canceled its upcoming performances in the United Arab Emirates of Dubai. Indeed, Cirque du Solei has a planned production, Varekai, scheduled to run from September 16 to 24 at the Dubai World Trade Centre. The United Arab Emirates of Dubai has outlawed   marriage, sex or gender reassignment surgery, adoption by   couples, openly gay and lesbian military service, with the aforementioned being punishable by death, fines, or imprisonment. In fact, Cirque du Solei has performed for years in the   United Arab Emirates, including Michael Jackson: The Immortal Tour in 2014, Dralion in 2013, Alegria in 2009, and Quidam in 2006. “Over the past years, Cirque du Soleil has had shows in various countries such as United Arab Emirates,” the Cirque du Solei website proudly states. While calling North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy  Security Act “an important regression to ensuring human rights for all,” it’s unclear if Cirque du Soleil plans to cancel its upcoming shows in nations that put homosexuals to death.
