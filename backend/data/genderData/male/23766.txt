During a campaign speech which recently aired on MSNBC, Chelsea Clinton made clear that her mother, Hillary Clinton, can pursue gun control now that Antonin Scalia is out of the way.  Chelsea was pointing to things that differentiate her mother from Bernie Sanders and the GOP candidates, when she said: It matters to me that my mom also recognizes the role the Supreme Court has when it comes to gun control. With Justice Scalia on the bench one of the few areas where the court actually had an inconsistent record relates to gun control. Sometimes the court upheld local and state gun control measures as being compliant with the Second Amendment and sometimes the court struck them down. Chelsea went on to cite the Michael   Moms Demand Action, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, as groups that stand with Hillary Clinton in believing the court’s next   gun ruling with a “definitive” one.  On February 14 —  the day after Scalia’s death —  Breitbart News warned that his passing reset the Supreme Court’s opportunity to gut the Second Amendment. Chelsea is making clear that her mom does not plan to simply allow that opportunity to fade away. She said voters can count on Hillary Clinton when it comes to “gun control and standing up to the NRA. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
