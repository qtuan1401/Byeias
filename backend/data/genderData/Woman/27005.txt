During the January 17 airing of Face the Nation, Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) explained that he bought a gun on Christmas Eve because he has a Second Amendment right to do so and because it is a way he can defend his family from terrorism. [Host John Dickerson asked Rubio about the firearm purchase. Rubio responded:  First of all I’m not home very often, so that was one of the few days that I was there. Second, I have a right to protect my family. I was previously a firearm holder as well, this was an additional one. And again, I think many Americans around the country feel the same way. Rubio added: I’m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. I have a right to protect my family if someone were to come after us. In fact, if ISIS were to visit us or our communities at any moment, the last line of defense between ISIS and my family is the ability I have to protect my family from them or from a criminal or anyone else who seeks to do us harm.
