Police in Yulee, Florida, are asking the public if anyone has been harassed in stores by a man asking indecent questions and recording them on video. [Police arrested Jeffrey Polizzi after a woman posted a video of her own encounter with the man at the Target store in Yulee. The woman, Candice Spivey, posted her video and story on Facebook.   In her Facebook post, Spivey noted that she recognized the suspect as the same man who approached her at another local store two years ago. Spivey said the man used the same ploy the first time he met her. He began with chit chat about his wife and the clothing she liked to wear, using that topic to springboard into asking what Spivey was wearing “down there. ” “This guy is a huge creep,” Spivey wrote in her Facebook post. “I’m not concerned about charges, I mean I am but I’m more concerned with his face getting out there and him being stopped. ” After the Target shopper confronted the man on her own video, police were called, and they arrested Polizzi for video voyeurism. Police report that the suspect has been charged with the crime in the past. The Nassau County Sheriff’s Office is asking any women whom Polizzi may have approached to contact Detective Kelly at   .
