’  ’ ”   HANOI  —   Hackers attacked the website of a national airline and   flight information screens at Vietnam’s two biggest airports on   Friday, posting notices that state media said criticized the   Philippines and Vietnam and their claims in the South China Sea. ” ”   Operators of airports in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City briefly had   to halt electronic   when systems were attacked on Friday   afternoon, the country’s civil aviation authority said. ” ’   The website of Vietnam Airlines was also compromised, directing   browsers to what the flag carrier described as ”bad websites   overseas.” ’ ’     media said the messages were about the South China Sea   and denounced Vietnam and the Philippines, which are at odds with   Beijing over maritime sovereignty. Vietnamese media said the hack   was claimed by a group called 1937CN. Reuters was not able to   immediately verify the content of the messages. ’ ’   The region is on edge, facing diplomatic dilemmas in the wake of   a July 12 ruling by an arbitral court that declared Chinese   claims to most of the South China Sea as having no legal grounds.   Beijing has called the ruling farcical and refuses to recognize   it. ’ ’’ ’   The decision was favorable to the plaintiff, Manila, and by   extension, Hanoi, which has similar disagreements with China   about its   and the conduct of its vast coastguard   fleet in the South China Sea. ’ ”   Vietnam’s vice transport minister, Nguyen Nhat, said the content   displayed by the hackers offended his nation and the Philippines,   Thanh Nien news reported, without elaborating. ” ’   The report said the same picture was posted on the Vietnam   Airlines website, with ”distorting content” about the situation   in the South China Sea. ’ ’   (Reporting by Mai Nguyen; writing by Martin Petty; editing by   Mark Heinrich) ’
