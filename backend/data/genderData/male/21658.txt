Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough reacted to a New York magazine article by Gabe Sherman suggesting that the hierarchy at Fox News has soured on Sen. Marco Rubio’s ( ) bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.  Scarborough called the report “shocking” given his perception of Fox News’ coverage of Rubio, then went on to liken   Fox News to MSNBC’s 2008 coverage of the contest between  . Barack Obama ( ) and Hillary Clinton ( ) for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. “You’re seeing also New York magazine writing stories about how Fox News has abandoned Marco Rubio, which is shocking because, my God, I’ve never seen a candidate treated better by any network, well, other than MSNBC bowing and scraping to Barack Obama in 2008,” Scarborough said. “But other than that  —   remember that? Every night, like Hillary Clinton would win Kentucky and it would be like, ‘Tonight, racism rises over Lexington.’ I mean, every time Hillary won every time Hillary won, it was like ‘the ghost of Jefferson Davis rises somewhere over a Confederate cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, where Barack Obama was beaten.’ I mean, that was pretty bad, wasn’t it?” When asked about his tone of voice, which was described as “Churchillian” by guest Katty Kay, Scarborough didn’t mention him by name, but used former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann’s patented “sir,” which he would employ often during his MSNBC prime time program. “Sir, I’m not telling you who that was, but, he called George W. Bush a Nazi every day,” Scarborough added. (  Newsbusters) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
