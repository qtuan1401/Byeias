Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin reveals in Vogue today that her Muslim faith helped her deal with her husband Anthony Weiner after news of his perverted online behavior ruined his political career. [“I tried to block out all the noise and move on with my life,” Abedin says, as the piece notes that she cited her Muslim faith to help her as well as a “a really supportive group of friends and colleagues” after the disturbing revelations that went public.  “That support system enabled us —  enabled me —  to get up and to keep doing what I thought were the right things for my family and for myself,” she said. Abedin says she hasn’t seen the Weiner documentary of his doomed mayoral campaign where she played the role of a supporting wife in the midst of the second public meltdown on his political career. She also reveals why she was attracted to Weiner in the first place. “One of the things that, because we became friendly, I found striking about Anthony was how smart he was, what a great debater he was. He was smart, he was passionate,” she said. “When he wanted to do something that he thought was the right thing to do, he would not give up. The kind of dedication and passion he had for helping people, I found very attractive and inspiring. ” The article notes that her father started the nonprofit group, the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs and that her mother was “an outspoken,   feminist. ” Just last week, details of yet another Weiner sexting scandal made headlines.
