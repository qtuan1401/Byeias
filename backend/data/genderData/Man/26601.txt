An armed citizen cornered armed robbers and told them, “My gun is bigger than yours. ”[According to Cleveland. com, police say two armed suspects, a    Parma man and an    Cleveland man, entered Suleyman’s Supermarket on Cleveland’s West Side just before 10 p. m. and demanded money.  The store owner gave the suspects around $300, and they turned to leave, only to see a police officer standing outside. Panicked, the two armed men ran through the store to exit in the back, but were stopped by a citizen with a gun. The citizen, a friend of the market’s owner, “grabbed” one of the suspects and “slammed him into the wall. ” The second suspect hid in a bathroom while the armed citizen stood outside the door saying, “My gun is bigger than yours. ” The police report indicates the suspect “surrendered and begged the man not to shoot him. ” The armed citizen ordered both suspects to the ground and disarmed them. The business owner “ordered the robbers to crawl out outside, where they were immediately arrested. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
