A $50, 000 ticket for Sunday’s Game 7 of the NBA Finals has broken StubHub’s record for the highest price ever paid to see a basketball game. [Actually, that’s two tickets: the customer bought a pair for one hundred grand.  And that new record could still be broken: other seats for the historic game on Father’s Day at the Oracle Arena in Oakland are advertised for even higher prices. Local San Francisco Bay Area CBS News affiliate KPIX reports: “One guy has tickets posted for $214, 000 each,” says Golden State Warriors spokesperson Brandon Schneider. “I don’t know if anyone is going to buy that, but I have seen that. ” The Warriors will host the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have overcome a   deficit over the past two games to force a   tie and a decisive Game 7. Golden State compiled the most dominant regular season record in the history of the NBA, going   breaking the record previously held by Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls in the   season. However, Stephen Curry and his crew have stumbled in the playoffs  —   first surviving a nasty scare in the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, and then squandering a huge lead in the Finals. On the Cleveland side, star player LeBron James is attempting to overcome a reputation for choking in the playoffs, and to vindicate his decision to leave the Miami Heat for his former hometown team. Tech wizards have warmed to Golden State in recent years, especially given the team’s reliance on “moneyball”   play that emphasizes perimeter shooting over    muscle. But LeBron has something to prove. And everyone in the Bay Area wants to be there. Game time: 5:00 p. m. Pacific  —   for free on ABC. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
