Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” while commenting on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton having to leave during the   memorial service, former NBC’s “Nightly News” anchor Tom Brokaw said of Democratic presidential nominee  Hillary Clinton, “I think that she should go to a hospital, see a neurologist, and get a clean report if it is available to her. ”  Brokaw said, “It also comes in the context where there has been a very vigorous campaign, both above ground and below ground by the Republicans to raise questions about her health. Rudy Giuliani has been on the air constantly saying, ‘Well I don’t have any facts, but if you look at here, something is amiss.’ Just this morning I had a rather detailed message from a Republican who was inside, and he was raising questions as well saying ‘I didn’t know if this is true, but here are the incidents that we are all watching.’ So that’s in play. We’re already seeing today the social media activity that is going on. I think that she should go to a hospital, see a neurologist, and get a clean report if it is available to her. This is not something that is going to be dealt with at her daughter’s apartment, in the context of where we are. ”
