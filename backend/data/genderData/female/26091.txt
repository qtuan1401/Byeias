A wedding proposal performed at a recent Bulls game in Chicago brought a sports writer for Sporting News over the moon. Not because he’s in love with love but because the proposal came from a gay man to his lover. The writer called the proposal, a “Groundbreaking Moment in Sports. ”[The moment occurred during the   game held Thursday night at Chicago’s United Center. The gay couple, identified as Michael and Jake, got engaged on center court during half time. The proposal, arranged ahead of time, came after a short dance routine by the Luvabulls and with the assistance of team mascot, Bennie the Bull.   Several Twitter users made note of the proposal. Cool, seeing a proposal for Michael  Jake on #Bulls center court. Crowd cheers!  —   Cheryl Raye Stout (@Crayestout) December 9, 2016,  But a writer for Sporting News, Tom Gatto, gushed that the proposal was “not your typical arena proposal, at all. ” “He said yes. And with that, one couple created a potentially groundbreaking moment in sports,” Gatto wrote enthusiastically. One Twitter user thought maybe it was a     proposal. Can anyone recall another   marriage proposal at an NBA game? Was this the first one? Definitely first one I’ve seen in Chicago.  —   Sean Highkin (@highkin) December 9, 2016,  It appears that writer Gatto also thought the proposal a first and expressed his excitement of seeing more LGBT proposals at sports games. “With one   proposal now out on the internet, it should just be a matter of time before we see more of them across the country,” he wrote. But as it turns out, a lesbian couple beat Michael and Jake by a year. The lesbian couple performed their wedding proposal in December of 2015 at an Atlanta Hawks game.
