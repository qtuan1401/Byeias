Sometimes a little tough love is all it takes. [What a father at a Cavaliers game did to his son on Friday night certainly qualified. During the   game a fan, or more to the point, a father, held up a sign targeted at a very specific audience:   The son is not only denied the chance to see the greatest basketball player on the face of the Earth, but now his harsh lesson on the importance of academia has turned into a cacophony of internet mockery: Still can’t believe this sign that this father was holding up during the Cavs game pic. twitter.   —   Mike Mugavero (@mi_mug11) March 25, 2017,  Awww come on Thomas!
