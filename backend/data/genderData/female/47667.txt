’  ’ ’   Rising inequality is one of the major problems developed   economies face today  —   and the US is no exception. ’ ’   The top 1% of American earners captured  . ’ ’   And from 2009 to 2013, the top 1% took home 85. 1% of   total income growth. ’ ”   Moreover, the average American  ’s income of over   $1. 1 million is 25. 3 times as much as the average   income of everyone else  —   $45, 567. ” ”   But a particularly striking part of the EPI’s report is their   exploration of inequality at not just the national level, but   also at the state and metropolitan level. ” ’   ”Rising inequality is not just a story of those in the financial   sector in the greater New York City metropolitan area reaping   outsized rewards from speculation in financial markets,” Mark   Price,  ’ ’   “It’s a persistent problem throughout the country  —   in big cities   and small towns, in all 50 states. In the face of this national   problem, we need national policy solutions to jumpstart wage   growth for the vast majority,” Price added in an emailed version   of the report. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Moreover, nine states, 54 metropolitan areas, and 165 counties   have inequality gaps wider than the national gap of 25. 3 times.   The most unequal states were New York, Connecticut, and   Wyoming, where the top 1% earned average incomes more than 40   times those of the bottom 99%. ’ ’   Meanwhile, the most unequal metro area was Jackson,    —   where   the top 1% makes 213. o times more than the bottom 99%. And the   most unequal county was Teton County, Wyoming, which   is part of the Jackson,   metro area,   where the top 1% makes 233. 0 times more than the bottom 99%.   (Although we should note that both of these areas have small   populations, which are more likely to yield wacky numbers.) ’ ’   Using data from the report, we put together a map showing how   many times more the average top   makes compared to   the average bottom   in every US state.
