The suspect in the May 5 shooting in Beltsville, Maryland, was the subject of a stayaway order that included a prohibition on personal gun possession. [The suspect, Eulalio Tordil, allegedly shot his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, outside a high school as she was waiting to pick up their children.  Eulalio was ordered to surrender all firearms on March 17 as part of the stay away order against him. Gabby Giffords and Moms Demand Action have long contended that gun prohibitions tied to protective orders will keep women safe. According to WTOP, Eulalio allegedly pulled up behind Gladys as she was waiting outside “High Point High School to pick up her children at around 4:40 p. m. ” They had an argument that escalated to the point that Eulalio allegedly shot and killed her and also shot and wounded a good Samaritan who tried to intervene. Eulalio escaped from the scene and is still at large. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
