Former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder urged Americans to give former Republican Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a chance to prove himself as the nation’s new attorney general. [“It seems you ought to give people a chance, unless they’re wholly unqualified,” Holder said during brief remarks at the University at Buffalo, on Thursday. “He may end up surprising us and he maybe will say, ‘This is who I always was,’ and I may end up saying, ‘Well I’ve seen growth then,’” Holder added.  Holder added he plans to be “very sparing in my criticisms because I know how tough the job is, I know how tough the decisions are,” though he worried Sessions will cross “red lines” on voting rights. According to the Buffalo News, Holder also urged his    audience to avoid “ideological blindness” along with “dangerous complacency. ” Holder did not oppose Sessions’ nomination despite furious objections from Democrats.
