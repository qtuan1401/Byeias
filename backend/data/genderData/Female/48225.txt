’  ’ ’   Vice Media will go on an acquisition spree next year as Shane   Smith’’s company looks to take advantage of a ”bloodbath” of   consolidation in the   industry. ’ ’   Smith, Vice’’s cofounder and chief executive, said the     giant is building a ”war chest” of funding to   ”go out there and buy market share.” ’ ’   He made the comments in a press briefing ahead of delivering the    at the  a landmark event in the   British TV industry calendar. ’ ’   Smith predicted that 2017 will be a period of enormous   consolidation in the   business, with another   economic crash fueling a ”bloodbath” of deals as   buyers   build scale and online content firms strive to secure much needed   cash. ’ ’   Smith also shared some rumours about potentially     takeovers being speculated about in US media   circles. One persistent rumour, he said, is that . ’ ’   ”What you’re going to see is a    frenzy   where the last two or three big boys buy the last scale plays to   say, ’’We’ve got digital, we’ve got mobile, so we’re smart. ’’ And   the digital guys are going to go, ’’    thank god  —   we’ve   finally got money,’’” Smith said. ’ ’   Expanding on his theme in his speech, Smith said Facebook and   Google’’s algorithm changes have exacerbated matters. ”What does   this do? Well, it’s bad. It means a lot less traffic and a lot   less money,” he told delegates in an   address at the   Edinburgh Playhouse. ’ ’   ”The smart guys,” Smith added in the press briefing, ”have taken   their valuations at their peak,” pointing to companies including   BuzzFeed  —   which raised    last year  —   and  (£249 million) in 2015. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tHe’’s off.  admits he’’s had ”a few ales” in his opening salvo.   ’ ’   He predicts there will be 30% fewer digital players by next year   and suggested that Vice is well positioned to take advantage of   the changes. ’ ’   Vice Media counts Disney and News Corp. among its backers. Disney      after doubling its investment to $400 million (£303 million) last   year. ’ ’   Rupert Murdoch’’s  in 2013   for $70 million ($53 million). The company is valued at $5   billion (£3. 8 billion). Smith argued: ”The secret to Vice’s   valuation is very simple: We make money.” ’ ’   He did not rule out the prospect of Disney buying Vice outright   but said its investment will help Vice ”turn on the jets” in its   mission to grow its monthly audience from 380 million to 1   billion. ’ ’   Speaking ahead of the launch of TV channel Viceland in the UK   this year, Smith argued that creating content with a social   purpose for young people is not just good for humankind but good   for business. ’ ’   “Baby boomers have had a stranglehold on media and advertising   for a generation,” he said. “That stranglehold is finally being   broken by a highly educated, ethnically diverse,        generation, and media is having a hard time   adapting to this rapid change. ” ’ ’   He added: ”Let’s break some rules. And here’s a good place to   start. Open     up. Media today is like a private club, so   closed that most young people feel disenfranchised. You have to   hand it over to the kids.” ’ ’   In a break from tradition, Smith delivered most of his address   without a script. ’ ”   Journalists were not given an embargoed copy of his speech  —   the   first time that’s happened for a MacTaggart in a least a decade  —     and instead they were briefed by Smith himself on the morning of   the lecture. ”
