In his own statement, Katzenberg said the deal “not only delivers significant value for our shareholders, but also supports NBCUniversal’s growing family entertainment business. ” “Having spent the past two decades working together with our team to build DreamWorks Animation into one of the world’s most beloved brands, I am proud to say that NBCUniversal is the perfect home for our company a home that will embrace the legacy of our storytelling and grow our businesses to their fullest potential,” Katzenberg said. The deal ends DreamWorks Animation’s   and often frustrating search for a prospective buyer. The studio had been in negotiations to sell to toymaker Hasbro in 2014 before the deal was derailed by a media leak. Before that, the studio saw a $3. 4 billion sale to Japan’s SoftBank fall through.
