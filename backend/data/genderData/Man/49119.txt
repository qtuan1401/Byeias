’’ ’Hindus around the world came together over the weekend to celebrate Diwali, otherwise known as the festival of lights.’ ’Diwali is considered one of the most auspicious times of the year for Hindus, and it marks the beginning of a new year in the Hindu calendar. ’ ’Though Diwali itself is one day, the rituals typically last over a   period, during which people celebrate by gathering with friends and family, lighting candles and firecrackers, and creating festive decorations meant to invite Goddess Lakshmi  —   the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity  —   into their homes. ’ ’In addition to India, Diwali is also widely celebrated in countries like Britain, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the United States. ’
