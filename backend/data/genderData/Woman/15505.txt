A hacker took control of Twitter accounts belonging to supporters of the Islamic State and replaced   content with gay pride images and pornography, and an excerpt proclaiming, “I’m Gay and Proud. ”[The hacker is reportedly part of the hacktivist collective known as Anonymous and hacked the accounts in response to the terrorist attack at a gay club in Orlando, which left 50 people dead and many more injured.  Speaking to Newsweek, the hacker, who uses the online moniker WauchulaGhos, said: ““I did it for the lives lost in Orlando, ISIS have been spreading and praising the attack, so I thought I would defend those that were lost. The taking of innocent lives will not be tolerated. ” He also claims to have hacked over 200 Twitter accounts of Islamic State supporters, although many of his efforts are lost as Twitter takes the accounts down soon after. He plans to continue his hacking with two other hackers called Ebony and Yeti. However, he also said that he does not intend to offend ordinary Muslims. “Our actions are directed at Jihadist extremists. Many of our own [group of hackers] are Muslim and we respect all religions that do not take innocent lives. ” The Anonymous collective has previously declared war on ISIS following attacks in both Paris and Brussels, saying it has “silence thousands of Twitter accounts directly linked to ISIS,” vowing “not to rest as long as terrorists continue their actions around the world. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
