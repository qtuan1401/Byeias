New York City’s sports talk radio host Mike Francesa delivered a rant today on his show against protesters of the killing of   Harambe the gorilla, who was shot dead Saturday after a    boy fell into the Cincinnati Zoo exhibit.  Francesa ripped into protesters who are upset the zoo killed Harambe after he dragged the boy across the exhibit, leaving him hospitalized with serious injuries. “Could you imagine if that was your child in there?” Francesa said. “You’re gonna have people who are gonna say, ‘Wait a second, I’m worried about the gorilla,’ when your kid’s in there basically maybe seconds from having his head crushed?” “We live in a world now where you are gonna be more concerned with a gorilla than you are the little boy? What’s wrong with you people?” he later added. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
