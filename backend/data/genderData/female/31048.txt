Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for Hillary Clinton on Monday afternoon, joking that he has less money than his Senate colleague Bernie Sanders. [“As I pointed out, it was embarrassing. Bernie Sanders’ net worth is more than mine,” he said, putting his head in his hands as he feigned embarrassment. “I have less money than a socialist. I don’t know what the hell happened to me. ”  Biden joked that he hoped his children would get rich so that he could get a “room with a view” once he was put in a retirement home. “I’ve been doing this for 44 years. I mean, you think I’m kidding. I’m not kidding, unfortunately,” he said. Biden frequently admits in speeches that he has never been gainfully employed. “I’ve never been gainfully employed in my life,” he told an audience in Washington, D. C. in May. “I don’t know what the hell I’m going to do. ” In August, Sanders bought a nearly $600, 000 vacation home in the Champlain Islands in Vermont after he conceded the Democratic primary to Hillary Clinton.
