’  ’ ’   Black Friday is losing its relevancy to   US shoppers.  ’ ’   The holiday, which takes place the day after Thanksgiving,   has historically been the biggest shopping day of the year in the   US. ’ ’   But over the last several years, shopper traffic in stores on   Black Friday has been falling with many retailers like Walmart,   Target, and Amazon kicking off their holiday discounts online   several weeks in advance. ’ ’   Foot traffic in stores this year is expected to fall by about   3. 5% on Black Friday compared to last year, according to data   from the location tracking service Foursquare.  ’ ”   That’s coming on the heels of several years of declines. ” ’  ’ ”   That doesn’t mean people aren’t shopping during the holidays   anymore. They just aren’t saving their purchases for Black   Friday, or for Cyber Monday, for that matter. Many are choosing   to shop online, rather than in stores. ” ’  ’ ”   About 137. 4 million people are expected to shop in stores   and online over the Thanksgiving weekend, according to a survey   by the National Retail Federation. That’s up from 135. 8 million   who shopped over the long weekend last year. ” ’   Overall spending during the holiday period is expected to   increase 3. 6% over last year to $655. 8 billion. ’ ’   Online sales are forecast to grow between 7% and 10% over last   year to as much as $117 billion. ’ ’   But nearly half of American shoppers are expected to get most of   their holiday shopping done before Black Friday this year,   according to a survey by Market Track, a     advertising firm. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
