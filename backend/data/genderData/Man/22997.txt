Patrick Healy of the NYT pens an   slobber job on Hillary Clinton: in her first 100 days, she’ll appoint a historically diverse Cabinet, work with Republicans on “broadly popular issues,” and  —   psst!  —   probably decline to replace Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who just happened to speak privately with her husband Bill last week.    Salon alumnus David Sirota puts this development in context: Team Clinton suggest it will offer AG Lynch a job in the new admin, as Lynch’s DoJ investigates Clinton https:  .   —   David Sirota (@davidsirota) July 4, 2016,  From the New York Times: In her first 100 days, she would also tap women to make up half of her cabinet in hopes of bringing a new tone and collaborative sensibility to Washington, while also looking past Wall Street to places like Silicon Valley for talent  —   perhaps wooing Sheryl Sandberg from Facebook, and maybe asking Tim Cook from Apple to become the first openly gay cabinet secretary.   …     She hopes to reassure progressives with her executive actions, which would also include new protections for undocumented immigrant parents, as well as her personnel appointments. Having women make up half of her cabinet would be historic (in recent years, a quarter to a third of cabinet positions have been held by women) and Democrats close to Mrs. Clinton say she may decide to retain Ms. Lynch, the nation’s first black woman to be attorney general, who took office in April 2015.
