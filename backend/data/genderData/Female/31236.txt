For anyone looking for more proof that “sexual assault activist” Lena Dunham is a total fraud, the New York Times reports Wednesday that when the   is not out championing for Bill Clinton to become America’s first First Gentleman, privately she is “disturbed” by the wake of women in Bill’s past who have accused him of various forms of sexual assault, up to and including rape:  This month, Lena Dunham, wearing a red, white and blue sweater dress with the word “Hillary” emblazoned across the chest, told voters how Hillary Clinton had overcome sexism in her political career. “The way she has been treated is just more evidence of the fact that our country has so much hatred toward successful women,” Ms. Dunham, the creator and star of the HBO series “Girls,” said at a Clinton campaign event in Manchester, N. H. But at an Upper East Side dinner party a few months back, Ms. Dunham expressed more conflicted feelings. She told the guests, at the Park Avenue apartment of Richard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, that she was disturbed by how, in the 1990s, the Clintons and their allies discredited women who said they had had sexual encounters with or been sexually assaulted by former President Bill Clinton. Naturally, Dunham’s “people” deny the claim. But here’s the bottom line  …     Somewhere around a dozen women have accused Bill Clinton of everything from rape to groping to harassment. And Bill Clinton did settle a sexually harassment with Paula Jones. Moreover, many of these women also accuse Hillary of engaging in character assassination to protect their abuser. While she uses all of her political capital to put Bill Clinton back into the White House, Dunham has compared Bill Cosby to the Holocaust, Apparently, Dunham believes that this kind of behavior and these types of allegations are only wrong if tied to a black man. I’m certainly open to other explanations.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
