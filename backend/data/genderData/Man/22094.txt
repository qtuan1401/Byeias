Wallace, who earlier this month became the first journalist from Fox News to be chosen to moderate a presidential debate  spoke to the network’s Howard Kurtz about the difficulties of the job and his aim to “ask smart questions” and “engage the two [candidates] in conversation. ” But when Kurtz asked how Wallace planned to negotiate a campaign fraught withfalsehoods and unfounded accusations, Wallace’s answer was less than comforting. “That’s not my job,” Wallace, who hosts Fox News Sunday, said. “I do not believe that it’s my job to be a truth squad.
