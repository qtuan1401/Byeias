Today marks the 72nd anniversary of   and Google has decided to sit on their hands for it. [On June 6th, 1944, American forces stormed the beaches of Western Europe in the bravest and largest amphibious attack in history. A battle that turned the tide against Nazi Germany and changed the course of World War II hasn’t earned itself a Google homepage doodle, however.  Interestingly enough, you may remember Google’s homepage from May 19th where they honored Yuri Kochiyama, a social activist who openly praised Osama bin Laden, Malcolm X, and Fidel Castro for their work. In addition, Google also recently fell quiet on Memorial Day. As Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos stated: This is the website that has a special logo (called a Doodle) for everything. Whether it is Independence Day in Jordan or the start of the hundredth Tour of Flanders, Google has a special logo to celebrate it. Of course all the stops are pulled out for Earth Day, that most holy of liberal holidays. It’s really quite strange how Google found the time to mock up a drawing for Teacher Day in South Korea, but not the memorial of our country’s bravest fallen soldiers. Only the future will tell what other highly important events Google will conveniently forget to doodle about.
