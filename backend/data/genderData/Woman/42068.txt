 (CNN) It’s probably a publicity stunt, but we kind of love that Mariah Carey is on Match. com. The singer’s new video for her single ”Infinity” features her on the dating site, searching for love. It turns out that her profile is the real deal, and Carey (whose split with husband Nick Cannon in 2014 shocked fans) is single and ready to mingle. Let’s break down her Match. com profile, shall we? She doesn’t mind being a cougar. The    chanteuse is seeking men ” .” Carey was married to music mogul Tommy Mottola, who’s 20 years her elder, from  . But Cannon is 11 years younger than she is, so we’re guessing that Carey is looking more along the lower end of that scale than along the higher. Don’t forget that she’s a savvy businesswoman.  This is a woman who has plenty of product placement in her new video    including bottles of the perfume she hawks    and let’s not forget that all this began as a way to get even more attention for her new song. (There’s no word yet from Match on whether it’s paying Carey for the promotion.) As if she didn’t already have us trying to figure out whether lyrics like ”Why you trying to play like you’re so   you own, boy, you still owe” are about Cannon. Messy.    dudes don’t stand a chance. Carey is looking for a man within a   radius of New York. Sorry, West Coasters.  Get ready for some home cooking. According to her profile, the singer likes to cook as well as watch movies and videos. Who knew? The former ”American Idol” judge, who has    twins with Cannon, debuted the music video and profile on Tuesday and is wishing other single women good luck in the hunt for love. ”I hope every woman who is single and listens to this song goes out and finds her infinity,” Carey said in a statement to Us Weekly. ”Whether on Match or the traditional way.” Carey: ’Worst experience of my life’
