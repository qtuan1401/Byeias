Stephen Battaglio reports in the Los Angeles Times that conservative commentator Tucker Carlson is taking over hosting Greta Van Susteren’s prime time show “On the Record” for Fox News. [From the Los Angeles Times:  Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson is getting his own nightly program on Fox News Channel starting Nov. 14, according to people familiar with the plan. Carlson is taking over the 7 p. m. ET time period long held by Greta Van Susteren, who left earlier this year over a contract dispute. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume has filled in since Van Susteren’s departure in early September. A Fox News spokesperson declined comment when asked about the plan for Carlson on Wednesday. But word that the program is close to a done deal is already making its way around Washington circles. Carlson will be the first major talent hire since former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes was forced out of the company over sexual harassment allegations. Read the rest here.
