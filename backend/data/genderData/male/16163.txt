Tiger Woods’ agent, Mark Steinberg, denied claims made by Fox Sports senior reporter Robert Lusetich that the golf icon’s health condition threatens his return to the tour. [“The tweets that appeared this weekend about Tiger’s health are ridiculous and absolutely false. It’s reprehensible that every few months someone makes something up and it’s treated like a real story,” Steinberg asserted. “Tiger continues to work on his rehabilitation and we will have an accurate update at the appropriate time. ”  Lusetich tweeted: I’m told #TigerWoods condition worsened. He can’t move well painful to sit. Sits in car with seat fully reclined. No forseeable return. Sad,  —   Robert Lusetich (@RobertLusetich) February 22, 2016,  About  % of microdiscectomies  —   like #Tiger had  —   are successful. He got unlucky. Not to say career’s over, but no imminent return.  —   Robert Lusetich (@RobertLusetich) February 22, 2016,  The Fox Sports writer has a history of making pessimistic statements about Woods. Lusetich was quick to point out last July that “Tiger Woods is close to being done,” after he failed to make the cut at the British Open championship. Woods missed cuts at the U. S. Open and the PGA  Open in 2015 as well. Steinberg could not offer any details on Woods’ recovery or when the   major champion plans to tee it up again in a tournament. According to CBS Sports “Lusetich has been embedded with Woods for years, so anything he’s reporting about an update is solid. This is not good if you’re a Woods fan. ” Woods said in December that his back problems are different than issues he had with it in the past. He explained, “Does that mean I’m not going to rehab and train and fight to get back? Of course I am. I’m far from being done. ” Kyle Porter reports for CBS that the Masters will not be happening for Woods in 2016. Moreover, he writes: “In fact, 2016 is not going to happen. Will we see Woods back in 2017 or beyond? Even that is starting to appear murky. ”
