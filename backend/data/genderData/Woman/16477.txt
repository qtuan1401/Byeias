A woman who was shot and killed Thursday had previously gone door to door trying to set up a neighborhood watch group in her South Sacramento neighborhood.[    Ariyana Jones “was shot about 7:30 p. m. inside her house in the 6700 block of Tortola Way. ”  According to the Sacramento Bee, “Jones was a teacher and had gone door to door months ago to start a neighborhood watch group in response to a string of robberies in the area. ” Her neighbor, Allene Boulware, said, “[Jones’] main concern was about the   in the houses around here and for the community to try to get together to see what we could do as a community to stop the crime that was going on. ” Jones taught at Sacramento Country Day School, where headmaster Lee Thomsen said her fellow teachers and “the school community” as a whole are in shock over her death. He said Jones “was one of those educators who when you meet them, even at that young age, you know that they have ‘it. ’” He added, “She had an energy. We saw her as someone who we wanted to groom to be a future leader on our faculty. She was a tremendous person. ” Jones was a wife and mother of two children: a    son and a    daughter.
