Former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis is excoriating the Black Lives Matter movement for its silence about the rising rates of    crime. [“The things that’s ran in the newspapers have disturbed me,” the ESPN NFL analyst said in an emotional video posted on his Facebook page on April 2.  He said: I’m trying to figure out if black lives really matter, then in Chicago alone the murder rate has soared 72 percent in 2016.   percent in the first three months of 2016 compared to last year. I’m trying to ask the question to an organization of black lives, if they really mattered, then why not riot now? Indeed, as Breitbart News’ Warner Todd Huston reported last week, “According to DNAinfo. com, the first three months of 2016 have seen more shootings than the first three months of any year in over a decade. With 790 shot so far this year, that is over 80 percent higher then the 419 March ended with in 2015. ” In the emotional video posted, Lewis said he is “trying to figure out in [his] mind why no one is paying attention to black men killing black men. ” The    former NFL star, who knows a thing or two about violent   himself, castigated Black Lives Matter for protesting and marching in the streets after a black person is killed by law enforcement, while remaining silent as    murder rates skyrocket. “Why do we always find ourselves half the victims, and now we have the separation once again that we’re being victimized because of one bad white cop, two bad white cops, three bad white cops, killing a young black brother,” Lewis said. “But every day we have    crime killing each other.   …     The March murder rate rose by 29 percent, but we’re not rioting in the streets about black on black killing each other. ” Lewis’ video has garnered more than two million views on Facebook.
