 (CNN) Someone is posting stickers that say ”exclusively for white people” on businesses in the Texas capital of Austin. And the mayor is not amused.  ”This is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city,” Mayor Steve Adler said in a statement. ”Our city is a place where respect for all people is a part of our spirit and soul. We will keep it that way.”  In addition to the disparaging words, the stickers are using the city’s logo, giving the impression that they represent Austin.  They do not, the mayor said.  ”The stickers were neither produced nor knowingly displayed by the businesses and were removed by their employees when discovered this morning,” he said Wednesday.  The stickers were placed between midnight Tuesday and 7 a. m. Wednesday. It’s unclear how many businesses were affected, but those that were targeted took them off, officials said.  City officials, businesses and  the police are on the lookout for  the culprits.  ”This type of cowardly and hateful act will not be tolerated in this city,” City Manager Marc Ott  said.
