John Stossel writes at Reason that the documentary film “Clinton Cash,” based on Peter Schweizer’s bestselling book and new graphic novel of the same name, shows how Bill and Hillary Clinton “continue to thrive despite their remarkable record of sleazy dealings. ”[This week, as Democrats fawn over Hillary Clinton, I’m struck by how both Clintons continue to thrive despite their remarkable record of sleazy dealings.  The just released documentary Clinton Cash, based on a book by Peter Schweizer, explains how they make big money by selling access to themselves. On my TV show, Schweizer said the Clintons use “speaking fees” to get around bribery laws. “If somebody gave a politician or family member money for a favor, that’s breaking the law. But if you say it’s a speaking fee, and you pay double or triple the normal rate, that seems to be legal. ”Since Bill Clinton left office, he’s earned more than $126 million giving speeches. Nothing wrong with that. Bill likes to talk, and if people want to pay big bucks to hear him or just to say they were near him, so be it. It’s their own money. But what suggests influence peddling, says Schweizer, is that before Hillary became secretary of state, Bill’s usual fee was less than $200, 000. But after Hillary became secretary of state, he made as much as $750, 000 per speech. That’s “evidence that people paying him expect to get something in return,” says Schweizer. “She becomes appointed secretary of state, a friend of the president of Nigeria suddenly offers (Bill) $700, 000 apiece for two speeches. An investment firm in Moscow that’s tied to the Kremlin who had never paid for him to speak before suddenly gave him $500, 000. ” Those are just two of many examples cited in Clinton Cash. Sometimes the Clintons launder the money through the Clinton Foundation. It’s collected more than $2 billion to “improve global health and wellness. ” Read the rest here.
