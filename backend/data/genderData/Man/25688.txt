On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Huffington Post Senior Politics Editor Sam Stein stated that the $1 million birthday gift from Qatar to former President Bill Clinton “confirms sort of the worst portraits of the Clintons, and how they operated out of office. ”  Stein said, “I mean, this, as Mark [Halperin] said, this confirms sort of the worst portraits of the Clintons, and how they operated out of office. And it raises obvious questions about why they were accepting this money. Now, you know, there were charitable purposes that went along with the Clinton Foundation, but, of course, it came with a conflict of interest. ” (  GOP War Room) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
