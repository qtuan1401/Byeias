’  ’ ’   The New England Patriots have a bit of a quarterback emergency   going into their Week 3 game against the Houston Texans on   Thursday. ’ ”   With Tom Brady suspended and  the Patriots have rookie quarterback Jacoby   Brissett  —   and that’s it. ” ’   This is going to force the Patriots to get creative with their   backup situation, something Bill Belichick specializes in. ’ ”   It’s uncertain if Garoppolo will be able to play Thursday, but it   looks unlikely, meaning Brissett may be thrown into the fire to   start against one of the best pass rushes in the NFL. ” ’   With  the Patriots are unlikely to sign a   free agent for insurance, the Patriots may actually have to turn   to another position player entirely  —   wide receiver Julian   Edelman. ’ ’’ ”   Edelman played quarterback in college for Kent State and played   it quite well. However, given his smaller stature, he switched to   wide receiver coming out of the draft before joining the   Patriots. If the Patriots don’t want to bring in a free agent   quarterback to try and learn the offense in three days, they   could use Edelman as a backup option if Brissett were to get   hurt. ” ’   Edelman, of course, hasn’’t run an NFL offense and has been a   receiver now for seven years. When asked about the idea,  ”I play receiver for a reason.”  ’ ”   Still, Edelman at least has experience at the position and he   knows the offense.  that there’s some hope that   Garoppolo may be able to dress and serve as a backup to Brissett,   perhaps running mostly   which would push Edelman to   third on the depth chart.  ” ”   It may be hard to imagine the Patriots really putting Edelman   under center. However, fortunes can change quickly in the NFL,   and if the Patriots really don’t want to bring in an outside   quarterback, then there is a chance we may see them run some sort   of wacky offense with a    at the helm. ”
