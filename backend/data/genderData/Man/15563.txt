On June 15, Senate Democrats launched a filibuster for background checks on private gun sales less than a month after Omar Mateen passed a background check to buy his guns at a retail store. [Senator Chris Murphy ( ) who led the filibuster, was interviewed by CNN on Monday and had trouble explaining how any new gun laws could stop a terrorist.  According to Roll Call, the current Democrat filibuster is aimed at expanding background checks to cover more private sales and online sales —  although Mateen did not buy his guns online or via a private sale. Moreover, Murphy is pushing to close the “gun show loophole,” but Mateen did not buy his guns at a gun show, either. Murphy also wants to ban   citizens’ from owning an “assault weapon. ” Senators Richard Blumenthal ( ) Dick Durbin ( .) and Cory Booker ( ) took turns holding the floor for the filibuster, as well. Booker cited “the numbers of people killed in   …     mass shootings in recent years. And he said the terrorist attacks are increasingly being committed with guns, not bombs. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
