During MSNBC’s coverage of the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, host Rachel Maddow stated that she found the top part of former President Bill Clinton’s speech to the DNC “shocking and rude. ”  Maddow began by giving the end of the speech an A+ but then said, “I think the beginning of the speech was a controversial way to start, honestly, talking about the girl, a girl, leading with this long story about him being attracted to an unnamed girl and thinking about whether he was starting something he couldn’t finish, building her whole political story, for the whole first half of the speech around her marriage to him. I think, unless there were worries that this is going to be too feminist a convention, that was not a feminist way to start. But the end of the speech was really good. I’ve got to say, the top of the speech I found shocking and rude. ” (  NTK Network) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
