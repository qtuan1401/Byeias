Democrat presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders is unable to argue for   because he is an insensitive male, claims Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( ). [Gillibrand wants the debate over gun control to be refashioned into a “women’s issue,” instead of a complicated dispute related to hunting or the Second Amendment.  Gillibrand criticizes male involvement in the   debate. Politico reports: This debate is relegated to the men. It’s about hunting? It has nothing to do with hunting,” [Gillibrand] said. “Nothing in this debate has to do with hunting, and nothing in this debate has to do with the Second Amendment rights. Nothing.   …     I think  —   I see the world in the lens of women’s issues. I’m making everything a woman’s issue. I want guns to be a woman’s issue. She suggests Sanders’ maleness prevents him from relating to mothers who have lost loved ones to gun crime. She also states that he “doesn’t have the sensitivity he needs to the horror that is happening in these families,” adding, “I just don’t think he’s fully getting how horrible it is for these families. ” Gillibrand supports Hillary Clinton over Sanders in the Democrat primary contest.
