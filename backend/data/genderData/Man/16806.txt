A former UKIP parliamentary candidate has recorded her second parody song to promote the Brexit campaign in the upcoming referendum. [Mother of two Mandy Boylett, the unsuccessful UKIP candidate for Stockton North at the 2015 General Election, has a history of producing musical videos to promote Brexit. Most famously she recorded a parody of the football anthem, ‘Three Lions (Football’s Coming Home)’  which she renamed ‘Britain’s Coming Home’.  Now the aerobics and pilates instructor has turned her hand to Pink’s pop classic ‘Get The Party Started’ to promote Brexit, and it is every bit as good as her fans will have expected. Mrs. Boylett told Teeside news website Gazette: “I wanted to get across a message that would be universally appreciated. I wanted it to be lighthearted and just thought I’d have a bit of fun. “I don’t think that many people will even know who [EU Council President] Donald Tusk is. ” She was referring to the lyric in her parody which mentions the President of the European Council as well as President of the European Commission,   Juncker: Donald Tusk is freakin’ as we’re voting Leave fast, Telling Mr. Juncker, you’ll be kissin’ my ass! Thanking UKIP for indulging her musical parodies, she added: “I think the Tory party would tell me to shut up. ”
