Pop superstar and style icon Madonna has fired back at critics of her risqué Met Ball gala outfit, explaining in a social media post that her   and   getup was meant as a political statement about women’s rights. [In an Instagram post on Wednesday, the    “Vogue” singer took her “ageist” and “sexist” critics to task for failing to look beyond the simples aesthetics of the dress to see its deeper political meaning.  “[W]e are still in the dark ages,” Madonna wrote. “My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement. The fact that people actually believe a woman is not allowed to express her sexuality and be adventurous past a certain age is proof that we still live in an   and sexist society. ” “I have never thought in a limited way and I’m not going to start,” she added. “We cannot effect change unless we are willing to take risks By being fearless and By taking the road leas traveled by [sic]. Thats how we change history. ”  We have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world. When it comes to Women’s rights we are still in the dark ages. My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement.

Thats how we change history.  If you have a problem with the way I dress it is simply a reflection of your prejudice. I’m not afraid to pave the way for all the girls behind me‼️ As Nina Simone once said, the definition of freedom is being fearless. I remain Unapologetic and a Rebel ❤️ in this life and all the others. Join my fight for Gender. Equality! 🙏🏻 A photo posted by Madonna (@madonna) on May 4, 2016 at 12:06pm PDT,  At an event known for its attendees’ daring style statements, Madonna turned heads in a sheer black Givenchy lace dress that exposed plenty of skin. Of course, this is hardly the first time the pop star has shown off her behind: she rocked a similarly risqué ensemble for the 2013 Met Ball’s “Punk: Chaos to Couture” event, and again at the 2015 Grammy Awards. In her Instagram post, Madonna warned detractors that criticism of the way she dresses is “simply a reflection of your prejudice. ” “I’m not afraid to pave the way for all the girls behind me! !” she wrote. “As Nina Simone once said, the definition of freedom is being fearless.
