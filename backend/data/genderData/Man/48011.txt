’  ’ ’   America has been   for decades, as manufacturing   becomes automated and moves to cheaper offshore locations.   Meanwhile,  believe   the United States economy has entered an era of ongoing   stagnation and is no longer nearly as innovative as it once was. ’ ’   But a  by the Brookings   Institution finds that what it calls advanced industries —  which   span the sectors of advanced technology services, advanced   manufacturing, and energy production —  have  and create good     jobs. That said, this growth has not spread   everywhere or in large enough measure. ’ ’   The study, by Mark Muro, Siddharth Kulkarni, and David M. Hart at   the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, finds that U. S.   advanced industries added $2. 8 trillion to the economy   in2015, making up 17 percent of the total U. S.   economic output. From 2013 to 2015, these industries accounted   for 60 percent of U. S. exports. They employed almost 13 million   people nationwide and accounted for 11. 3 percent of all U. S. job   growth in 2014 and 2015, adding more than 600, 000 new jobs.        Advanced industries also generate an additional economic boost   through their substantial “multiplier effects,” where the supply   chains of these industries generate an additional 2. 2 jobs for   every one they create. The Brookings study finds that these   industries directly or indirectly account for about 41. 3 million   total jobs, or 28 percent of total U. S. employment. ’ ’   The average worker in advanced industries earned $95, 000 in 2015,   nearly double what the average worker in other sectors earned,   which is about $53, 000. ’ ’  ’ ’   But not every advanced industry is growing at the same speed, or   necessarily growing at all. The sector’s growth is variable and   often inadequate. As the chart above shows, advanced   services —    industries such as computer systems design;   web search and internet publishing; software products; data   processing and hosting; R&D services and consulting —  have   accounted for the bulk of this growth, expanding between 2013 and   2015 on average by 5. 6 percent a year.    Indeed, the lion’s share of this growth comes from a narrow band   of tech and   advanced services industries. Just seven   individual industries —  three related to auto, and four to digital   services —  generated   of advanced industry growth.        Over the same period, advanced manufacturing sectors such as the   automotive industry grew at a much more modest average of 1. 7   percent a year from 2013 to 2015. In the midst of the global   downturn in the energy market, advanced energy industries such as   oil, gas, and fracking have declined an average of 1. 8 percent a   year from 2013 to 2015. ’ ’  ’ ’   Growth in advanced industries has been highly uneven across the   50 states. As the map above shows, the far West, the Southeast   and parts of the Midwest have seen the biggest gains in advanced   industries, while the biggest losses have occurred in Wyoming,   Alaska, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Vermont. ’ ’   Employment growth has increased in “ ” Northeastern   states such as New York and Massachusetts, and “ ”   Western states such as California, Oregon, Colorado, and Utah.   Employment growth has slowed in “ ” states   such as Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa, and it has   slowed even further in energy states like Oklahoma and North   Dakota, the center of the fracking boom. While the South consists   of six of the 10 states where the advanced industries have grown   the most, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and Kentucky, this   region is beginning to see a   as the   boom   in automotive manufacturing crests. ’ ’   This spiky and uneven pattern is even more amplified when we look   at metros. The top 20 metros accounted for 80 percent of advanced   industry growth in 2013 —  2015, compared to 71 percent in   2010 —  2013.  At the same time, 53 metros actually became less   specialized in these industries. ’ ’   The map below shows the pattern for metros. Dark blue dots   indicate the largest employment gains; red dots indicate the   largest declines. (Also, check out to   compare   of advanced industry output and employment   levels in the 100 largest U. S. metro areas). ’ ’  ’ ’   Note how varied the pattern is: Many states had both big winners   and big losers among their metros. The biggest winners were the   metro areas of San Francisco, Nashville, and Madison, while   Bakersfield, Tucson, and New Haven saw the biggest declines.   Knowledge and   metros in the Bay Area and the     Corridor, along with Raleigh and Provo saw   considerable employment growth. A number of metros with large   advanced manufacturing clusters, such as Grand Rapids, Toledo,   Nashville, Boise, and Indianapolis also did well. But many more   struggled. Metros with large   economies such as   Oklahoma City, Tulsa, and New Orleans, or with large     plants such as Birmingham, Little Rock, and   Scranton saw substantial declines in employment. ’ ’   The report notes that a single sector, computer design services,   was the “big star” of advanced industry growth of  . This   sector is highly concentrated in six metros: San Francisco, San   Jose, New York, Boston, Washington, D. C. and Los Angeles. But   the industry also comprises one of the three largest sources of   advanced industry job growth in 71 metros.    ’ ’   America’s advanced industry economy has been a powerful driver of   its productivity and growth since the economic crisis. But that   growth has been increasingly spurred by   sectors, while   advanced manufacturing has slowed and energy production has   declined. Its impact has been uneven geographically as well. The   growth of   states and metros has slowed, while     states and metros have declined. The core pillar of   sustainable U. S. economic growth remains tech, knowledge, and   talent. And while all of those factors are highly concentrated in   the superstar cities and tech hubs of the Bay Area, Southern   California and the   Corridor, many other metros   are benefiting from them to some extent. ’
