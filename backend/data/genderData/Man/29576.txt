In a clip from an interview set to air on Friday’s broadcast of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” President Barack Obama expressed his intent to take action against Russia for its alleged effort to impact the “integrity” of last month’s election.  Obama said that action may be “explicit and publicized” and some of it may not be, adding Russian President Vladimir Putin was aware of Obama’s sentiment on the issue. “I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action,” Obama said. “And we will  —   at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be. But Mr. Putin is aware of my feelings about this because I spoke to him directly about it. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
