If former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is elected president, she says she plans to put her husband in one of the biggest roles of her presidency. [“My husband, who I’m going to put in charge of revitalizing the economy, cause you know he knows how to do it,” Clinton said at a rally in Kentucky on Sunday according to ABC News. “And especially in places like coal country and inner cities and other parts of our country that have really been left out. ”  Clinton’s remarks are the strongest signal to date that her election will signal a third term for her husband former president Bill Clinton. Earlier this month, she told voters in Kentucky that her husband would “come out of retirement” to help her restore jobs in areas hit hard by the loss of manufacturing and coal mining. But Bill Clinton is far from his wife at the moment, campaigning for her in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico ahead of the primary caucuses there in June. Hillary Clinton is campaigning urgently in Kentucky after losing to Sen. Bernie Sanders in West Virginia last week. After hosting two events in the state yesterday, she is scheduled for three more campaign events on Monday before the election Tuesday. Earlier this month, Bill Clinton held about a   campaign events for his wife in the state. Clinton has focused on rallying the   vote in the state, running ads featuring the voice of Morgan Freeman to tout her credentials of fighting racism. She has also focused on generating sympathy for herself, pointing out that the “right wing” was going to “throw everything including the kitchen sink” at her because she chose to run for president. The state of Oregon will also host its primary on Tuesday, but the Clinton campaign has been largely abandoned efforts there as polls show the more liberal rival Sen. Bernie Sanders leading big.
