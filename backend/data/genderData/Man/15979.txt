Friday in a report from Fox News Channel’s Peter Doocy, Rep. Mike McCaul ( ) the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, explained that following a briefing on the shooting of a Philadelphia police officer by a suspect that had claimed to be acting at the behest of ISIS, it was his conclusion that individual was acting at the direction of ISIS.  “So once again we have a radicalized individual in the United States trying to kill law enforcement,” McCaul said. “And when you look at the Internet activity coming out of Raqqa, Syria, into the United States every day  —   200, 000 tweets per day  —   the message is clear: Kill military, attack military installations, and kill police officers. It’s in my judgment that this individual’s carrying out these directives  —   these orders, if you will  —   coming out of Raqqa, Syria, from ISIS. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor,
