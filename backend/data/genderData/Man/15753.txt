The police in Queensland, Australia, confiscated an     launcher from the Townsville Crocodiles, an Australian   team, by claiming the popular device is a “category B weapon” that must be registered with the government. [The Crocodiles general manager, Rob Honan, said the Queensland Police “ballistics unit informed the venue that essentially it was a category B weapon and it needed to be handed in, otherwise people in possession of it would be prosecuted,” according to the Brisbane Times.  The Queensland Police explained that the   launcher must be licensed and registered to the user, and because of this, it also must be properly manufactured  —   it cannot be homemade. The police explicitly stated that such weapons “can only be manufactured by a licensed armorer. ” By applying the label of category B weapon to a PVC pipe which uses air pressure to launch   authorities have placed the   launcher “in the same category as a single shot   rifle, a double barrel   rifle, a repeating   rifle, a break action shotgun and   rifle combination. ” The Townsville Crocodiles are now thinking about getting a slingshot with which to launch shirts into the crowd. A better example of the insidious nature of gun control would be difficult  —   if not impossible  —   to find.
