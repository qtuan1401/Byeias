 (CNN) Matthew Apperson has been charged Thursday with second degree attempted murder in last month’s shooting of George Zimmerman.   ”Our law enforcement community and the State Attorney’s Office works vigorously to ensure people may travel our busy streets, going about their business, without fear. Every resident and visitor to Seminole County deserves this freedom,” said State Attorney Phil Archer. ”My reaction to these charges is a pronounced shrug,”  Apperson’s attorney Michael LaFay told CNN. ”I’ve reviewed the charges and they don’t change the facts.   The prosecutors have put their heads together and tried to contemplate what could be the most serious charges, but that doesn’t really change anything. This is a case of  .” Apperson also faces charges of shooting into an occupied vehicle and aggravated assault with with a firearm.  He is accused of firing at Zimmerman on May 11 while driving down a street in Lake Mary, Florida. The bullet went through Zimmerman’s passenger window and narrowly missed him, according the police report. Apperson claims that Zimmerman pointed a gun at him first and that is when he rolled down his window and shot at him. Apperson exhibited unusual behavior and appeared to have a  fixation with Zimmerman, according to the report.  Zimmerman became a public figure when he fatally shot teenager Trayvon Martin. He was acquitted of charges in 2013. Apperson claimed Zimmerman threatened him last year during a   incident and that Zimmerman was stalking him outside his house. Lake Mary Police were called each time, but police said Apperson chose not to press charges.  His arraignment is scheduled for June 23.
