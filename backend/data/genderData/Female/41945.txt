 (The Hollywood Reporter) Mariah Carey got candid on Australia’s ”Kyle and Jackie O” show on Wednesday, describing her time on ”American Idol” as ”the worst experience of my life.” When questioned if she would return for the upcoming season 15 ”American Idol” series finale on the radio show, Carey declined: ”Hell no! Absolutely not. That was the worst experience of my life.” ”I’m not going to get into what it was, but let’s just say I don’t think they had any intentions for us to have a good experience doing that show. Pitting two females against each other wasn’t cool,” Carey said, referencing the    tensions she shared with fellow season 12 judge Nicki Minaj. ’American Idol’ ending with season 15, ”It should have been about the contestants instead of about some nonexistent feud that turned into even more ridiculousness,” Carey said. ”I would never want to be involved with it again. But everybody else did like it.” She continued that her time spent at the judges’ table was ”boring.” ”It’s so boring and so fake, I’m sorry. When I say it’s fake, I mean, I have to make up things to say about everybody. Half the time, the performances are good, you’ll just be like, ’It was good. ’” Fox announced on May 11 that it renewed ”American Idol” for its 15th and final season, with Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr. each returning to judge, with Ryan Seacrest as host.
