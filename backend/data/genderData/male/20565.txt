Saturday at a campaign rally in Chicago, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) a candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, took at dig at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has come out to endorse Sanders’ competitor Hillary Clinton.  Sanders thanked Emanuel for not giving him his endorsement because of all the struggles Chicago has been facing under his leadership. “I don’t want the endorsement of a mayor who is shutting down school after school and firing teachers,” Sanders said. “As you know, Hillary Clinton proudly lists Mayor Rahm Emanuel as one of her leading mayoral endorsers, I believe he is at the top of the list of mayors who are endorsing her,” he added. “Based on his disastrous record as mayor of the City of Chicago, I do not want Mayor Emanuel’s endorsement if I win the Democratic nomination,” Sanders continued. “That is not the kind of support that I want to take,” he continued. “We want the endorsement of people who are fighting for social and racial justice, we do not want the support of people who are indebted to Wall Street and the big money interests. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
