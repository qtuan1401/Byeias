GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson released his plan to fix the U. S. immigration system, calling it a “Prescription for a Sovereign America. ”[Carson pledges that as president he will do the following:  1) securing the border, 2) implementing sensible admission and removal procedures, 3) offering a solution for the large illegal immigrant population already here in the United States, 4) addressing legal immigration, 5) restoring the concept of the American melting pot, “We simply cannot afford to ignore our broken immigration system any longer,” Carson stated. Career politicians in Washington have opted to play games rather than solve the problems unregulated immigration has caused for the American people. As President, I will restore faith in America’s laws through fair and equal enforcement, while investing the resources and personnel necessary to protect and seal our border. Our founders sought a nation of immigrants and laws. I share their vision, and will return this country back to the hands of “We the People. ” Carson’s plan comes just one day before the Iowa caucus, the first electoral contest in the Republican presidential primary. Carson visited the U. S.  border in August 2015, taking a helicopter ride over drug cartel strongholds 70 miles in U. S. territory with Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu in Arizona. A brief inspection of a section of border fencing left the neurosurgeon unimpressed: “This is a nice small impediment that certainly wouldn’t keep anybody out,” Carson told reporters.
