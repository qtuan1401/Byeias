 (CNN) Miranda Lambert released her first new song in more than a year on Monday. On ”Vice,” the Grammy winner sings regretfully about crawling out of a beds she shouldn’t be in and walking home with shoes in hand. The second verse ends with the line, ”If you need me, I’ll be where my reputation don’t precede me. Maybe I’m addicted to goodbyes.”  Unlike Lambert’s fiery singles, ”Little Red Wagon” and ”Gunpowder and Lead,” ”Vice” features a softer, more sultry sound. The song is the first from Lambert’s still untitled sixth studio album.  Music fans have been speculating if Lambert will lyrically address her divorce from fellow country music star, Blake Shelton, on the project. Shelton sang about ”getting over her” on his single, ”Came Here To Forget,” which released in March. Since their split, Lambert has moved on with singer Anderson East, and Shelton has been dating pop star, Gwen Stefani.
