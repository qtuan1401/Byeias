On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Bloomberg Politics Managing Editor Mark Halperin predicted that at least one judge will lean on the precedent created by the decision not to indict Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her emails and say, “if Hillary Clinton can get off, other people can get off. ”  Halperin said, “What the FBI director did was quite extraordinary. He claimed he wanted to be open. He’s not answered questions from the media about what he did. He answered questions from Congress. And now it’s going to be up to a lot of federal judges to decide whether  —   and prosecutors, to decide whether precedents were set in this case, and I think there will be at least one judge who goes hard after this precedent, and basically says, if Hillary Clinton can get off, other people can get off. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
