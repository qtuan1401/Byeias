A warrant for the arrest of a man from Fayetteville, North Carolina, was issued last week after a woman said he was using his cell phone to film underneath her dress as she shopped at a local Target department store, court documents reveal. [Fayetteville police arrested Magrady Fredidando, 43, and charged him with felony secret peeping after the complaint was filed.  Court documents show that Fredidando was assessed a $3, 000, unsecured bond on Wednesday. According to the arrest report, the store’s loss prevention officer told police he saw Fredidando in the act of trying to take video up a shopper’s skirt. The suspect’s case is ongoing. Sadly, this is nothing new. A year ago, a man in Cincinnati was arrested for taking   video of two teen girls and was given a $7, 000 bond for his crime. Also last year, a judge in Oregon actually let a man accused of filming up a    girl’s dress off without a charge, saying the man’s harassment of women at Target was “appalling” but not a crime. In another case, an Orlando, Florida, man was arrested on two counts of video voyeurism for following women in a Target store in Waterford Lakes.
