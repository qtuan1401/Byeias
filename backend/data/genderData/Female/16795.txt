Wednesday after meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) held a press conference and emphasized the importance of turnout in next week’s Iowa contest.  Sanders said, “The president and I discussed this morning a number of issues, foreign policy issues, domestic issues, occasionally little bit of politics, but I enjoyed the meeting and I thought it was a very positive and constructive meeting. We are right now, as everybody knows, in a very tough campaign in Iowa, then we’re going to New Hampshire. I think what the Iowa campaign ends up being about is one word, and that is turnout. We’re feeling really good about where we are, and if there is a large voter turnout  —   now, I’m not saying we could do what Barack Obama did in 2008. I wish we could, but I don’t think we can. But if there is a large turnout, I think we win. ” “If not, I think we’re going to be struggling,” he continued. “Then we go to New Hampshire, and we’re going to fight as hard as we can for a week in New Hampshire, and I’m thinking we have a pretty good chance there. Then we’re going to Nevada and South Carolina. And by the way, I think we’re going to do a lot, lot better in those states than people think we are. And then we head off to Super Tuesday. We were just in Minnesota yesterday, had a phenomenal turnout in St. Paul. We had 15, 000 people out in St. Paul. We had 6, 000 people out in Duluth. We’re feeling pretty good. So, I think the American people, our working people, young people, want to see real movement in this country, and I think we are tapping into that energy, and I think we stand a very good chance to do well in Iowa and forward. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
