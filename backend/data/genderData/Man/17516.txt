Monday on CNN, former Obama White House official and CNN contributor Van Jones discussed the resurgence of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. According to Jones, the fact that Sanders remains viable in as a candidate shows there is a civil war within the Democratic Party.  “A civil war is breaking out in the Democratic Party,” Jones said. “This went from being, ‘Hey, you know, I don’t care about your emails, blah, blah, blah. We’re all going to play nice here.’ As this thing has gone on, what’s happened is Bernie Sanders should be out. In a normal situation, he would be out. Last month, he raised $  million. We’re in the middle of a second Sanders surge. And now both sides are getting frustrated with each other on everything. And so it shows up. It’s like a couple fighting over some total side issue. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
