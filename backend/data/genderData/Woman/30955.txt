A Florida school district is inviting parents to excuse their children from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. [“I understand my rights as a parent and I request that my child, noted above, be excused from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. This request includes standing and placing   right hand over   heart,” said the text of the form sent to parents.  Micah Brien uploaded a picture of his niece’s form to Facebook and said, “My niece brought this home from school today  …    What is happening to our country? !?” Brienen’s    gave the form to her daughter, but not without writing some choice words for the school on the form, according to WGHP: “This is the dumbest thing I have ever read and I am so ashamed of this. ” The post has been shared over 15, 000 times. Brienen followed up on his post a few days later asking his friends to vote against the superintendent of schools in the next election. A 2008 federal court ruling from the U. S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a student can’t be forced to state the pledge while others recite it and can, with a parent’s permission, be excused from reciting it. In 2016, the state legislature voted through a bill that allows schools  —   but does not require schools  —   to notify parents of a legal right to exempt their children from reciting the pledge, according to The Miami Herald.
