One of the most   white supremacist hubs on the web has declared that Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos is the “single greatest threat” that they have faced, and have declared a “holy crusade” in an attempt to take him down. [Andrew Anglin, editor of the Daily Stormer, published an article on the website this Tuesday that declares Milo is taking their “brand [and] symbols, and turning them against us for a   conservative agenda. He is rewriting our narrative, while taking everything that we have created” to supposedly use for his own ends.  Throughout the piece, Anglin brands Milo a “kike” due to his   ancestry. According to Anglin, this is supposedly proof that “the Jews” are trying to control the narrative of the right, an idea that has been pushed for centuries by   and white supremacists alike. His plan involves encouraging followers of his site to attend events on Milo’s Dangerous Faggot tour list, and “publicly confront” Milo about how he is apparently twisting their movement. “We are going to show his people that the real   exists and that we despise him, that the hoax   he’s created doesn’t exist. ” Anglin is a   “1488er” and an avowed white supremacist. In his latest call to arms against Milo, Anglin highlighted multiple Facebook users who defended Milo against the 1488ers, one of whom accused Anglin of being a “plant by the Clinton campaign. ” Another argued that “targeting gays like Milo only divides our movement! We need  …     to stick together, [because] they want us to infight!” One other attacked Anglin personally, saying that “anyone who fixates on Jews as much as he does is  …     crazy. ” Anglin dismissed these criticisms as made by “kikebots. ” Jack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.
