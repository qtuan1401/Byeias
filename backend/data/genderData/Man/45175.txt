But in fact, Houston told Shontell, it   wasn’t Dropbox he used to apply to the accelerator for its first   round in 2005  —   it was an   company Houston had started in   high school, which Y Combinator rejected. ” ”   He came back later with the idea for Dropbox, and along with   cofounder Arash Ferdowsi, ended up raising the company’s first   million in 2007. ” ’ ’ ’Drew Houston came up with the idea for Dropbox. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
