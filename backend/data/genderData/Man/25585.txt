JAFFA, Israel  —   A Bahraini court was asked to okay sex reassignment surgery for a man who claimed that his manhood was “extinguished” after his wife spilled boiling oil on his genitals. [The man, who is in his thirties, was attacked by his wife in a fit of jealousy after she suspected he cheated on her with a younger woman from the Philippines. The couple have two children.  He claimed that following the case his wives petitioned for divorce, citing his sexual impotence. He told the court he had started a sex reassignment procedure in Thailand. A lawyer who refused to represent the petitioner said that she turned down his plea because he was unable to provide an expert opinion that his sexual identity is ambiguous. “It is unclear whether he is undergoing a veritable identity crisis or this is a vengeful ploy to get back at his wives,” she said. Similarly, a Bahraini court rejected the petition to sanction gender reassignment for a woman who underwent an operation abroad and is in the process of becoming a man. However, the court said that according to a doctor’s report, she would never become a   man, and that “hormones and surgeries would never change her feminine chromosome structure. ” The petitioner, for her part, claims that she is in the midst of a grave sexual identity crisis and provided a religious ruling that permits sex reassignment in specific circumstances.
