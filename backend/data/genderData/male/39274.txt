 (CNN) If you bought Publix Premium pancake and waffle mixes lately, youâ€™re going to want to check the box. Publix Super Markets is issuing a recall for some of those products after the supplier said a milk powder used in the mix may contain salmonella. The mixes were sold at stores in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.   The recalled products include   boxes of Publix Premium   Chocolate Chip Pancake  Waffle Mix, Pumpkin Pancake  Waffle Mix and Blueberry Flavored Pancake  Waffle Mix.  No one has reported getting sick from the product, but exposure to salmonella can cause diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. The chain recalled the products out of an abundance of caution.  Most people who are exposed to the bacteria recover, even without treatment. For those with compromised immune systems, this kind of infection can be much more serious and require hospitalization. The elderly and infants also can have a hard time fighting off these infections.  The products have been pulled from store shelves, according to a Publix representative. However, if you have a box on your shelf, you can return it to the store where you bought it for a full refund.  If you have questions, call Publix Customer Care at    .
