Barca coach Luis Enrique was relieved to come away with victory    the 100th of his reign. ”We were finding it difficult to get the ball into the opposition’s half, but we were more in control of things in the second half, although it was them who created most pressure towards the end,” he told Barca’s website. ”It’s an invigorating result. It’s very hard to play at San Mames, so we’re really pleased with the outcome.” Get more soccer news at cnn.
