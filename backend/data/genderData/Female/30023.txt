Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly sent a warning to officials living abroad, telling them to bring their families home to the “motherland” in anticipation of a possible global war. [The UK Daily Mail relates the report published at Russia’s Znak. com, which said, “administration staff, regional administrators, lawmakers of all levels and employees of public corporations have been ordered to take their children out of foreign schools immediately. ”  Failure to comply with the order would supposedly damage the official’s chance to receive a promotion. Although no reason for the order was given, Russian political analysts portrayed it as a measure to “prepare elites for some big war. ” The Daily Mail notes the order was sent after “Putin cancelled a planned visit to France amid a furious row over Moscow’s role in the Syrian conflict and just days after it emerged the Kremlin had moved   missiles nearer to the Polish border. ” Further reporting comes from the Daily Star, which decided to mention World War III and illustrate the article with a picture of Putin glowering while a nuclear bomb goes off in the background: Russian politicians and officials with children studying in the West have been told to bring them home to the “Fatherland” local media is reporting. They have also been told to recall any older relatives  —   such as parents  —   living in foreign countries, sources claim. The worrying development  —   which comes after Putin suddenly cancelled a visit to France  —   applies to ALL state employees. Workers were reportedly told to pull their children out of school immediately, even if it was in the middle of term. The New York Post caught retired Russian Lt. General Evgeny Buzhinsky throwing a little trash talk at the BBC: “If you want a confrontation, you’ll get one. But it won’t be a confrontation that doesn’t harm the interests of the United States. You want a confrontation, you’ll get one everywhere. ”
