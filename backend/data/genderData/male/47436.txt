’  ’ ’   The Supreme Court  a surprise victory for supporters of affirmative   action on Thursday, ruling   in favor of     admissions.  ’ ’   The decision came as a surprise to many following the case.  ’ ’   The case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (UT) involves   a woman named Abigail Fisher who argued she was unfairly rejected   from the university because she is white. ’ ’   The university’’s policy automatically accepts students in the top   10% of their high school class and uses a ”holistic,”     policy to fill the rest of the incoming class. Fisher claimed she   would have been accepted if she had been a different race and   contends that the University of Texas’’ policy denied her equal   protection under the law.  ’ ’  ’ ’   And when it returned last year, the inevitably of a tie loomed.   Justice Elena Kagan recused herself, and Justice Antonin Scalia,   who deeply opposed affirmative action, would likely have sided   with the three reliably conservative justices    Roberts, Thomas,   and Alito   against Kennedy, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Ginsburg. Or,   Kennedy could have sided with the conservatives, and the court   would have ruled   against affirmative action.  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’ Harpalani said the Supreme Court’’s   decision just gives other colleges and universities a ”blueprint”   for how to justify their   admissions policies. ’ ’   ” ’ ’The Supreme Court delivered a surprise. ..’
