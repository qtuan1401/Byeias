ABC’s “The View”   Joy Behar argued that President Obama’s “color” “has something to do with” Senate Republicans vowing to block his Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday’s broadcast of “The View. ”  After saying that she thinks Obama will put a moderate nominee on the Supreme Court, “It’s almost like they’re [Senate Republicans] not being patriotic, it seems to me.   …     And I have to say it, I know it’s not popular to say it, but his color has something to do with it. I don’t care. ” She added, “I’m saying that they’re racists, and it takes a white person to say it. Because everybody knows black people believe that. ” (  NewsBusters) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
