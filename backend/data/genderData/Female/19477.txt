Actor Tony Goldwyn  —   best known for his role as President Fitzgerald Grant on ABC’s Scandal  —   introduced the Mothers of the Movement, a politically active group of mothers whose children were killed in   shootings in recent years, at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday evening. [“They understand we must reach out to each other because of our diversity, because we are stronger together,” Goldwyn told the cheering crowd of Democratic devotees in attendance at the convention.  “You know, Hillary says we can’t hide from these hard truths about race and justice in America. We have to name them and own them  —   and then change them. That’s what she’ll do as president,” the actor said.
