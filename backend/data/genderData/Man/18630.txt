While talking about the upcoming Tampa Bay Rays game against the Cuban national baseball team on the Tuesday broadcast of “Mike and Mike” on ESPN Radio, ESPN’s Dan Le Batard said the fact that an American baseball team went over to Cuba to play their national baseball team is actually a “win for the Cuban propaganda machine. ”  Speaking as the son of Cuban exiles, Le Batard stated, “Their baseball team has been a propaganda tool for a long time, winning gold medals, and this right here is a win for the Cuban national propaganda machine, the Americans playing a road game with the Cuban team. ” The game is set for Tuesday at 12:30 p. m. ET on ESPN. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
