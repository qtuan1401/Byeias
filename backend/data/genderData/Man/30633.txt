Both the victims and the alleged killers in the murder of three people in California were reportedly members of their local ‘furry’ community. [Last weekend, police were called to the scene by a    girl after her parents  —   Jennifer Yost, 39, and Christopher Yost, 34  —   as well as friend Arthur Boucher, 28, had been shot dead at the Yost’s home in Fullerton, California.  Two men, Frank Felix and Joshua Acosta, have been charged with the murders. However, it has now emerged that both the alleged killers and their victims were members of a local “furry” community, also known as Furry fandom, which involves dressing up as anthropomorphic animals as a hobby. Furry fandom also involves attending regular furry conventions for fans to show off their animal alter egos, with victim Katlynn Yost’s chosen species being a wolf, according to her Twitter.
