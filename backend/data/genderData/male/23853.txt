TEL AVIV  —   James Stavridis, who led the 2011 intervention in Libya as NATO’s 16th Supreme Allied Commander, used unusual terminology to express his hope that the United Arab Emirates would step up its involvement in the Libya war. [In an email forwarded to Hillary Clinton’s private server, Stavridis discussed a mission change that would put U. S. bombs on UAE aircraft for strikes in Libya.  “As to how long   …     inshallah, soon,” wrote Stravridis, a retired U. S. Navy admiral. The dispatch was contained in Monday’s batch of roughly 3, 900 pages said to be the last of Clinton’s   emails. The messages were reviewed in full by this reporter. Stravridis was replying to an email sent from one of Clinton’s top deputies, Jake Sullivan, to Ivo H. Daalder, the U. S. Permanent Representative on the NATO Council. “Any way to get the UAE suggestion that they will contribute aircraft for strike missions firmed up and announced by the SYG?” Sullivan asked. Daalder forwarded the query to Stravridis, asking, “Gather you and Clinton talked about this. When do you think they will be able to start?” Here is Stavridis’s full reply: What the UAE For Min said was they wanted US bombs so we’ll have to work that on DoD circuits (Centcom presumably) We’ll also go    via force gen, JFC Naples, and JTF and push them to use their own air to ground ordnance in the interim Suggest you guys work the political side up there, As to how long   …     inshallah, soon, Best, Jim Admiral, USN Supreme Allied Commander, Europe Commander, US European Command “Stronger Together” Inshallah is Arabic for “Allah willing” or “if Allah wills it. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
