Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would “look into” releasing the transcripts of the paid speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs and other groups during Thursday’s Democratic candidates debate on MSNBC.  Hillary was asked, “[A]re you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know, through reporting, that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In the  —   in full disclosure, would you release all of them?” She answered, “I will look into it. I don’t know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But I can only repeat what is the fact, that I spoke to a lot of different groups, with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members, about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described, more times than I can remember, how stressful it was advising the president about going after Bin Laden. So, my view on this is, look at my record. Look at what I am proposing, and we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. ” Hillary continued that she wants to deal with other examples of corporate excess, and that she has “a broader view. Now, if all we’re going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed, one street in our economy, we’re missing the big oil companies. We’re missing other big energy companies. We’re missing the big picture. And I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
