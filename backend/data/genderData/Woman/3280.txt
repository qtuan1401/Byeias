  percent of Americans say race relations are generally bad, one of the highest levels of discord since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles during the Rodney King case, according to the latest New York   News poll. The poll, conducted from Friday, the day after the killing of five Dallas police officers, until Tuesday, found that six in 10 Americans say race relations were growing worse, up from 38 percent a year ago. Racial discontent is at its highest point in the Obama presidency and at the same level as after the riots touched off by the 1992 acquittal of Los Angeles police officers charged in Mr. King’s beating. Relations between black Americans and the police have become so brittle that more than half of black people say they were not surprised by the attack that killed five police officers and wounded nine others in Dallas last week. Nearly half of white Americans say that they, too, were unsurprised by the episode, the survey found. Despite President Obama’s insistence at a memorial service for the fallen officers that the races in the United States are “not as divided as we seem,” the poll found that black and white Americans hold starkly different views on race, particularly regarding the treatment of   by the police. Asked whether the police in most communities are more likely to use deadly force against a black person than a white person,   of   answered yes, and only about half as many white people agree.   percent of whites said that the race of the suspect made no difference in the use of force only 18 percent of black Americans said so. When asked to rate the job their local police department was doing, four in five whites said excellent or good a majority of blacks answered fair or poor. More than   of black people say the police in their communities make them feel more anxious than safe. By wide margins, whites and Hispanics say the police make them feel safer. “I have been in situations where the police have made situations worse rather than better,” Ayesha Numan, 22, a black woman living in Kansas City, Mo. said in a   interview. “That’s not to say that I write them off as all bad. I just have to be cautious of how they’re acting around me. ” Mr. Obama on Tuesday spoke at a memorial service in Dallas honoring the officers killed when Micah Johnson, a    black Army veteran, opened fire at a protest last Thursday. Last week was among the most wrenching since the Black Lives Matter movement began three years ago: On    days, videos were released showing the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of the police, and the Dallas attack followed a day later. Black and white opinion is sharply divided on the aims and the approach of the Black Lives Matter movement. Seventy percent of   are sympathetic to the movement, compared with only 37 percent of whites. Among all Americans, 41 percent agree with the movement, 25 percent disagree and 29 percent do not have an opinion either way. Support for Black Lives Matter correlates directly to age, with 50 percent of all adults younger than 30 saying they agree with the movement, compared with 20 percent who disagree with it. Among those 45 and older, 36 percent agree and 29 percent disagree. “The Black Lives Matter movement has given a younger generation a voice in civil rights,” Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, said. “The police are a flash point. The broader situation is always the underlying issues: the criminal justice system being broken, the higher unemployment among   the slower recovery from the recession, the assault on voting rights and voter suppression. ” The nationwide   News Poll was conducted July 8 to 12 on cellphones and landlines with 1, 600 adults, including 171 black respondents and 1, 207 whites. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults, three points for whites and nine points for blacks.   percent of Americans have heard or read at least some news about the last week’s racially tinged violence  —   the shootings in Dallas and deaths of Mr. Castile and Mr. Sterling. Some feel skeptical of what they have seen and heard of police shootings. “A lot of the times you see video, and most of it’s after the altercation. You really don’t see what happens before that,” said Roger Boulanger, 46, who is white and lives in Mendon, Mass. He said that race relations were generally bad, but he did not perceive them as being worse recently. “I don’t want to say it’s 100 percent that every time someone gets shot, it’s just the police being racist,” he said. “I don’t think that. ”
