You don’t get to be ”shocked” anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons.  —   Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016,  MacFarlane did not mention that the   the gun used in Sunday morning’s shooting, is not an “automatic weapon. ” Rather, it is a semiautomatic firearm that fires one round  —   and only one round  —   every time the trigger is pulled. The same goes for the handgun Mateen was carrying as well. At least one Twitter user pointed that out to MacFarlane: @syedmahmood @SethMacFarlane An AR 15 is not an automatic weapon.  You can’t even get simple things right.  —   Travis Amo (@travis_john78) June 12, 2016,  MacFarlane also neglected to mention the numerous times that a concealed carry permit holder has thwarted a gunman in dangerous situations.
