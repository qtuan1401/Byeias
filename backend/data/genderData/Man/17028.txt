UNREAL. pic. twitter.  Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley turned an easy play into a highlight reel play Thursday against the Colorado Rockies.  Down   in the top of the fourth inning, Rockies pitcher Tyler Chatwood hit a weak grounder to Utley, who misplayed the ball. The ball bounced off Utley, but he quickly turned, grabbed the ball and tossed it backwards to first baseman Adrian Gonzalez without looking to get Chatwood out. The Dodgers came back to win the game  . Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
