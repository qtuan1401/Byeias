At Saturday night’s GOP Presidential  debates, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said that Republicans need to take a more aggressive stance in getting conservatives nominated to the Supreme Court and “fight and fight and fight” to get them though the nominating process. [Saying that he’s an “article two guy” who believes in a strong executive branch, Bush said he believes President Obama should nominate a “consensus” replacement for Supreme Court Justin Anton Scalia.  Bush said that Scalia’s replacement should be a “lover of liberty” who “believes in limited government” in the tradition of Scalia.
