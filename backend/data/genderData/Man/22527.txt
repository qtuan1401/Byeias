A    girl in Texas is being hailed a hero after she saved her mother from drowning in their backyard swimming pool, and it was caught on home surveillance video.  According to a report, Tracy Anderwald suffered a seizure last week while swimming. Her    daughter, Allison, then hopped in to save her. Allison can be seen in the video pulling her unconscious mother to the shallow end, making sure her head was above water before running inside the house for help. Tracy, who was released from the hospital Tuesday, was not seriously injured. She said her daughter learned to swim at the age of two, and she was surprised the young girl knew what to do in the situation. (  Fox LA) Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
