House Speaker Paul Ryan signals his support for the United Kingdom, after the country’s voters passed a referendum to leave the European Union. [“As an American, we value the principle of sovereignty,   government by consent and limited government,” Ryan said during a press conference today. “These are very important principles and these principles are being expressed here at home and around the world. We clearly understand the thinking behind these principles. ”  Ryan did not celebrate passage of the referendum, but reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to sustain the special relationship with Britain. “Our friends in the United Kingdom are our indispensable ally and this is a very special relationship and that relationship is going to continue no matter what. Period. End of story,” he said. He dismissed the volatile reaction by the stock markets around the world, assuring Americans that they would stabilize. “Obviously markets are going to react when new news and information like this occurs. I believe that markets will eventually stabilize,” he said. Ryan indicated that the tax reform plan released by House Republicans today would help America lead the world economy. “For all of these moments of possible uncertainty that are happening around the globe, having strong powerful confident American economic leadership is in need, and this does that,” he said. Earlier in the day, Ryan released a statement noting that he respected the decision made by British voters. “I respect the decision made by the people of the United Kingdom,” he said. “The UK is an indispensable ally of the United States, and that special relationship is unaffected by this vote. ”
