A shopper in Tulalip, WA captured video of a Nike outlet store towards the end of the chaos that can be Black Friday shopping.  “It looked like an earthquake just rocked the place,” Larry Downer told ABC. In the video, taken at 8:30 p. m. the store is a sea of Nike boxes and shoes thrown all over the place. Customers are seen stepping on boxes because they cover the majority of the floor.
