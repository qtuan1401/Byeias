On this weekend’s broadcast of “CBS Sunday Morning,” Fox News Channel host Bill O’Reilly discussed his “Killing” series of books and what he attributed to their success. But as CBS’s Mo Rocca pointed out, they haven’t been without controversy.  Rocca referred to one encounter O’Reilly had with Washington Post columnist George Will, a fellow Fox News contributor, last November about his “Killing Reagan” book. According to O’Reilly, he “destroyed” Will in that exchange. Partial transcript as follows: ROCCA: The way you called George Will a hack like he was h —   . That “h”  —   I mean, you really dug in on it. How did you feel about that confrontation? O’REILLY: It was an honest confrontation   …     He didn’t have anything. He had nothing. I destroyed him.
