WATCH: FBI debunks Hillary Clinton’s email claims https:  .  A montage broadcast on Wednesday’s edition of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” laid out the instances where the FBI contradicted claims made by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  The montage included Clinton stating on March 10, 2015, “I thought it would be easier to carry one device. ” Which was contrasted with FBI Director James Comey saying the day before that Clinton “used numerous mobile devices to send and to read email. ” The video then contrasted Clinton saying, “We went through a thorough process to identify all my   emails. ” With Comey’s statement that “The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton, in 2014, did not individually read the content of all of her emails. ” And that it was “highly likely that their search missed some   emails. ” In addition, Clinton’s claims that the emails “were immediately captured and preserved. ” Was contradicted by Comey’s statement that “There was no archiving at all of her emails. ” Clinton’s claims that “There were no security breaches. ” And that there were no classified materials. Were also contradicted by Comey’s declarations that “It is possible that hostile actors gained access. ” And “110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. ” A clip of Clinton stating that she “did not send classified material. ” Was also contrasted with Comey saying “Even if information is not marked classified in an email, participants who know, or should know, that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
