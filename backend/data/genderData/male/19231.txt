The suspect behind the Ohio State University attack posted to Facebook decrying America, saying, “We will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims,” just moments before the attack. [Abdul Razak Ali Artan reportedly attacked students at Ohio State University with a knife and car, leading to 11 people being hospitalised for injuries on Monday. Shortly after Artan’s identity was revealed, many people began researching his background, discovering that he was a Somalian refugee that had come to the university to study.  ABC News reports that Artan posted to Facebook just minutes before the attack, saying, “I can’t take it anymore. America! Stop interfering with other countries, especially the Muslim Ummah. We are not weak. We are not weak, remember that. ” He also mentioned the recent trend of “lone wolf” attacks carried out by sole Islamic terrorists. “If you want us Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace,” the post reads. “We will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims. ” The post also mentions by name Anwar   an     cleric killed in 2011 who Artan describes as a “hero. ” Artan was shot and killed at Ohio State University by police, ending the rampage.
