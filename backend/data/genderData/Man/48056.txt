’  ’ ’   Apple is starting to make more noise about the power of its   App Store as it begins to rely on its services business more   heavily for revenue growth. ’ ”   Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of internet services, even tried to take   credit for Uber in an recent interview.  ” ’   ”I think it’s awesome that Travis and his team have done Uber on   our platform.
