Tickets have now been partially released for the second leg of Milo Yiannopoulos’ Dangerous Faggot Tour. Organisers of Milo’s upcoming speeches at Clemson University and UC Irvine are currently allowing prospective attendees to purchase spots at the hotly anticipated events. [It seems that just like the first leg, this next run of talks will be just as controversial. There have already been moves to ban Milo at Clemson, with angry leftists labelling the   group who invited him as “garbage. ” Meanwhile at UC Irvine, administrators have attempted to torpedo the planned rally, citing possible “security concerns. ”  Hosted by We Roar and Turning Point USA, Milo’s talk at Clemson will be called “Make Clemson Great Again. ” It will take place on October 18th, Milo’s birthday and the 2nd annual World Patriarchy Day, running from 7PM to 9PM. Tickets are $4. 18 and can be purchased here. The UC Irvine event will be held at the Crystal Cove auditorium. Starting at 2PM on October 30th, the event is expected to finish at 4PM that afternoon. Tickets are free and can be found here. Jack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech. You can email him at jack@yiannopoulos. net.
