(Reuters)  —   The widow of an American killed in a shooting attack at a Jordanian police training center has sued Twitter Inc, blaming the social media company for making it easier for Islamic State to spread its message. [Tamara Fields, a Florida woman whose husband Lloyd died in the Nov. 9 attack, accused Twitter of having knowingly let the,  militant Islamist group use its network to spread propaganda, raise money and attract recruits. She said the San   company had until recently given Islamic State an “unfettered” ability to maintain official Twitter accounts. “Without Twitter, the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the   terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” according to the complaint filed on Wednesday in the federal court in Oakland, California.
