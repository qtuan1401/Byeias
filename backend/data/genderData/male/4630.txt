A leading bank regulator on Friday reversed course and revoked Wells Fargo’s right to shield the pay of former executives after a   scandal. The regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, also said Wells Fargo must now seek advance approval before naming new bank leadership. Wells Fargo in September agreed to pay $185 million to settle charges that bank employees opened as many as two million accounts banking and credit card without customers’ knowledge. The agency, the main regulator for federal banks, exempted Wells Fargo from some controls on “golden parachutes” in that settlement. The move Friday evening voids those earlier allowances, the agency said. The bank was notified on Friday that the agency had revoked “relief from specific requirements and limitations regarding rules, policies, and procedures for corporate activities,” the comptroller’s office said in a statement on Friday. An official of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the move put Wells Fargo under toughened standards for oversight which the agency had exempted in the original settlement. John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo’s former  chief executive, and Carrie Tolstedt, former head of retail banking, have relinquished about $60 million in stock after the scandal, according to a Reuters review of securities filings. But the pair also stood to take home more than $350 million in compensation, according to filings.
