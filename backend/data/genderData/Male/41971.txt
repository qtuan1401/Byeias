Washington (CNN) Martin O’Malley says Wall Street would accept either Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush as president    but wouldn’t be happy if the former Maryland governor won. A day after the former Maryland governor and Baltimore mayor officially launched his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination with tough   Street rhetoric, he lumped both Clinton and Bush together in an interview Sunday on ABC’s ”This Week.”   ”What we need new leadership to accomplish is to actually rein in excesses on Wall Street,” he said, making reference to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

He made a pitch for himself that also offered a glimpse at one of his biggest challenges in taking on the universally known Clinton as a largely unknown challenger: Wealthy donors might be hard to find.  ”I am not beholden to Wall Street interests,” O’Malley said. ”There are not Wall Street CEOs banging down my door and trying to participate or help my campaign.” O’Malley is a   for the Democratic nomination at this point, barely registering in the polls. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is Clinton’s   challenger, notching around 15% support in recent surveys.
