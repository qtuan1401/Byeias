Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) told reporters that allegations Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with Russian officials was “completely different” from former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s secret meeting with Bill Clinton during the 2016 election.  “[T]here couldn’t be a starker difference,” Pelosi said. “Attorney General Lynch had a social encounter, serendipitous, some might say, that the former president of the United States came by to say hello and they discussed their grandchildren. ” “She did not have a major role in the Hillary Clinton campaign. This is a completely different thing. The reason we have been saying that the Attorney General Sessions should step aside and maybe should never have been confirmed is because he was a surrogate,” she continued. Pelosi later called the two situations “completely different, day and night. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
