Today in Baghdad, tomorrow in Jerusalem and Palestine with Allah’s help. ” “Our Caliph Abu Bakr   made it clear, and repeated the words of our [military] commander Abu Mohammed  : Today in Baghdad, tomorrow in Jerusalem,” wrote Eladnani the Grandson, an Iraqi IS member. “Look at Iran and the Jews’ cronies bearing a humiliating defeat. Tomorrow, with Allah’s help, we’ll be in Palestine. Allah promised it and it will happen. ” In the closed chat group, which utilizes the encrypted Telegram messaging service, top IS operative Abu Bakr Almuhager added: “My brothers, we’ve made a vow to Allah that the Jews will not take pleasure in occupying the holy land of Palestine.   …     Our brothers hit the infidels in the safety of their quarters in Baghdad, despite the ongoing war against us, and chased away the American officers. Our next meeting will be in Palestine, or Washington, or wherever, until the sacred caliphate rules the world. ”
