The narrator hails the terrorists responsible for the murder as “heroes” and heaps further praise on them for executing the couple in front of their young children, while leaving the children themselves unharmed. Israeli investigators said the terrorists would likely have continued their massacre had the parents not put up a struggle, which caused one of the gunmen to accidentally shoot his accomplice in the hand, prompting both attackers to flee the scene, Arutz 7 reported.
