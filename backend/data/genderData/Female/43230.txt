’   President Barack Obama on Thursday awarded Vice President Joe   Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest US civilian   honor, in a surprise ceremony at the White House. ’ ’   During a speech paying tribute to the vice president, Obama   announced he would award the final medal of his presidency to the   vice president. That elicited audible gasps from the crowd and   caused an emotional, tearful Biden to turn away. ’ ’   ”Joe, for your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of   country, and for your lifetime of service that will endure   through the generations, I’’d like to ask the military aide to   join us onstage,” Obama said before presenting the award. ’ ’ ’ ”   Obama praised Biden’s long career in the Senate, as well as his   work on issues like curbing domestic violence and sexual assault,   on foreign policy, and on a campaign to cure cancer in the wake   of the death of his son Beau, the former Delaware attorney   general, in 2015. ” ’   Choking up and becoming tearful at several points, Biden said he   had ”no inkling” he would be receiving the medal, and he praised   Obama for allowing him to take a lead role on many key issues. ’ ’’ ’   ”I’’ve also leaned on you and a lot of people in this room,” Biden   said. ’ ’   ”Mr. President, you have more than kept your commitment to me by   saying that you wanted me to help govern,” Biden said. ”Every   single thing you’’ve asked me to do, Mr. President, you have   trusted me to do. And that’’s a remarkable thing. I don’’t think   . .. that kind of relationship has existed.” ’ ’   Obama and Biden’’s close personal relationship has been well   documented, even becoming an internet meme. Obama alluded to that   when he called their relationship a ”bromance” during the   ceremony. ’
