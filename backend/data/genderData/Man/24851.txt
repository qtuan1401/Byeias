From Ace of Spades:  It’s a pretty sad day when Joy Reid of MSNBC makes more sense to me than National Review. Check out her diagnosis (which mostly comes from moderate Republican turned liberalish independent Bruce Bartlett) at 6:45. It’s accurate  —   the   has been selling lies to everyone outside the donor class for years. They use their power to enact their own priorities into law, while telling the rest of us “it’s too hard” or “it will scare the moderates. ” And for years we went along with this. Well, as she notes, the issue of immigration has caused this bargain  —   the elites get their actual agenda, everyone else gets lies and empty promises  —   to break down, probably forever. You know, for years, I felt it was my duty to sell these shit sandwiches to readers for the Greater Good of winning elections. I didn’t like doing it, but I thought that, for example, the War on Terror was too important to risk a rupture over other questions. Although I’ve come to hate politics and I just despise reading the news now, the one good thing is that I’m liberated from splashing some ketchup on Sandwiches Made of Actual Shit and trying to sell them to people as tasty and healthful. I feel liberated. I serve no “Greater Good,” as I don’t know that there’s a Greater Good to be served anymore. So I can just say exactly what I think. And what I think is that the establishment has to be destroyed. We will not be ignored, we will not be condescended to, we will no longer accept broken promises and lies as our payment for our service to the GOP. And if it requires destroying the GOP and electing a Democrat to teach the establishment this lesson, to chastise them and to humble them, then we shall do just that, and do so happily. You will either come to terms, or you will be destroyed. Read more at Ace of Spades HQ.
