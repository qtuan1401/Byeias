A sample of students at Georgetown University who support Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the presidency couldn’t name a single accomplishment she did in her career as Secretary of State, senator, and First Lady of the United States.[  Campus Reform interviewed several Clinton supporters at Georgetown University who agreed with a Fox News poll that said a majority of Americans view Hillary Clinton as a role model. But when asked what accomplishments or experiences stood out to them that made her a role model, the students could not name a single accomplishment. “No, I cannot think of something off the top of my head,” responded one student, while another added “I wish I had a good answer for that honestly  …     I don’t. ” Another student responded, “I can’t think of anything. ” When pressed further, one student responded, “Not necessarily, just the fact that she’s a female” makes her qualified for the presidency. Another student when pressed further pointed to her years of government experience, saying, “the fact that she’s worked in government before says a lot, and makes her qualified. ” Yet another student said after being pressed further, that she’s qualified because “she’s morphed her political views into what the majority of the country wants. ” The video has been shared almost 2, 000 times on social media.
