Hillary Clinton’s advisers were concerned about the level of enthusiasm for her campaign as they approached the South Carolina primary against Bernie Sanders in May of 2015, according to the latest Wikileaks release of emails from campaign chairman John Podesta’s accounts. [Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton adviser, emailed Podesta to warn him about reports of Hillary Clinton’s   events, suggesting that it could have a negative effect on the campaign.  “That excitement thing you were worried about does seem to be a problem. She does need to rev it up,” she wrote, citing empty seats at South Carolina events events and closed offices. “Closed but for Glenn Thrush,” joked Podesta, referring to a Politico story by Thrush  —   who reported stopping at a Clinton office only to find it locked. “Reporters definitely buzzing,” Tanden replied. “But nothing that an event or two can’t fix. ” The pair shifted to idle gossip, as Tanden joked that Sidney Blumenthal was “the gift that keeps giving!” She was likely discussing the glut of reports featuring Blumenthal’s emails to Hillary Clinton about Libya and Benghazi. “It always amazes me that people like Sid either completely lack self awareness or self respect,” Podesta replied. “Maybe both. Will you promise to shoot me if I ever end up like that?”
