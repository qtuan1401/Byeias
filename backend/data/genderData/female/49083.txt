’  ’ ’   Police who were the first to respond to the massacre at the Pulse   Nightclub in Orlando this June are still haunted by what they   saw. ’ ’   If Officer Omar Delgado hears a particular ring tone, he  it instantly transports him back to   that night. ’ ’   Gerry Realin, another policeman who responded to the scene, is   still experiencing similar symptoms of   stress   disorder. ’ ’   ”The man who went to Pulse that day is not the same one who came   home,” his wife, Jessica Realin, told the Times. ”He shuts down,   turns a different color; his breathing changes.” ’ ’   The police were locked in a standoff with shooter Omar Mateen for   hours, who killed 49 people that night before officers finally   shot him down. ’ ’ ’ ”   Frances Robles writes for The Times that while victims of mass   shootings often receive compensation to deal with the tragedy,   first responders don’t usually get the same treatment. Both   Delgado and Realin are struggling to pay their bills,   particularly the ones piling up for therapy and mental health   treatment. ” ’   ”Anyone who has requested any type of assistance during this   process has received unconditional assistance from the city of   Orlando and the Orlando Police Department,” Orlando’’s deputy   police chief, Orlando Rolon, told the Times. ’ ’   Delgado and Realin each have GoFundMe pages set up to help them   out: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’   ”I still have some sick time left and some vacation time left,”   Delgado said. ”If I have to use that, so be it, but there’’s going   to come a point in time that that is going to stop.” ’
