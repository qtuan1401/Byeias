’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   But this year, buzz has been quiet. And rumors of potential   megadeals have been virtually nonexistent. ’ ”   At a time when airlines are experiencing great profitability and   with air travel expanding rapidly, it looks like sales of Airbus’   and Boeing’s next generation of airliners are facing two   significant headwinds.  ” ”   The airline industry is a         business. Airlines try to do whatever they can to cut   costs. Generally, that means saving on their most significant   expense  —   fuel. With     aerodynamics and        turbofan engines, Airbus and   Boeing’s next generation jets, such as the A320neo and the 737MAX   offer airlines a way to do this. ” ’   However, they also require the airlines to make a significant   financial commitment.  ’ ”   Boeing’s most affordable   jet  —   the 737MAX 7  —     carries a list price of $90 million, while the           lists at $400 million. Airbus’   A319neo   comes with a $98. 5 million sticker price, while the         jet $355. 7 million.  ” ’   Even with significant   discounts common in major   orders, the investment for an airline still runs in the billions   of dollars.  ’ ”   Unfortunately for airplane makers, at just over $46 a barrel, oil   is the cheapest it’s been in years. All of the sudden, Airbus and   Boeing’s most important customers are reporting 40% to 50%   reductions in fuel costs  —   much more than the roughly 20%   improvement its planes could deliver.  ” ’  ’ ’   As a result, customers are shying away from booking new orders   for the pricey, but more efficient jets. Instead, airlines are   gravitating t0 less efficient, but more       jets: the Boeing 737NG and the Airbus   A330.  ’ ”   Last month, Southwest Airlines, the Boeing 737’s largest and most   important customer, pushed back the delivery of 67 737MAX jets by   as long as six years  —   allowing the airline to delay . At the same time,   Southwest bumped up the delivery date of six       from 2018 to 2017.  ” ”   Although Southwest will remain the 737MAX’s launch customer when   it enters service next year, the airline’s decision is indicative   of the hurdles   face. ” ’   ” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   As a result, Airbus now has a   backlog, while   Boeing’s backlog currently sits at 5, 693 planes. Even with Airbus   and Boeing delivering a   635 and 762 planes   respectively in 2015, customers will have to wait on their   orders. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
