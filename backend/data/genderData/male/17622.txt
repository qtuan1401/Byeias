At a recent hearing in Olympia, Seattle Seahawks receiver Doug Baldwin spoke in favor of new rules that would remove some legal protections from police officers to open them to more prosecutions for doing their jobs, a report says. [The player was part of a   group that spoke before a meeting of the Joint Legislative Task Force on Use of Deadly Force in Community Policing held in the Washington state capitol building on November 21, according to USA Today.  Baldwin, who for some time has been an activist on police issues, demanded that the state legislature remove protections meant to shield police from malicious prosecution over accusations of deadly force. The player also wanted more funding for training Evergreen State police officers. This is far from the first time Baldwin has demanded more funding for police training. Early in October the player demanded a national movement to train officers in all fifty states. The wide receiver who enjoys a $13 million  contract, also recently blamed crime in the African American community on “slavery” in a conversation with Dan Leberfeld of Breitbart Sports. In fact, Baldwin excused away crime in black communities because slavery was “only” eliminated 150 years ago. Telling people not to get too worried about crime, Baldwin excused it away, saying, “     years Africans were enslaved, it’s only been 150 years since slavery was abolished. It’s going to take some time. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.
