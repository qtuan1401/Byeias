Former Speaker of the House and current Democrat minority leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) warned House Democrats to change their cellphone numbers after a Russian hacker released members’ personal information on Friday. Pelosi also revealed that she received dozens of “sick” and “obscene” phone calls due to the hack. [Pelosi insisted that Democrats have been the victims of “an electronic Watergate  ” after the personal information was released by hacker Giuccifer 2. 0 late on Friday.  Being called a “hacker horror,” the personal contact information for every House Democrat and many of their aides and office workers was released, including that of the minority leader herself. Pelosi had just landed in California on Saturday after a trip to Florida and when she got home was confronted with a series of mean spirited messages, Pelosi said according to the Daily Mail. “Upon landing, I have received scores of mostly obscene and sick calls, voicemails and text messages,” the Democrat leader told her fellows. “Please be careful not to allow your children or family members to answer your phone or read incoming text messages. This morning, I am changing my phone number and I advise you to do so as well. ” Pelosi said the hack of personal information was “a sad course of events” for her party but “more importantly for our country. ” The latest hack is just one of many such hacks of information. Just prior to the Democrat National Convention the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, released a batch of emails so damaging that the chairperson of the Democrat National Committee, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, was forced to resign even as her Party’s convention was about to start. There have been other consequences of the hack. The day after the release of the hacked information, Twitter suspended the account of Guccifer 2. 0.
