’China matters.’ ”The world’s   economy is obviously slowing. Official data would have markets believe it will growing at something like a 6. 5% pace this year. Others would challenge this assertion. ” ’But as  and investors in the US and Europe see stocks in their home markets follow suit, a series of statistics arguing that China ”doesn’’t matter” to the US economy (or something to that effect) have been thrown around. ’ ”And in a weekend note to clients, Deutsche Bank strategist Oleg Melentyev makes clear that he’s heard enough of this. ” ’”Aside from it sounding plain ignorant, to say that the health of   economy is irrelevant to the   this view also turns a blind eye to how the modern economy works. ”’ ’The basic idea is that while trade data and other things might capture the ”official impact” of how China and the US are intertwined, the   interactions all kinds of US firms and industries have with the Chinese economy are harder to measure and far more important than most people acknowledge or realize.’ ’Melentyev again:’ ”Elsewhere in his note, Melentyev notes that the People’s Bank of China  —   or China’s central bank  —   has cut rates six times over the last year in response to what the data says is a 0. 5% slowdown in the country’s GDP. ” ”Back in   China’s economic output was cut in half, and while the PBoC rate cut was of roughly the same magnitude, the current response to what the data might otherwise indicate is certainly more forceful. ” ’The question, then, is who knows what. And considering that China’’s record  —   as Melentyev notes  —   does not indicate they are adept at being ”ahead of the curve”  —   or acting before markets and the economy really force their hand  —   it seems something big is happening.  ’ ’’ ’ ’
