 (CNN) The National Archives on Friday released more than 350    photos of the Bush administration during the   attacks. The photos, which, according to The Boston Globe, were released as part of a Freedom of Information Act request from a PBS documentarian, focus on the reaction from   President Dick Cheney and other Bush administration officials during the terrorist attacks. Photos show members of the Bush administration talking in the President’s Emergency Operations Center beneath the White House, Cheney watching the attacks from a TV in his office, and Cheney heading to Camp David on Marine Two with his wife, Lynne.

Bush,   lady Laura Bush,   of State Colin Powell and   Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice can also be seen in the photos. Friday’s release was the second batch of photos centering on Cheney released in the last two weeks by the National Archives in response to PBS’s request. More than 2, 000 showing him during his eight years as vice president were released last month. All of the photos are available in a National Archives Flickr album.
