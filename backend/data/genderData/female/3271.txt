The markets reached another milestone on Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high. The broader Standard  Poor’s   index, a widely used benchmark for index funds, added to the record high it set on Monday. Both indexes have eclipsed peaks set in May 2015. The Dow, which is made up of just 30 stocks, is an older and   barometer of the market, but professional investors generally pay closer attention to the S. P. 500. The Dow rose 120. 74 points, or 0. 7 percent, to 18, 347. 67. That is 35 points higher than its previous record on May 19, 2015. The S. P. 500 gained 14. 98 points, or 0. 7 percent, to 2, 152. 14. The Nasdaq composite rose 34. 18 points, or 0. 7 percent, to 5, 022. 82. The Dow and S. P. 500 are each up 5. 3 percent for 2016, having roared back after a big drop in January and early February. The S. P. has soared 17. 7 percent since reaching a low of the year of 1, 829 on Feb. 11. The Nasdaq still lags the other two main United States stock market indexes. But the index, which is heavily weighted with technology and biotech stocks, erased its losses for the year on Tuesday. Investors continued to show an appetite for taking on risk. The biggest gainers included materials companies, banks and energy companies, which have been benefiting from a recovery in the price of oil. Financial companies, which have lagged the market this year, have been rising in recent days as   interest rates move higher in the bond market. Higher rates mean banks can make more money from lending. Citigroup gained $1. 15, or 2. 7 percent, to $43. 44. Despite recent increases, however, bond yields remain near historical lows, a worrisome sign to many analysts. Just last week, the yield on the   Treasury note touched a record low. “I wish we can be celebrating, but it’s a little disconcerting,” said Rob Bartenstein, chief executive of Kestra Private Wealth Services. “You’ve got government bonds at historical lows and equity markets at historical highs. That’s not something you see at the same time. ” He added: “I feel underinvested, but I’m not willing to chase stocks. ” Sectors that investors tend to favor when they’re nervous  —   including utilities, phone companies and makers of consumer staples  —   all fell as investors moved money out of   assets. Bond prices also fell sharply, sending yields higher. Shares of AMC Entertainment, the owner of the AMC theater chain, were up 7 percent after it said it would buy the European movie theater operator Odeon  UCI Cinemas Group from private equity firm Terra Firma in a deal valued at about 921 million pounds, or $1. 22 billion. AMC said the transaction would make it the biggest movie theater operator in the world. Seagate Technology surged $5. 26, or 21. 8 percent, to $29. 35 after forecasting strong sales. It also announced it would cut 6, 500 jobs, about 14 percent of its total work force. Benchmark United States crude added $2. 04 to close at $46. 80 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a standard for international oil prices, rose $2. 22 to $48. 17 a barrel in London. In other energy trading in New York, wholesale gasoline rose 5 cents, to $1. 43 a gallon heating oil rose 5 cents, to $1. 46 a gallon and natural gas rose 3 cents, to $2. 73 per 1, 000 cubic feet. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index jumped 2. 5 percent, a day after soaring 4 percent. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised new government spending to help jolt Asia’s   economy back to life now that his Liberal Democratic Party has won in parliamentary elections. Investors are betting that he will keep flooding the market with money by expanding bond purchases. The Kospi in South Korea edged up 0. 1 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1. 7 percent. In Europe, the CAC 40 in France rose 1. 6 percent, and the DAX in Germany added 1. 3 percent. The British FTSE 100 was flat. Shares of Nintendo jumped 12. 8 percent in Tokyo, fueled by the craze for Pokémon Go, a smartphone game that has become the   app in the Apple Store less than a week after its release in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. United States government bond prices fell. The yield on the   Treasury note rose to 1. 51 percent from 1. 43 percent.
