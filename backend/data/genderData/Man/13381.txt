Well, New York Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas can’t say he didn’t see this one coming, because he pretty much did. [While attending a wedding in the Dominican Republic, Casillas posted a picture of himself on Instagram, sitting atop an ATV and holding what he claims was a rolled cigar in his hand. Even as Casillas posted the image, he realized how this picture could look suspicious to his employer, and possibly end badly for him.  Casillas posted: Hand rolled Dominican cigar and ATV’s  …     great combination!! #iknowitlookslikeablunt #andIprobablyshouldnthavepostedthis #butthepicsolit #shoutouttotheshooter @6fo, A post shared by jade_52 (@jade_52) on Apr 8, 2017 at 10:09am PDT,  As prophesized, the next day Casillas received a text from the league letting him know that he had been “randomly” selected by the NFL for drug testing. Random lol, what a coincidence (see previous post) ‍♂️ A post shared by jade_52 (@jade_52) on Apr 9, 2017 at 4:35pm PDT,  According to ESPN, “Casillas posted an Instagram story on Monday that showed him getting ready to take what appeared to be a drug test. He shrugged his head with the caption, ‘For ya that thought it was photoshopped’ on the screen. ” In truth, Casillas’ story is very believable. The Dominican is kind of famous for their cigars. Also true, is that posting pic of what could easily pass for a blunt on Instagram is incredibly dumb. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
