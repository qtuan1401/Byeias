A new Reuters report reveals that the Swedish fundraising arm of the embattled Clinton Foundation failed to disclose the identity of donors who funneled millions of dollars in donations to the charity, despite Hillary Clinton’s promise to do so. [The admitted failure in transparency came along with news Friday that the Bill, Hillary  Chelsea Clinton Foundation will shut down all of its fundraising affiliates in Sweden and the United Kingdom should Clinton win the White House in November.  “The foundation’s outpost in Stockholm has received nearly 270 million Swedish crowns, about $30 million, since it was established in 2011, while Clinton was still secretary of state,” Reuters reports. “Most of this money was given by the Swedish Postcode Lottery and the Dutch Postcode Lottery, according to the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse’s website. ” However, some $6 million came from donors, the report continued, “that are not disclosed by the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse. Cookstra said those donors were included in the donor list published on the main Clinton Foundation’s website but declined to identify them or say why they were donating in Sweden rather than the United States. ” Friday’s news comes amid new reporting on allegations that Hillary Clinton used her position as Secretary of State to sell access to major Clinton Foundation donors. Last month, Bill Clinton promised that he will resign from the Clinton Foundation board if Hillary Clinton wins the White House in November. The chronic reports of    at the Clinton’s troubled charity have taken a toll on the Democratic presidential nominee’s poll numbers. Now, a majority of Americans say Bill and Hillary Clinton failed to avoid conflicts of interest as millions of dollars flowed into their corrupt family foundation.
