GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz announced endorsements from more than 100 Missouri and Florida pastors and faith leaders on Monday, just ahead of Tuesday’s primary elections contests. [The Cruz campaign touted the endorsements as evidence of the “grassroots army coalescing behind Cruz. ” New endorsements in Florida come from “a wide range of regions throughout the Sunshine State from the Panhandle, to northeast Florida, down to central and south Florida,” the campaign stated.  Cruz will hold rallies in five Illinois cities on Monday while his wife Heidi makes three stops in North Carolina. The campaign has targeted large segments of what many refer to as the faith community. The senator’s last stop of the day will be at the iWorship Center in Springfield. Heidi Cruz was scheduled for a stop at   Baptist Church in Conover, North Carolina. Republican primary voters in five states will decide on Tuesday which candidate to support. That includes Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio. In Missouri, Cruz added 25 new endorsements to add to ten previously announced Missouri pastor and faith leader endorsements. “Heidi and I are grateful for the prayers and support of these faithful men and women,” Cruz said following the endorsements.
