Paul Gosar ( ) says he has endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) for president. [“I am endorsing Sen. Cruz because I have worked with him in the trenches, fought battles with him on the Hill, and he has proven himself to be honorable, tough, and a man of his word,” Gosar said in a statement.  “He votes the way he says he will vote. He backs his words with action. I respect that and for that reason I think he will make a great President. ” Gosar has been one of the few members of Congress who has fought for conservative values in Washington. With the help of other conservative leaders, Gosar worked to oust former House Speaker John Boehner. He has also been a vocal critic of President Obama’s immigration policies and the Obama administration’s botched Fast and Furious operation. “I am thrilled to have Paul’s support,” said Cruz. “He has been a fighter for the people of Arizona and worked hard defending the issues important to conservatives like stopping illegal immigration and fighting President Obama’s lawless executive actions. We can work together to turn this country around in 2016. ”
