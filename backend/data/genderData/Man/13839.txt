Monday at Stanford Law School, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she “would like to change,” the Electoral College system.  Ginsburg said, “There are some things I would like to change, one is the Electoral College. ” She added, “But that would require a constitutional amendment, and amending our Constitution is powerfully hard to do. ” Ginsburg also bemoaned partisanship in Washington D. C. saying. “I wish there were a way I could wave a magic wand and put it back when people were respectful of each other and the Congress was working for the good of the country and not just along party lines. ” (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
