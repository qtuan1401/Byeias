On Thursday’s broadcast of “CNN Newsroom,”   NAACP President Minister Corine Mack argued that “it doesn’t really matter” if Keith Lamont Scott had a gun when he was shot by police.  Mack said that the police should release video of the Scott incident. She added, “At the end of the day, you know, a video may show a different perspective, depending on the angle, and so it will have many different angles. You may not get the full picture. I think the most important part is the contrast in him having a book versus a gun, but in my mind, and in most of the community’s mind, it really doesn’t matter if he had a gun. At the end of the day we have the right under the Second Amendment to carry here in North Carolina. And their responsibility was to engage him in a more   way, to find out if he had a permit for his gun, and allow him to go on his merry way, and he would still be living today. That’s not what happened. And so, I don’t want anyone to walk away from this conversation today thinking that a video showing he had a gun in any way says that he was guilty of anything. ” Mack further stated, “We had a case just recently, where, the gun  —   the gunman actually shot cops. He was brought down. It was disengaged  —   he was    . He was allowed to live. And all we’re asking for is the same treatment. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
