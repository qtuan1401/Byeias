Actress and Fox News contributor Stacey Dash says it’s “ludicrous” for black entertainers to call for a boycott of the Oscars for not nominating black performers while simultaneously supporting the BET and NAACP Awards which only recognize black artists. [“I think it’s ludicrous. We have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration,” Dash said Wednesday on Fox and Friends.   “If we don’t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NCAAP] Image Awards where you’re only awarded if you’re black. If it were the other way around, we’d be up in arms. ” Since last week’s release of the 88th Academy Award nominees, calls for a boycott have come from filmmaker Spike Lee, actress Jada Pinkett Smith, and documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, among others. Al Sharpton is leading the charge behind a nationwide boycott of the show. “It’s a double standard,” Dash added. “Just like there shouldn’t be a black history month. We’re Americans, period. ” See Stacey Dash’s comment in their entirety in the clip below.  Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.
