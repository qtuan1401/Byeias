’  ’ ’   A  Texas took a plea   deal on Wednesday and admitted to funneling dozens of guns   purchased in the US to a drug cartel in Mexico, the Associated   Press reports. ’ ’   Sgt. Julian Prezas faces up to 30 years in prison over charges   of lying on federal forms and illegal exportation of   firearms. Sentencing is set for March 23. ’ ’   The    soldier organized a group of fellow   servicemembers, who bought weapons and ammunition as ”straw   purchasers” that were later sold to members of the Gulf Cartel,    criminal organization in Mexico.   Prezas supplied the money to his fellow soldiers  —       in the case  —   who later received a cut of sales. ’ ’   Prezas admitted in court documents to acquiring 42 guns  —   23 of   which were later seized by the government. One of the     who became an informant against him, however, said   Prezas sold closer to 70   and   rifles,  to San Antonio  . ’ ’   Prezas was arrested in September 2015 trying to sell 17 guns to   an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and   Explosives,  to UPI.   Spc. Jaime Casillas and Staff   Sgt. Andrew Reyes are facing up to 10 years in prison, the     reports. ’
