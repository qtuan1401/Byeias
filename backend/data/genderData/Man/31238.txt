The victims of Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual assaults  —   Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones  —   have chimed in to the debate about what Bill Clinton should be called if Hillary Clinton takes the White House. [In a Breitbart News exclusive video interview filmed at the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, all three agreed that Clinton’s title should be the “First Rapist. ”  Watch the video here.  Asked by this reporter about suggestions that Clinton should be referred to as the “First Gentlemen” in the event of a Hillary Clinton presidency, all three women immediately shot down that title. “He is not a gentleman,” added Jones. They also rejected the “First Man” title, as well. “Well, I’ve heard the First Dude’” stated Willey. “The First Groper,” suggested Jones. “How about the First Rapist?” stated Willey. That title was the taker, with all three women agreeing and shaking their heads in unison. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
