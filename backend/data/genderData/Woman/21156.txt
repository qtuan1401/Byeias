According to a report from The Washington Post, a University of Virginia Professor has gone on leave in response to an uproar after he compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan on social media. [According to Post, the comments made by University of Virginia business Professor Douglas Muir were quickly denounced by university administrators. “The comment was written last week in response to a Facebook post about a Black Lives Matter event in Charlottesville  …     University officials later issued statements denouncing the comments and distancing themselves from [Professor Douglas] Muir. The professor has since taken leave, according to the university. ”  In response to criticism from the University of Virginia community, Muir deleted not only the controversial post but his entire Twitter account as well. A screenshot that was taken before Muir’s deletion reveals that his comment stated: “Black lives matter is the biggest rasist (sic) organisation (sic) since the clan (sic). Are you kidding me. Disgusting! !!”  On another note  …    I will NEVER frequent @Bellasrestaurant again. I met Doug Muir for the first time a couple of weeks ago at the @tomtomfestival  …    and I didn’t expect this from him, but if this is how he feels, he doesn’t have anything else to say to me. I would encourage everyone in the city to boycott the restaurant. I would also implore the @theuniversityofvirginia and the Darden School of Business @dardenmba (One that’s celebrating Diversity Week)  to address this issue immediately. The notion that #BlackLivesMatter can be comparable to the Klu Klux Klan is not only incredibly misguided, but goes to show the lack cultural awareness that still plagues many professors at our Universities across the country. An organization, a movement, a collective body that aims to empower Black People, and rally allies is not a terroristic organization, but one that aims to collective bring people together to address systemic oppression and racism, amongst other things, is here to stay. If #blacklivesmatter✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 offends you, makes you feel uncomfortable, or makes you believe that we are similar to the KKK  …    just understand this, times are changing, the movement is moving, and a people oppressed will no longer remain silent. We have support from the highest of the high to the lowest of the low, and WE are here to STAY and WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CREATE CHANGE! !! #blacklivesmatter✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 #BoycottBellas You have my number Frank Muir, I’ll await your call so that you can get the cultural training that you need. We can make a day, a week, a month, or however much time of it to get you where you need to be!

While the statement claims that the university believes in the importance of free speech and open discussion, it condemns Muir’s comment as “entirely inappropriate. ” A recent comment regarding the Black Lives Matter movement, posted on social media by Doug Muir, a lecturer in our School, has raised serious concerns about UVA Engineering’s commitment to diversity, inclusion and support of populations that are traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. While free speech and open discussion are fundamental principles of our nation and the University, Mr. Muir’s comment was entirely inappropriate. UVA Engineering does not condone actions that undermine our values, dedication to diversity and educational mission. Our faculty and staff are responsible for upholding our values and demonstrating them to students and the community. Mr. Muir has agreed to take leave and is preparing his own statement to the community. Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
