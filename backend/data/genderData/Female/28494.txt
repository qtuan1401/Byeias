Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” while commenting on the overnight shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, FL in which approximately 20 people were killed and over 40 were injured and that authorities are investigating as an act of terrorism, host Chuck Todd raised the “gun issue. ”  Todd said, “Joy [Reid] that’s the overwhelming feeling I have that  is there is this feeling of insecurity. We lack control on terrorism issue . We seem to lack control and moral on the gun issue. We lack cultural norms. There’s just a part of this that feels like a new normal. It’s a an uncomfortable normal. ”
