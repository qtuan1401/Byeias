’  ’ ’  ’ ’   One of the most   cities in America is right in   the middle of Pennsylvania Dutch country, where the Amish shun   technology and drive around in horse and buggies instead of   cars.  ’ ’   Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a city just shy of 60, 000 people,   has  cameras watching   and    . ’ ’   On the latest episode of  the podcast we   produce with Marketplace, host Ben Johnson discusses whether   or not the Lancaster cameras have changed behavior or   reduced crime over the years. Johnson also tries to figure   out whether such surveillance is a savior of modern society. ’ ’   ”It is abundantly clear that you are supposed to know that you’re   being watched,” Johnson says. ”What isn’t clear what the effect   has been.” ’ ’   Lancaster is not a dramatically   city. The majority   of crimes committed involve larceny or burglary. The city   usually has fewer than 10 murders each year. But a spike in   some crimes in early 2000 led a special commission to   recommend the installation of a camera system in 2001,  to The Guardian. ’ ’   ”It’’s a good witness,” Charlie Smithgall, the city’’s former   mayor, says of the cameras on the podcast. ’ ”   Interestingly, the cameras are not monitored by the city’s police   force. Instead, they are watched by a   group called the    which monitors and then   alerts police if suspicious activity is witnessed. And with the   cameras being used each day by police, the force has now come to   rely on it to solve crimes. ” ’   ”I can’’t imagine us not having it now,” says Lt. Todd Umstead. ’ ’   But some worry about privacy implications amid such mass   surveillance. The cameras are located everywhere  —   not just in     areas. And as social scientists point out, people act   differently when they know they are being watched, even when the   behavior they may engage in is not illegal. ’ ’ Listen to the full story in the episode below.
