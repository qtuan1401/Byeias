 (CNN) Two Southwest Airline planes bumped wings Saturday at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California, the Federal Aviation Administration said.  Passengers deplaned the two Boeing 737s after the wings clipped, FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer said. No injuries were reported, and the FAA will investigate the incident. While pushing back from the gate, the wingtip of Southwest Airlines flight 4721 came into contact with the other aircraft, Southwest spokeswoman Alyssa Eliasen said. Both planes were taken out of service for a maintenance check while airline employees worked to accommodate customers, she said. ”Safety is our number one focus and we will conduct an internal review to identify the details surrounding today’s event.”
