’  ’ ”   Tesla’s Autopilot    technology is under fire   after a fatal crash in Florida in May has called into question   whether some owners have invested too much trust in the system’s   capabilities. ” ’   Two   agencies are investigating the tragic   incident, along with other nonfatal accidents involving   Autopilot. ’ ’   The crash has also set off a debate about what the future holds   for driverless cars. ’ ”   But much of the discussion around Tesla’s response to the   incident is missing the point of Autopilot technology altogether. ” ’   Tesla was never trying to empower cars to drive themselves while   passengers took naps or watched TV. The company was instead   tackling a specific problem: using technology as a solution. ’ ’   That problem is safety  —   specifically, the extreme fallibility of   human drivers. A daunting 35, 000 people are killed in     accidents every year in the US alone, and many more   are injured. Most of the crashes are the result of driver error. ’ ”   There’s no technology that can completely relieve the driver of   responsibility for operating the vehicle, so since the advent of   the seat belt decades ago, safety is cars has concentrated on   protecting drivers and passengers from injury  —   and on preventing   accidents in the first place. ” ’   Seat belts led to air bags and crumple zones  —   sections of cars   and trucks that are designed to collapse on impact, dissipating   the energy of a crash. ’ ’  ’ ’   Then new systems were developed: antilock brakes, traction and   stability control, and, more recently, automatic emergency   braking,   warning, and collision avoidance  —     technologies that use sensors, cameras, and radar. ’ ”   Tesla Autopilot is a logical evolution of these advancements, and   consistent with the company’s vision of addressing transportation   challenges sooner than the traditional auto industry. ” ’   The bottom line is that Tesla is trying to design vehicles with   the idea that safety is the primary consideration. And, for the   most part, safety advocates agree that giving drivers more   technology on this front, versus with distracting or complicated   infotainment systems, is a good way to go. ’ ’   Unfortunately, Autopilot has been perceived as          tech rather than intensified   safety. ’ ’   Even Autopilot’’s most controversial feature,   is   calibrated not to permit the driver to take   his hands off the wheel and let the car steer oneself, but rather   to follow a curve more precisely than a human would. In my   experience, the system plots a series of short straight lines   through a curve, rather than steering through in a continuous   motion, which reduces the chance that the car will ”oversteer.” ’ ’  ’ ’   It’’s ironic that the safety of Tesla vehicles is now in doubt as   a result of the company pushing the safety envelope. But as I’’ve   already argued, additional owner training  —   call it ””  —   could correct any misperceptions that owners   might have about the capabilities of their Teslas. ’ ”   They’re not supposed to be driving themselves. They’re supposed   to be helping you do a better and therefore safer   job of driving yourself. ” ”   Familiar safety technologies haven’t always been perfect. Seat   belts can injure people in a crash if they   aren’t equipped with precrash tensioning systems. ” ’   Passenger air bags were resulting in death and injuries to   children before manufacturers added deactivation sensors to the   front seats. New air bags also have vents in the bags themselves   so that they can deflate slightly, preventing injuries when   drivers or passengers hit them. ’ ”   The issue with the next wave of    systems is   that their purpose is to avoid crashes, but that can give drivers   the wrong impression  —   that they can tune out and let the car   take control. Reasonable and experienced drivers will realize   quickly that they can’t do that. ” ”   But because Tesla Autopilot does such a good job of dealing with   mundane driving, even a veteran driver’s prudent distrust is   switched off by letting a machine that weighs thousands of pounds   and can go 100 mph do its own thing. ” ”   Avoiding that situation is simply a matter of reminding drivers   that safety isn’t magic and, until we have millions of miles of     cars in the record books, at some very distant   future point, truly safe driving begins and end with the guy   behind the wheel. ”
