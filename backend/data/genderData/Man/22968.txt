Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was asked if she would be seeing the new movie “13 Hours,” on the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.  Clinton replied, “I’m just too busy, campaigning. I am still very focused on making sure we do everything we can as I did when I was secretary of state, as I testify to over 11 hours to make sure that nothing like that happens again. And so far as we are able to prevent. And that’s my focus when it comes to the continuing obligation at it United States government has, whenever we send anyone into harm’s way. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
