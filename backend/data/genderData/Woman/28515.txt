ALEPPO (SYRIA) (AFP)  —   Ambulances and buses carrying the first evacuees from Aleppo left remaining   territory in the city on Thursday under a fragile exit deal, an AFP correspondent reported. [A   convoy of around two dozen vehicles snaked out of   district and crossed into   Ramussa en route to   territory in the west of Aleppo province.  The convoy was led by vehicles from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, followed by ambulances and then green government buses. ICRC spokeswoman Ingy Sedky said the first convoy included 13 ambulances and 20 buses carrying civilians. “They have crossed the front line and are on their way to rural parts of western Aleppo,” she told AFP. The first people to leave were the wounded and sick, and their relatives. The convoy moved across the Ramussa bridge and was expected to travel to the town of Khan   in the west of Aleppo province, under the agreement brokered by government backer Russia and opposition supporter Turkey. The fragile deal was supposed to begin on Wednesday morning, but collapsed briefly with a return to violence sending panicked civilians who had gathered to leave scrambling to find safety. After hours of talks, the deal was revived, and was expected to be implemented throughout Thursday and possibly into the coming days. The evacuation comes after a   army operation to recapture all of east Aleppo, a rebel stronghold since 2012. The army now holds more than 90 percent of the city’s east.
