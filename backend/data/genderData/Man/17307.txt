One Ohio sheriff is urging his civilian employees to carry a gun to work every day for their own “personal safety. ”[In the wake of the heinous shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, the sheriff —  Richard Jones, of Butler County, Ohio —  reminded his civilian staff to observe and obey all Ohio concealed carry laws, but stressed that being armed is part of the “extra caution” he wants his employees to take at this time.  According to WLWT, Jones sent out a memo in which he “urged employees to plan their attire appropriately and carry their weapons discreetly when in public view. ” In other words, he wants them to be prepared without drawing attention to themselves. The memo went out not only to employees but also to volunteers who help the Butler County Sheriff’s Office. Jones wants them “to carry their weapons at the sheriff’s office and while operating any department vehicle away from headquarters. ” Five Dallas Police officers were shot and killed on July 7 and three Baton Rouge officers were shot and killed on July 17. Also on July 17, a Milwaukee Police Officer was shot and wounded while sitting in his patrol car.
