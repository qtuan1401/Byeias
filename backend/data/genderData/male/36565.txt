 (CNN) You couldn’t watch   TV in the 1990s without coming across Miss Cleo’s ads.  The iconic TV psychic enticed viewers to call her so she could use the power of the tarot to tell your future. With a Jamaican accent, Miss Cleo, who’s real name is Youree Harris, would end the ad with, ”Call me now for your free reading.” Harris, 53, lost her battle with cancer on Tuesday, according to an attorney for her family. Fans took to social media to reminisce on the times they had called Miss Cleo in hopes of learning what the future may have in store. ”I’m sad that Miss Cleo has died. Her voice kept me company during many a   infomercial insomnia attack,” posted one user. As many people found out, the call to Miss Cleo wasn’t completely free and some even racked up hundreds of dollars in telephone bills. ”RIP Miss Cleo. I’ll never forget the time when I was 7 years old and called for my fortune. My parents got a bill for $300,” one person posted on Twitter. ”One time I ran my mom’s phone bill up ’cause my girlfriends and I called miss Cleo at a sleepover. To see if our crushes liked us,” another user posted.
