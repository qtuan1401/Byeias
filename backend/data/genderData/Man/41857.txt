 (CNN) Felix Kiprono, a lawyer in Nairobi, Kenya, has his eye on someone special: President Obama’s daughter Malia. His offer to win her hand? Fifty cows, 70 sheep and 30 goats. ”People might say I am after the family’s money, which is not the case. My love is real,” he told the Nairobian newspaper. Moreover, he adds, he’s been faithful to his beloved since he first became aware of her. ”I got interested in her in 2008,” he said. ”As a matter of fact, I haven’t dated anyone since and promise to be faithful to her. I have shared this with my family and they are willing to help me raise the bride price.” He’s currently working on a letter to announce his intentions and plans to give it to the local U. S. Embassy. According to prices on Africa Farming, Kiprono’s offer could be worth in excess of $90, 000. There are some issues, of course. For one, Malia Obama is 16. For another, she’ll have to develop a taste for village life. ”Ours will be a simple life. I will teach Malia how to milk a cow, cook ugali (a starchy dish) and prepare mursik (a sour milk) like any other Kalenjin woman,” he said.
