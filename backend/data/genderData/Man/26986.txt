A female prison guard in Switzerland has reportedly “freed” a   convicted migrant rapist and fled with him, possibly to Syria, reports Die Welt. [Hassan Kiko, who came to Switzerland as an illegal migrant from Syria, was convicted of raping a    woman in an asylum centre in 2012. After being let out, he raped an underage    in 2014. Mr. Kiko was sentenced to four years in prison for the offence and until recently spent it at a detention centre in Zurich.  Now the husband of a nurse alleged to have helped him escape has reported that he fears the pair have fled to Syria, noting a “change in her behaviour” including a   interest in the Quran. Angela Magdici, a guard at the prison, is alleged to have waited for her colleagues to fall asleep on Monday   morning before releasing Mr. Kiko from his cell. The pair reportedly fled in Magdici’s brand new BMW, and are now the subjects of an international arrest warrant. Only two guards are ever on duty at the detention centre, and one works while the other sleeps. As a result, it wasn’t until 5am that the alarm went off signalling the escape.   year old Ms. Magdici may have become the lover of the migrant rapist, but a spokesperson for the prison said that no one had noticed any such behaviour from her and that nothing between the two seemed out of the ordinary. She has been working for the Limmattal Correctional Centre since 2013 and is one of several women who work at the facility. The idea of having women at a prison for men, according to the Swiss Office of Corrections is to make sure the male inmates are still able to “deal with women,” while behind bars. Ms. Magdici is married but separated. Her    husband is a warehouse worker who told Swiss media he also suspects she became intimate with Mr. Kiko after seeing a change in her behaviour which included starting to study the Quran a few months ago.
