Huffington Post Washington bureau chief Ryan Grim jumped on social media on Monday and mockingly suggested that shutting down the embattled Clinton Foundation could stop the “oligarchs” of the world from fulfilling their life’s work of  “eradicating disease and poverty. ”[“If you shut down the Clinton Foundation,” Grim tweeted, “how would the world’s oligarchs achieve their main goal in life, eradicating disease and poverty? ?”  “Think of the oligarchs!! Have you no humanity?” the political reporter posted in another snarky missive.

Have you no humanity?  —   Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) August 22, 2016,  The Huffington Post began the week with its front page banner screaming “Shut it Down,” the headline linking to a New York Times article that highlighted several shady Clinton Foundation donors who saw their   dollar donations coincide with favorable federal actions while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Grim’s screeds, sarcastic as they seem, came on the same day that his   news site featured a blog that hailed Clinton Cash as “the single most damaging attack on Clinton in this election cycle. ” In the aforementioned Huffington Post piece, writer William Bradley lauded the documentary film based on Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer’s New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash as “pretty darn good. ” Bradley even managed to sneak the full version of the explosive documentary inside his article. Grim’s tweets also came on the same day that the Democratic presidential candidate was being dogged by yet another embarrassing revelation that she used her position as Secretary of State to grant preferential treatment and special access to major Clinton Foundation donors.
