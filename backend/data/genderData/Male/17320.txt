On June 24 the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) mocked Congress as cowards for not passing expanded background checks in the wake of the Orlando terror attack, an attack in which Omar Mateen shot and killed 49 people with a rifle he bought via a background check. [MPAC also singled out the Senate for not expanding gun control in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting. They specifically criticized the Senate’s refusal to turn a blind eye to Due Process protections and add the   list —  and other watch lists —  to the prohibited buyers list for the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS).  They did not point out that the San Bernardino attackers —  Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik —  were not on watchlists, so inclusion of said lists would not have done anything to prevent them from acquiring firearms. On the other hand, MPAC admits there may be some problems with lists like the “FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database,” but they hedge their admission by suggesting the NRA’s money motivates Republican leadership to see these problems. They praised the Democrat’s failed gun control   which was conducted Wednesday to Thursday of this week. MPAC dismisses Republican concerns over “radical Islam” as a diversion. They then intimate that a June 11 shooting death in California, a June 11 shooting death in Charlotte, a “possible   in Los Angeles” —  and two other June 11 shootings around the country —  demonstrate that radical Islam isn’t behind all mass shootings. They do not mention that a single murder is not a mass shooting, nor to they point out that California has expanded background checks and numerous other gun controls on the Democrats’ wish list. If these controls work so well, why are people in California still being killed with guns?
