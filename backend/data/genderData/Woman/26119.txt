Production crew members working on Amazon’s original transgender series Transparent are uncomfortable after management made all bathrooms on the set gender neutral  —   particularly women. [Amid a nationwide debate about public restroom privacy, TMZ reports the   show made its facilities unisex. Despite the show being centered around a man’s journey to live his life as woman, not everyone on the crew is comfortable sharing bathrooms.  After speaking to sources close to Transparent, TMZ reports that “men, women and transgenders” are all sharing the same restrooms and that the women are “particularly worried about walking in and seeing a dude peeing at the urinal. ” In addition to feeling uncomfortable sharing bathrooms, those with privacy complaints are too afraid to take their grievances to management out of fear they will be labeled “transphobic. ” Amazon has not commented on the TMZ report. Transparent is about a father, played by Jeffrey Tambor, coming out as transgender to his family. The series won a 2015 Golden Globe for best musical or comedy series, and Tambor won the award for best lead actor. The show’s third season will premiere some time in 2016. Transparent is partially based on the family of its creator and showrunner Jill Soloway, whose father is transgender. Many of her show’s actors and crew members also identify as transgender. WATCH:
