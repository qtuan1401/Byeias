Update, 7:11 pm ET:  Statement released by 21th Century Fox: The Company has seen the allegations against Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy. We take these matters seriously. While we have full confidence in Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy, who have served the company brilliantly for over two decades, we have commenced an internal review of the matter. Statement released by Roger Ailes: Gretchen Carlson’s allegations are false. This is a retaliatory suit for the network’s decision not to renew her contract, which was due to the fact that her disappointingly low ratings were dragging down the afternoon lineup. When Fox News did not commence any negotiations to renew her contract, Ms. Carlson became aware that her career with the network was likely over and conveniently began to pursue a lawsuit. Ironically, FOX News provided her with more   opportunities over her 11 year tenure than any other employer in the industry, for which she thanked me in her recent book. This defamatory lawsuit is not only offensive, it is wholly without merit and will be defended vigorously. ** NEW YORK (AP)  —   Former Fox News Channel anchor Gretchen Carlson is suing network chief executive Roger Ailes, claiming she was fired after refusing his sexual advances. Fox News representatives did not immediately return requests for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in Superior Court in New Jersey’s Bergen County. Carlson, the former host of a daytime show at Fox, alleged a pattern of discriminatory behavior at Fox. She says she was fired in June. She says that happened nine months after Ailes told her that “you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago. ” The    Carlson was Miss America in 1989. She spent 11 years at Fox.
