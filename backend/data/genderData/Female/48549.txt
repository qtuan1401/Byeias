’  ’ ’   A bomb that injured 29 people in New York City on Saturday night   was made with a pressure cooker, flip phone, and Christmas   lights, and it was filled with ”fragmentation materials” such as   ”small bearings or metal BBs,” . ’ ’   Another bomb found nearby that did not detonate was made from the   same materials. ’ ’   The two homemade devices appeared to be designed to inflict   maximum damage, The Times reported. ’ ”   Investigators have yet to determine the motive for  which occurred at about 8:30 p. m. on Saturday in   Manhattan’s bustling Chelsea neighborhood. ” ’   But authorities said they had identified a ”person of interest”   in the case, The Times reported. ’ ’’ ’ the police are looking to speak with a man who was   spotted in surveillance footage near both bomb locations. ’ ’   Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York called the bombing ”obviously an   act of terrorism” but said it did not appear to be linked to   international terrorist groups. ’ ”     officials are exploring a possible connection   between Saturday night’s bombing in New York and an  earlier that day in Seaside Park, New   Jersey, The Times reported. In that explosion, three pipe bombs   were tied together, placed in a trash can, and controlled by a   flip phone, officials said. ” ’   Only one of the three bombs detonated, and no one was injured in   the blast, which occurred shortly before thousands of runners   were due to participate in a charity 5K to benefit US Marines and   sailors. ’
