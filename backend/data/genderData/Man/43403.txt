During the IPO roadshow they held   meetings in hotel rooms after underwriters and investors had left for the day, Bloomberg reported.’ ’ that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs advised on the sale along with Qatalyst.’ ’While Cisco has been interested in a deal with AppDynamics for months, Fortune reports that it wasn’’t until late last week that the company decided to go after a merger ”aggressively. ”’ ’Qatalyst founder Frank Quattrone is a   adviser to Cisco, which frequently acquires companies.’ ”It’s worth noting Cisco has made this sort of play before.
