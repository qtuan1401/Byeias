During testimony before Congress on Thursday, FBI Director James Comey stated that the servers maintained by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were less secure than a Gmail account.  Comey was asked whether a previous statement he made comparing Clinton’s servers to Gmail was implying “that the private email servers of Secretary Clinton’s were perhaps less secure than a Gmail account, that is used for free, by a billion people around this planet?” He answered, “Yes, and I’m not looking to pick on Gmail. Their security is actually pretty good. The weakness is in the individual users. But, yes, Gmail has full time security staff, and thinks about patching and logging and protecting their systems in a way that was not the case here. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
