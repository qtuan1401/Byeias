Politico reports that President Obama’s upcoming executive gun control will force a number of private gun sellers to get their Federal Firearms License (FFL) and perform background checks on every gun sold. [This is will not do away with the nonexistent “gun show loophole,” but it will further limit Americans’ freedom to sell guns to their neighbors or family members without a background check —  which is ultimately what Democrats want to accomplish anyway.  According to Politico, “Obama will tighten the definition of what it means to be ‘engaged in the business’ of firearms sales. ” Currently, those who sell firearms with the “principal objective of livelihood and profit” must have an FFL. Those selling as hobby or those who sell occasionally from a private collection do not. Obama plans to change the language so that those who sell as a hobby will be placed under the same heading as those who sell for a living. Breitbart News previously reported that Micheal Bloomberg met with Obama in   to discuss using an executive action to bypass Congress and secure this gun control expansion. Obama is also expected to add new requirements to the numerous ones already in place for FFLs by “[imposing] tighter rules for reporting guns that get lost or stolen on their way to a buyer. ” Neither of these executive gun controls would have prevented even one of high profile shootings from the last decade, but both will succeed in placing a further burden on the exercise of the 2nd Amendment.
