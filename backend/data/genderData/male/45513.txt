’’ ’The Harvard Graduate School of Education released a  on Wednesday endorsed by dozens of other schools that proposes radical changes to the way colleges evaluate prospective students.’ ’The proposal seeks to make college admissions less of a rat race that favors   students, and it has three specific recommendations to achieve this goal:’ ”Despite colleges’ efforts to have diverse student bodies, students from poor families are still rare on the campuses of elite colleges in America, .” ”Admissions departments’ focus on test scores,   classes, and superficial extracurriculars doesn’t help underprivileged students, according to the Harvard report released on Wednesday. Rather, community involvement  —   whether that be a service project or caring for your family  —   should be emphasized in the application process.” ’Giving students clear opportunities to report their contributions to their families on their college applications  —   whether that involves working outside the house, watching over younger siblings, or taking on major household chores  —   can help underprivileged students, who may not be able to participate in the expensive sports or international trips that often determine   admissions.’ ’’ ’The report also noted that community service should be ”meaningful” and ”sustained” rather than an activity that students participate in to boost their chances of getting accepted into college.’ ’While the Harvard report admits that admissions departments are unlikely to take its recommendations wholesale, it does hope to ”create a healthier balance in young people between their   and their investment in others and the larger world. ”’
