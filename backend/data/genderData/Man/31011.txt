Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” when asked why with his message of income equality is he losing the states with the highest levels of income inequality to his opponent Hillary Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said, “because poor people don’t vote. ”  Sanders said, “Because poor people don’t vote. I mean, that’s just a fact. A sad reality of American society. And that’s what we have to transform. We, as you know, have one of the lowest voter turnout rates. We have had some success with lower income people, but in America today, in the last election in 2014, 80% of poor people did not vote. ” He added, “If we could significantly increase voter turnout so younger people and poor people participated in the voter process, we could have a voter turnout of 75 percent, this country would be radically transformed. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
