On Friday, HBO’s “Real Time” host Bill Maher wondered if GOP presidential candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz was making “a dog whistle” by referencing “New York values. ”  Maher asked, “But wasn’t he looking also to make a dog whistle? Because when they asked him at the debate what do you mean by New York values? He said, I think people here in South Carolina know what I mean. And then he went on to say like, people in New York  …    they dominate the media and money. ” Maher then sarcastically wondered, which ethnic group “dominates media and money?” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
