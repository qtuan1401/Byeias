’   After a slow start to their Wild Card game vs. the New York   Giants, the Green Bay Packers warmed up in the second quarter,   thanks, as always, to Aaron Rodgers. ’ ’   At the end of the second quarter, with the Packers leading     Rodgers made magic happen yet again. ’ ”   With five seconds remaining, on 4th and 2, Rodgers scrambled   around an oncoming Giants defense and uncorked a Hail Mary from   the Packers’ 48. ” ’   The ball sailed through the air and Randall Cobb easily slid   behind a pack of players to catch the touchdown. ’ ’ ’ ’   Unreal. ’ ’ ’ ’   The pass completely deflated a solid   effort by the   Giants defense, which held the Packers to just seven yards in the   first quarter. However, in the waning moments of the first half,   Rodgers got going, hitting Cobb for a   touchdown with   under two minutes left before his    Hail Mary. ’
