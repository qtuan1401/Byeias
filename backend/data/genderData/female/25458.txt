Former Boston Red Sox ace Curt Schilling was the special guest at a “Breitbart News Patriot Forum” listener event for SiriusXM in New York City on Wednesday. [At one point during the event, Schilling spoke passionately about his feelings as regards the treatment of America’s veterans, as well as the current state of the Veterans Administration (VA).  “I think it’s disgusting that we ask these men and women to give their lives, to sacrifice their families and all those things, and we don’t take care of them when they come home,” Schilling said. “I think it should be a crime if a veteran is homeless,” he added. “Somebody should pay for that, legally. Our Veterans Administration is such a mess. Now, you’re going to have good stories, and I’ve seen people say the VA has been great to me. But overall, they need to gut that entire thing and bring in people that actually give a crap about the men and women that have served and their families. ” To hear the full interview with Curt Schilling tune into Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 at 8:00am tomorrow, Thursday, April 28.
