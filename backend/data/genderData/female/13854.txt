During an interview with Representative Adam Schiff ( ) on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher said he wants Democrats to make the sale that “You’re either with us or with the Russians. ”  Maher said, “[W]hy can’t the Democrats make this sale? You’re either with us or with the Russians. Remember Bush? You’re either with us, or with the terrorists. I feel like  —   that’s what  —   all I want to hear. ” Schiff responded, “I will tell you this, if there was ever a time in our history where the argument [that] there has to be a check on this executive, we need to change the Congress so there is a Democratic House or Senate, or both, because this president needs a restraint, that argument is now. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
