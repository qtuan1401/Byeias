During the January 10 airing of ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio said the aim of Obama’s current gun control push is “to keep guns out of the hands of   citizens. ”[He said that is the impetus behind Obama’s “continuing [push] to put new restrictions on our gun rights. ”  Rubio’s comments came after Stephanopoulos said claims that Obama wants to confiscate guns are unfounded. Stephanopoulos said Obama has not proposed gun confiscation. Rubio responded that confiscation is the logical end of Obama’s gun control policy, saying, “He would if he could. Obviously he knows he’s constrained by the Second Amendment so what he tries to do is chip away at it every chance he gets. ” Rubio added: Let me tell you what he’s trying to do. He is trying to keep guns out of the hands of   citizens by continuing to put new restrictions on our gun rights. Let me give you an example.   …    Barack Obama says he wants this debate to be about fact and truth. Good. Let’s have it about fact and truth. Here’s the fact and here’s the truth: none of the attacks that he is talking about, none of these horrible, horrifying tragedies that have occurred that he cites as the rationale for these measures that he’s taking, not a single one of them would have been prevented by anything he’s proposing. And the reason why is because killers and criminals do not care what the gun laws are. They are not going to go to someone that conducts background checks. They will continue to get their guns the way they have always gotten their guns: from the black markets, stolen guns, et cetera. So this is absurd. And the only people that are going to follow this law are   people. This is nothing but an effort from the Left to continue to chip away at the Second Amendment rights of   Americans.
