Those who consider themselves as “very right wing” are more likely to have a satisfactory sex life, according to a new European survey by YouGov that interviewed over 19, 000 people. [Just 66% of “left wing” Brits claimed to have a satisfactory sex life. This was significantly less than the 73% of Brits who considered themselves both “very right wing” and sexually satisfied, and the 70% who considered themselves “right wing” and satisfied.  In Germany, 77% of those who considered themselves very right wing also claimed to be satisfied in bed, while 71% of very left wing people claimed to have the same sexual satisfaction. In all five participating countries (Sweden, Germany, France, Denmark, and Britain) very right wing people had the highest level of sexual satisfaction, whilst very left wing people tended to have the lowest on average. “There are obviously numerous factors that might explain an individual’s sexual happiness and this study does not suggest that changing your political views would make you happier in bed (or on the stairs, on the kitchen floor, in the shower and on the backseat of the car),” said YouGov’s head of political and social research, Joe Twyman to Buzzfeed News. The old rules about correlation not equalling causation always apply. Being very right wing doesn’t make you sexually satisfied, but nonetheless, these results suggest it is, in contrast to at least some stereotypes popular in the political world, those on the very right of the political spectrum who enjoy their sex life the most  —   and that this finding is true across a number of different European countries.
