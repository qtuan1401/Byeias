’  ’ ’   Colin Kaepernick defended his decision to not vote in the   presidential election, saying he thought it would be   ”hypocritical” to vote because he is against the ”system of   oppression” and that he did not want to support the system. ’ ’   This comes amid  that   Kaepernick has never registered to vote, either in California,   where he grew up and lives now, or in Nevada, where he attended   college. ’ ’   According to records obtained from the California Secretary of   State by the Sacramento Bee, Kaepernick, who turned 18 in 2005,   has not registered to vote in California at any time since 2005.   Likewise, he was not registered to vote in Nevada from 2006   through 2010, according to the county registrar of voters for   Reno, Nevada. ’ ’   As Alexei Koseff of the Sacramento Bee points out, this means   that Kaepernick would not have voted in either the 2008 or the   2012 presidential elections in which President Barack Obama was   elected, as well as other state and local elections and   initiatives. ’ ’   On Sunday, Kaepernick defended his decision to not vote . ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’   ’
