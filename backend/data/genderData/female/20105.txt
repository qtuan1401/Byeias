AP: Foundation donors gained access to Clinton at State Dept. .. @JoeNBC calls the details ’breathtaking’ https:  .  During the Wednesday broadcast of “Morning Joe” on MSNBC, host Joe Scarborough reacted to the Associated Press report that says at least 85 of 154 people from private interests who met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton while she led the State Department donated to her family charity or pledged commitments to its international programs, calling the high proportion “breathtaking. ”  “[F]or the Associated press to write in a news story this term, that it was ‘an extraordinary proportion [of donors]’ shows you just how out of skew this was.
