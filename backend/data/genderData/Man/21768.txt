Former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling was the special guest at a “Breitbart News Patriot Forum” listener event for SiriusXM in New York City on Wednesday. [Recently fired by ESPN for his views related to “a North Carolina’s law restricting   public restrooms in government buildings to people whose biology matches the insignia on the entrance,” Schilling was asked, in essence, why risk politically incorrect speech if he knew it might cause him problems at ESPN.  Said Schilling, “I guess I’ll come back to that question with a question, which is, if you’re not a racist, or a homophobic, or transphobic, or any of the things that phobic is attached to, why would voicing an opinion be risking anything? I mean, I get it in the Middle East, where that can get you beheaded. I get it in other countries. ” He added, “It’s not that I didn’t care. The memo that went out there to everybody the same, which was, if you’re a sportsperson, stick to sports. Don’t get involved in the political arena. In the end for me, that felt like that rule applied to me and me alone. ” To hear the full interview with Curt Schilling tune into Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 at 8:00 a. m. tomorrow, Thursday, April 28.
