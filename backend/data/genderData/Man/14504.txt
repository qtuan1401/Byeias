In an interview with The Dartmouth Review, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Christina Hoff Sommers, spoke about feminism, political correctness, and the state of free expression on college campuses. [In the interview, Sommers argued that girls and women are the privileged sex when it comes to educational status.  Girls and women are the privileged sex in education. From preschool to graduate school, and across ethnic and class lines, women get better grades, they win most of the honors and prizes, and they’re far more likely to go to college. Today women earn a majority of bachelor’s degrees and advanced degrees. Latino girls are now slightly more likely to attend college than white boys. When an education policy analyst looked at current trends in higher education he quipped, only half in jest, “The last male will graduate from college in 2068. ” Our schools have offered untold number of admirable and effective programs to strengthen girls in areas where they languished —  in sports, math, and science. Where are the programs to help boys in areas where they falter: reading, writing, grades, school engagement and college matriculation? So far Congress, schools of education, school boards and the Department of Education have looked the other way. She also argued that universities must move away from identity politics if they are to return to a place where all ideas are welcome to be explored.
