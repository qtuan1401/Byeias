With the unlikelihood the Oakland Raiders will make their home in Los Angeles new overtures by a San Antonio businessman aims to bring the storied NFL franchise to the Alamo City. [Tuesday, former Spurs and Minnesota Vikings owner Red McCombs told radio station   1250 that his group has “got the whole program put together” on how to relocate the Raiders to San Antonio.  “We still have to get them to want to come here,” McCombs acknowledged. Referring to Raiders owner Marc Davis, the    billionaire observed, “He was born and raised there and he has a great feeling for the state of California. But it appears he is going to need to go somewhere. ”  McCombs claims the NFL’s decision to allow the St. Louis Rams to relocate back to L. A. and offering the San Diego Chargers the option to join them, “clears the runway” for the Raiders to move elsewhere. According to the San Antonio Express, Marc Davis declined to comment on the move to San Antonio. Breitbart News reported in the summer of 2014 that Davis met with San Antonio city leaders to discuss the possible relocation of the Raiders from Oakland to San Antonio. ESPN reports now that Los Angeles rejected the Raiders from moving to the City of Lights, Davis doesn’t know where his team would play in 2016. “We don’t have a lease right now at the Oakland Coliseum,” he said. “America, the world is a possibility for the Raider Nation. ”
