On Friday’s broadcast of “CNN Newsroom,” CNN Global Affairs Correspondent Elise Labott and CNN Global Affairs Analyst Aaron David Miller characterized the US abstaining on a UN Security Council vote on the Israeli settlements as a “parting shot” by President Obama towards Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Labott said, “[Y]ou can’t neglect that this is a parting shot by President Obama to Prime Minister Netanyahu, with whom he had a rocky relationship at best over the last eight years. ” Miller added that he agreed with Labott’s point and “It was a parting shot in defense of what the Obama administration and Secretary Kerry believe to be the waning hopes of a   solution. My concern however, is that this is going to produce the opposite impact of what the administration intended. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
