Washington (CNN) New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie refuted reports that he has made the decision to run for president during a radio interview on Thursday night. ”There’s been absolutely no final decision made by me,” he said during his monthly ”Ask the Governor” radio appearance on NJ101. 5. ”There’s lots of people who speculate lots of things, and I can’t be held to account for every bit of speculation that’s in the press.” A GOP source familiar with his plans said earlier on Thursday Christie would announce his presidential bid on June 30 at Livingston High School in New Jersey.   Christie, who attended Livingston High School, is expected to talk extensively about his upbringing and how that has shaped the person and leader he is, the source said.  Following his announcement, he will travel to New Hampshire later that day for a town hall meeting.
