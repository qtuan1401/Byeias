Thursday in Warren, OH, MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt confronted Vice President Joe Biden over whether Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has been “100 percent ethical,” in light of the various    accusations between   Hillary Clinton’s State Department and her family’s organization, the Clinton Foundation.  Partial transcript as follows: HUNT: Hillary Clinton obviously is not on the trail. You’re here in Ohio. Do you think she needs to be out front with the American people a little bit more? BIDEN: She is out front with the American people. HUNT: She’s been   for a couple weeks. BIDEN: She has to, but she’s also been doing a lot of events and I told her I’d campaign with her in Scranton. We got a whole bunch of places we’re campaigning together and some places where maybe I can help and not have her have to be with me. HUNT: Do you think Americans should be concerned at all about the ethics of The Clinton Foundation? Has The Clinton Foundation always been 100 percent ethical in your view?’ BIDEN: I think The Clinton Foundation, like all foundations, have found themselves in a position where things are changing and I think she’s going to change, adjust to the realities of how complicated it’s all become. HUNT: Is she clearing herself up enough with that? Should the foundation have stopped taking foreign donations now? BIDEN: I think you’ll stop seeing them taking foreign donations.
