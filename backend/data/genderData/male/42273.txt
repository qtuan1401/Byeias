 (CNN) Police officers fired 12 rounds during a deadly shootout last month at a restaurant in Waco, Texas, authorities said Friday in a news release. Waco police said 44 shell casings have been recovered from the scene where nine bikers were killed during a shootout at a Twin Peaks restaurant. Twelve of those casings came from the . 223 caliber rifles of three SWAT officers, who were in adjacent parking lots.  Police couldn’t say whether any of those bullets killed or wounded any bikers. Other agencies are doing autopsies and ballistic analysis, Waco police said.  The three officers, who had their weapons set to semiautomatic mode, are on administrative duty as the investigation into the incident continues. Police said they have not yet recovered casings that remained in revolvers used during the shootings.  After the May 17 shooting, 177 people were arrested and held in jail on $1 million bail each.
