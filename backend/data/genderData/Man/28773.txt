Former NFL running back Ricky Williams believes he would be in the Hall of Fame if marijuana was allowed in the league.  On HBO’s “Any Given Wednesday,” host Bill Simmons asked the 1998 Heisman trophy winner if he would be a Hall of Famer if weed was legal, which Williams said he “for sure” would have been. “No doubt about it,” Williams replied. “I look at the amount of stress and other things that distracted me from playing football surrounding cannabis. The first half of my career when it was pretty much a secret and no one knew, I used and I could do it as I wished. ” Williams then blamed the “negative media coverage” for his “tarnished image. ” In 2004, Williams retired amid speculation he would be banned a whole season for failing a drug test. He returned in 2005, and sat out four games for the failed test. Williams then missed the entire 2006 season for failing another. He retired for the final time in 2011 finishing up with 10, 009 rushing yards and 66 touchdowns in 10 seasons with Miami Dolphins, the New Orleans Saints and Baltimore Ravens.
