 (CNN) Fresh off his performance with his band the Foo Fighters on David Letterman’s final show, Dave Grohl kept the good times rolling this weekend. Grohl rocked out on guitar in London, joining Paul McCartney onstage for a performance of the Beatles’ ”I Saw Her Standing There.” Fans caught footage of the jam session at the first of McCartney’s two concerts at London’s O2 Arena on Saturday. Grohl also confessed his love for another major music star: Taylor Swift. Both were featured acts at the Radio 1 Big Weekend in Norwich, and the Foo Fighters frontman dedicated the single ”Congregation,” from their latest album, to Taylor Swift, as the song was written in her hometown of Nashville. ”I’m officially obsessed,” Grohl said. ”She might want to get a restraining order.” Join the club, Dave.  Swift, who also performed at Big Weekend, retweeted BBC Radio 1’s tweet quoting Grohl’s obsession with her.
