White House Correspondents’ Dinner host Larry Wilmore closed his speech on Saturday by telling President Obama, “Yo Barry, you did it, my n*gga. ”  Earlier in the speech, Wilmore said that former President Andrew Jackson reacted to Dr. Ben Carson’s defense of Jackson being kept on the $20 bill by asking, “What did that j*gaboo say?” At the tail end, “Mr. President, I’m going to keep it 100. Yo Barry, you did it, my n*gger. ” Wilmore then thumped his chest, to which Obama replied with a chest thump of his own. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
