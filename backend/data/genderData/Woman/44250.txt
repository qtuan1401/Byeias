’  ’ ’     How else to explain the $1. 9 billion that the     Oakland Raiders and Clark County, home of Las Vegas, have     committed to spend on the new stadium that lured the team to     Nevada?   ’ ’     This sum was announced last summer, but the details only     fell into place this month. The team announced a $650 million     loan from Bank of America earlier this month, and on Monday     overcame the NFL’s longtime opposition to a team in Sin City.     League franchise owners voted 31 —  1 to approve the move.   ’ ’     Las Vegas appears poised to claim the mantle of World’s Most     Expensive Stadium from East Rutherford, New Jersey, where the     Jets and Giants play in the $1. 6 billion MetLife Stadium. (Los     Angeles Stadium, Stan Kroenke’s project that will host the Rams     and Chargers, is estimated at $2. 6 billion —  but that cost     includes parts of the surrounding entertainment district. *)   ’ ’     Clark County taxpayers will contribute $750 million to the new     arena, a record for a sports facility —  about $354 per resident,     taken from an increased tax on hotel rooms. That tax     currently pays for schools and transportation, in addition to       expenditures.   ’ ’     Stanford economist Roger Noll  it was the “worst     deal for a city” he had ever seen.   ’ ’     That it came together at all is remarkable.   ’ ’     The Nevada statehouse gave its approval for the room tax hike     in October. Clark County gave the OK in November. Sheldon     Adelson, the casino magnate and Republican megadonor who owns     the Las Vegas   had pledged to     invest $650 million of his family’s money in the stadium —  and an       Adelson saw the stadium     as a “legacy project. ”   ’ ’     When Nevada and Clark County approved the hotel tax hike,     then, the split was  : $500 million from the     Raiders, $650 million from Adelson (the board of his Sands     Corp. rejected the idea of investing company money) and $750     million from a hotel room tax hike.   ’ ’     But in January, Adelson  and the     deal looked all but dead. Goldman Sachs, which the team had     portrayed as a backup lender in case the     Adelson investment fell through,  a deal     without Adelson.   ’ ’     That Bank of America (which also funded Santa Clara’s Levi’s     Stadium) jumped in with a   loan of $650 million     surprised Steve Sisolak, the chairman of the Clark County     Commission, the body that had approved the hotel tax     hike. Sisolak had questions about the financing earlier     this month, the San Jose Mercury     News :   ’ ’     Adelson might have believed his civic contribution would     compensate for tiny returns. What does Bank of America     see?   ’ ’     It’s certainly an anomaly. The only two     sports stadiums within $500 million of the Vegas cost are     MetLife and the     Los Angeles Stadium, each of     which has something that Vegas’ new arena does not: two pro     teams.   ’ ’     And then there’s the taxpayer contribution. Some cities forgo     future property tax revenue for a pro stadium, or issue       bonds paid off by the teams themselves, or contribute     complimentary infrastructure like utility work or a nearby     train station. But Las Vegas will pay for the thing     itself —  and with a tax on hotel rooms, something it     already has. (Bonds will be repaid over 30     years with the tax revenue.)   ’ ’     The state’s figures to justify that new tax are   …         ambitious. Its forecasts 450, 000 new visitors     every year drawn by the   stadium, spending an     average of 3. 2 nights per visit. About a third of tickets are     supposed to be purchased by tourists, although no other     city  10     percent. Why half a million people would fly across the     country to watch a team that no one wants to pay $20 to see in     Oakland is not clear. A reminder from Brookings’ big     September  on taxpayer     subsidies for stadiums:   ’ ’  ’ ’     A tax on hotel rooms at first seems to be an affair for the     tourism industry. Hotel owners testified in its favor. And so     we have a battle between two interconnected ideas:   ’ ’     But it’s not just a problem for the tourism industry. It’s     true that the Clark County room tax was originally intended to     fund bonds for the Las Vegas Convention Center in the     ‘50s, and continued to support the Las Vegas Convention and     Visitors Authority, the marketing arm of a city that lives and     dies on marketing. (They are responsible for the “What Happens     in Vegas” campaign.)   ’ ’     But these days, about half the room tax goes to  state schools     and county transportation. So if the new tax on hotel     rooms directed to the stadium does drive room prices down,     the money comes out of schools and buses. In fiscal year 2015,     a quarter of the tax paid for Nevada education, another 14     percent for the Clark County School District, and 9 percent for     Clark County Transportation.   ’ ’     “So much of this action was premature and rushed through,”     Chris Giunchigliani, the lone dissenting official on     the Clark County Commission, told the Las Vegas       after the measure was approved in     November. “It’s bad public policy to take public tax dollars,     especially the largest subsidy (for a stadium project) in the     United States, and claim it’s going to benefit economic     development. ”   ’ ’     If occupancy rates and room prices are resilient to tax     increases, then Nevada might otherwise have funneled that money     into solving the CCSD’s  problem. But maybe the teachers will be more     excited to stay in Las Vegas when the Raiders (who have not won     a playoff game since 2002) come to town.   ’ ’How else to explain the $1. 9 billion that the. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
