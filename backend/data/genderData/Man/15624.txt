TEL AVIV  —   Qatari daily   published an   poem for its special Ramadan supplement last Monday. Titled “The Plot of the Jews,” it accuses Jews of spreading corruption among Muslims . [The poem, by Dr. Khaled Hassan Hindawi, charges Jews with hatching plots against Muslims using partners in top positions of power in the Arab world.  Referring to them as “venomous serpents,” these partners supposedly include Egyptian President ‘Abd     Syrian President Bashar   Iraqi Prime Minister Haider  ‘Abadi, and the leader of the Houthi Rebels in Yemen, ‘Abd    . The Middle East Media Research Institute published a translation of the poem: The Plot of the Jews, The Jew’s plot against the Muslims, Their corruption is spread through ideas and bombardments, With planes and with sharpened tongues, [They send forth] venomous serpents, That penetrate our fortress in times of distress. Let me list these serpents, they are Bashar and Sisi, And Houthi and Haider  ‘Abadi, Qatar has long been at loggerheads with Egypt over Qatar’s allegiance to the Muslim Brotherhood. Doha condemned a Cairo court for sentencing two Al Jazeera journalists to death on charges of transferring secret security documents to Qatar during ousted president Mohammed Morsi’s tenure.
