Natl security expert Jim Hanson: Obama  Kerry are chumps, who because of ransom deals like this, made us less safehttps:  .  On Wednesday’s “Fox  Friends” on the Fox News Channel Center for Security Policy Executive Vice President Jim Hanson stated that the payment of $400 million to Iran as four Americans were released from the country back in January is “absolutely a ransom. ”  Hanson said of the payment, “Oh, it’s absolutely a ransom.   …     I don’t know any other reason why you would stack Swiss francs and euros on pallets and put them on an unmarked plane to fly them to Iran. It makes you wonder whether the Iran deal itself was written using   letters from a newspaper. I think the problem with this is, the Obama administration has demonstrated that they can be rolled. They paid cash and released terrorists for Bowe Bergdahl. We paid cash and released terrorist financiers to get this deal done. Who knows what they did with the Iranian sailors?” Hanson added that President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are “chumps. And they have been played by every world leader that they’ve come in contact with. They have made every American now a target for a tyrant who knows they can get a payoff. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
