Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated, “I just don’t understand what that means” when asked if she was part of the establishment on Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Situation Room. ”  Hillary was asked, “[Democratic presidential candidate Sen.] Bernie Sanders ( )  says his campaign is taking on the political establishment, saying your endorsements for example from the Human Rights Campaign, from Planned Parenthood are because you’re part of the establishment. Are you?” She responded, “Well, I have to say, I didn’t understand that at all. Planned Parenthood does so much on the front lines to provide women, and men, healthcare, often low income people, people who don’t have any alternative. And of course, we know that Planned Parenthood has been under attack, constantly, from the Republicans, both in Congress, and in many states. And the Human Rights Campaign has been in the forefront of making sure that LGBT Americans are not discriminated against. They helped to lead the battle for marriage equality. I really don’t understand what he means by that. These are two of the really great human rights, progressive organizations in our country. I’ve worked with both of them a long time. I’ve worked to get results for the people that they represent and serve, and I’m proud to have endorsements from both of them. ” Anchor Wolf Blitzer then   “But are you the establishment?” Hillary answered, “I just don’t understand what that means. He’s been in Congress, he’s been elected to office a lot longer than I have. I was in the Senate for eight wonderful years, representing New York. He’s been in the Congress for 25. And so, I’ll let your viewers make their own judgment. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
