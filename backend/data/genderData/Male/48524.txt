’  ’ ’   Possibly the defining business trend coming out of the financial   crisis has been a ”startup boom.” Everyone is building an app or   starting their own business it seems. ’ ’   This image, however, may be just an illusion, according to   Michelle Meyer, US economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ’ ”   Both the formation of firms (for example, McDonald’s as a whole)   and establishments (an individual McDonald’s restaurant) have   dropped off precipitously since the financial crisis and remained   low. ” ”   This is important, according to Meyer, because new businesses   typically hire faster and produce higher levels of productivity   than firms that have been around for a while. Thus the decline in   business formation can explain some of the labor market’s   postrecession problems, and is at least part of the reason for   the steep drop in productivity. ” ’  ’ ”   Additionally, Meyer says, it can end up affecting the nation’s   gross domestic product. Here’s Meyer (emphasis added): ” ’   Meyer suggests four reasons for this depressing economic trend: ’ ’   It is not all doom and gloom, however, Meyer says. For one thing,   credit access has gotten considerably easier, allowing new   businesses to take out loans. Business confidence is also a   cyclical trend that can be reversed. ’ ’   On the other two, Meyer notes that technological disruptions can   cut both ways. Additionally, millennials are hitting ”prime age,”   which means they have the capital and experience to take on a   business venture themselves. ’ ’   ”Research from the Kauffman foundation discovered that the   average successful entrepreneur in   industries founded   their company when they were 40 years old,” the note said. ”With   the oldest millennial just turning 36, demographics should turn   supportive for new business formation in the medium term.” ’ ”   So it’s not pretty for now, but entrepreneurship isn’t dead in   America yet. ”
