Tuesday on “CBS This Morning,” while commenting on the terror attacks in Brussels at the Maalbeek Metro station and and Zaventem airport, which resulted in deaths of at least 31 and hundreds injured, the former CIA deputy director Michael Morell said the Brussels attack is a “big win” for the Islamic State (ISIS) which has now taken credit.  Morell said, “I think it’s more difficult to put together such a sophisticated network here. Just more difficult, but not impossible. I think we have to assume that ISIS is in the process of trying to build that network here, or maybe has already built it. So, I think we have to act on that and we have to believe that it’s a real possibility. ” He added, “We have picked up the intensity of the fight in Iraq and Syria after Paris. But what happened today in Brussels —  if it does indeed turn out to be ISIS —  this is a big victory for  them. We’re still not degrading ISIS enough to degrade their ability to attack us in the West. So this is a big win for them. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
