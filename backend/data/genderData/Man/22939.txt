Professional eater Joey “Jaws” Chestnut reclaimed the International Hot Dog Eating Contest title on Monday at the annual July Fourth Nathan’s Famous hot dog eating contest by shoving 70 hot dogs down his throat in 10 minutes, breaking his 2013 record of 69.  Finishing in second place was Matt Stonie with 53. Stonie won last year’s event, ending Chestnut’s eight straight victories. Chestnut will get to relish in his victory by holding onto the Mustard Yellow International Belt for the next year. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
