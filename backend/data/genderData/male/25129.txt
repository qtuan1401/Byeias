President Barack Obama reacted to the United Kingdom decision to exit the European Union, praising the globalist organization as an important force for change. [He celebrated the European Union as a political body that had “done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond. ”  But Obama signaled respect for the United Kingdom’s decision, even though he visited London in April to urge the country to stay in the EU. “The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision,” he adding that “the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring. ” Obama warned in April that the United States would put the UK in the “back of the queue” for trade talks if they decided to leave the EU. But he tried to call for global stability in spite of the shocking vote. “The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world,” he said. Obama is currently traveling in California, planning to deliver a speech at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit later today.
