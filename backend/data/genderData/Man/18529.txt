During the January 14 GOP Debate, presidential hopeful Ted Cruz sought to differentiate himself from the other candidates on the stage by suggesting his time in office has proven he does not just talk   rather, he is  . [Cruz said:  In any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane, that’s what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that, they recognize that people’s action don’t always match their words. Cruz then pointed to his record to show that he not only talks   but has fought for guns and gun rights while in office: I’ve got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment. There is reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There’s a reason the NRA gave me their   Freedom Fund award. And there’s a reason when Barack Obama and Senator Chuck Schumer ( ) came after our right to keep and bear arms that I led the opposition —  along with millions of Americans —  and we defeated gun control legislation. And I would note, the other individuals on this stage were no where to be found in that fight. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart. com.
