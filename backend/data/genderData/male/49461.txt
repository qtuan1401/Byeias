’  ’ ’   Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has been known to offer some   confusing analyses on his players and team. ’ ’   The latest came after Dak Prescott helped lead the Cowboys to a     win over the Washington Redskins in Week 12. ’ ’   Seemingly discussing Prescott’’s 39 rushing yards and rushing   touchdown against Washington, Jones remarked, ”You see him run by   a secondary player, and then he puts that stiff arm, you quit   worrying about him. He’’s the daddy.” ’ ”   When asked about Jones’ comments, however, Prescott was not so   sure about the meaning. ” ’   ”I don’’t know what that means,” Prescott told reporters. ’ ’   ”I have no kids. Don’’t want any,” Prescott added. ’ ”   It’s certainly not the first time this season Jones’ comments   have confused the NFL world. Back in September, Jones was asked   about who the Cowboys would play at quarterback when Tony Romo   returned from injury, and he said the team wouldn’t need to spend   time  ” ’   The Cowboys are rolling at   winners of ten straight, so   Jones can say all of the confusing things he wants.
