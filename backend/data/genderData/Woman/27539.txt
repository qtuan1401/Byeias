Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor famously hates it when people have cell phones glued to their hands during concerts  —   so maybe it’s no surprise that the singer slapped a cell phone right out of a texting fan’s hand during a recent show. [The band’s official Twitter account shared footage of the incident on Sunday:  pic. twitter.   —   Slipknot (@slipknot) July 10, 2016,  The    singer also addressed the incident on his own personal Twitter account: If you’re gonna text, stay home.  https:  .   —   Jalapeno Throat, LLC (@CoreyTaylorRock) July 10, 2016,  Right on man. It’s actually   afterward, the dude TOTALLY understood the fuck up and we laughed together haha. https:  .   —   Jalapeno Throat, LLC (@CoreyTaylorRock) July 10, 2016,  Fair enough. But you might wanna do it between sets or between songs. Am I right? https:  .   —   Jalapeno Throat, LLC (@CoreyTaylorRock) July 10, 2016,  Okay. But it doesn’t mean I   a broken neck  still playing a show can’t get pissed that someone’s ignoring it. https:  .   —   Jalapeno Throat, LLC (@CoreyTaylorRock) July 10, 2016,  The singer apparently took some flak online over the incident and responded to critics on Monday morning: In response to the negative feedback regarding the Phone Incident, I’ve prepared a written statement: pic. twitter.   —   Jalapeno Throat, LLC (@CoreyTaylorRock) July 11, 2016,  HAHAHAHAHAHA please see the AMENDED statement 😜 pic. twitter.   —   Jalapeno Throat, LLC (@CoreyTaylorRock) July 11, 2016,  Taylor does not like cell phones at his band’s concerts in 2014, he told radio station WRIF that he tries to pour water bottles on fans who can’t put down their phones. “People need to unplug and realize that they’re missing their lives, dude. It’s sad,” he said then. “And that may be me just being an old jerk, but I don’t care. I don’t care. Truth is truth it doesn’t matter what age you’re at. ” Taylor isn’t the only performer who’s easily peeved by distracted  . British pop star Adele recently stopped a concert in Italy to berate a woman for filming her performance.  “I want to tell that lady as well, can you stop filming me with a video camera?” Adele said at a concert in May. “Because I’m really here in real life, you can enjoy it in real life, rather than through your camera. ” Both stars may soon be in luck. Apple has reportedly developed technology that will block cell phone users from filming any action taking place on a concert stage (or any other stage) with   infrared beams.
