In a web extra portion of President Barack Obama’s interview with “Fox News Sunday,” the president discussed his belief that America needs to reach out to Muslims to win the war on terror.  Obama said, “We are talking about a tiny fraction of fanatics and killers who are not representative  of over a billion Muslims around the world. For us to defeat them we have to enlist all those other Muslims, all these other countries, our own Muslim American communities, many of whom severed in our armed forces and are outstanding citizens our neighbors, our friends. We have to make sure they are working with us. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
