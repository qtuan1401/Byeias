Mark Krikorian, Executive Director, Center for Immigration Studies spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday regarding the recent budget deal, which lacks border wall funding. [Asked what he thought of the border security issue as addressed by the budget deal, Krikorian said, “I think it was a surrender on the part of the president. There’s a good reason that Schumer and Pelosi are crowing about how they won on this because they did. ”  While discussing the immigration issue in depth, added Krikorian, “There is the sense that in a lot of ways on immigration, the White House is now betraying people who supported him. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
