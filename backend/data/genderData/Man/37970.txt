 (CNN) Ray Weser is 101 years old, soon to be 102. If living for more than a century isn’t cool enough, he’s also a veteran and a   Harley Davidson lover. (He even worked for the company for 24 years.) The open road isn’t always easy on someone so up in years, but on Sunday, Weser got to show his    spirit one more time.  Members of a local VFW in Prescott Valley, Arizona, and the Grand Canyon   dealership teamed up to send Weser on an epic last ride.  Set up on the back of a   trike, Weser was joined by about 50 other riders as they tooled around Prescott Valley, engines humming and smiles shining.  Weser told CNN affiliate KPHO he started working on motorcycles as a teen, and the rest is easy history. ”Harley dripping oil, smoke coming out of everywhere and I fell in love with motorcycles right there! ,” he said. Weser’s granddaughter told KPHO that, with this weekend’s ride, his life has come full circle.
