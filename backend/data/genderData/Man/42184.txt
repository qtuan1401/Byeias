 (CNN) It’s a nightmare many of us know all too well.  You find yourself stood in front of your classmates at graduation, or your colleagues for that big presentation, only to look down and discover that you’ve left the house in only your underwear. Well imagine doing that     at one of tennis’ four grand slams in the full glare of the media as Stan Wawrinka did over a fortnight. Read: Wawrinka stuns to Djokovic to clinch French Open crown, Undeterred, the Swiss composed himself to produce arguably a string of the finest performances of his career, culminating in Sunday’s French Open final win over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. Once he’d secured his first Roland Garros title, talk immediately turned to the pair of red, white and gray plaid shorts that launched countless tweets and inspired at least two parody accounts on Twitter. Not surprisingly Wawrinka seemed grateful for the part his shorts had played in one of the biggest wins of his career, proudly displaying them as he faced the assembled media. ”It will be in the museum of Roland Garros,” he explained. ”You will see my shorts every day if you want. Everybody talks about the shorts. I quite like them. Apparently I’m the only one.” Off the court, it’s been a tough year for the    who separated from his wife Ilham in April.  ”You have to make sacrifices,” he said after his win over Djokovic, which has propelled him up to fourth in the rankings. ”You have to work out, to be relaxed in your mind, to focus on what you’re doing. I’m still surprised that in two months I can win the French Open, because I wasn’t in good shape.  ”It was a tough, tough moment for me. To say that now I won the French Open, it’s something completely crazy.” But with a second grand slam title on the mantlepiece, and a pair of shorts in the wardrobe of tennis history, things are looking up for the new Swiss No. 1.
