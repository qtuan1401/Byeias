An improvised device exploded in a garbage receptacle near the course of a charity race that was about to begin in a small town on the Jersey Shore on Saturday, law enforcement officials said. The device went off around 9:30 a. m. near the boardwalk in Seaside Park, N. J. according to the Ocean County sheriff, Mike Mastronardy. There were no injuries, and officials do not believe that anyone was near the explosion when it happened. It did not damage any buildings either, officials said. The race, the Seaside Semper Five, a   run and charity event along the waterfront that raises money for members of the United States Marine Corps and their families, was canceled. The race was scheduled to start around 9 a. m. but it had been delayed because of a large turnout of around 3, 000 people, according to Al Della Fave, the spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor’s office. “That delay helped tremendously in terms of what could have been,” he told reporters. Ben Currie, 39, a photographer, said he was on the beach a few blocks away taking pictures of the ocean when the explosion happened. “It was so loud, it made my knees buckle. All the birds went flying off the beach,” he said. “A black plume of smoke, about 25 feet high, rose. ” Officials evacuated the area and urged people to avoid Seaside Park. The authorities do not believe there were additional explosions or devices, according to the New Jersey State Police. “However, State Police bomb technicians have rendered safe items located in the same trash can in which the explosion occurred,” the police said in a statement. Investigators from the State Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene. “We are grateful that nobody was injured, but this is a serious act of violence against the people of New Jersey,” the New Jersey attorney general, Christopher S. Porrino, said in a statement.
