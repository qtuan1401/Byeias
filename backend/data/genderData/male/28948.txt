Sunday on Fox News Channel’s breaking news coverage of the shootings in Baton Rouge, LA, that has killed three officers and injured three more, Cleveland police officer and Police Patrolmen’s Association President Steve Loomis said President Barack Obama has “blood on his hands. ”  Loomis said, “The president of the Untied States validated a false narrative and the nonsense that Black Lives Matter and the media are pressing out there to the public  —   validated with his very divisive statements. And now we see an escalation. This has got to end. We need some leadership in this country to come forward and put an end to this. I don’t care if it’s clergy, I don’t care who it is, but somebody has got to step up and put an end to this because it’s the false narrative and very influential people that are politicizing the false narrative. Absolutely insane that we have a president of the United States and a governor of Minnesota making the statements that they made less than one day after those police involved shootings. And those police involved shootings, make no mistake, are what absolutely has triggered this rash of senseless murders of law enforcement officers across this country. It is reprehensible. And the President of the United States has blood on his hands and it will not be able to come washed off. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
