Thursday on The Blaze TV, host Glenn Beck told his listeners why he is campaigning for Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and he urged them to do the same because if America goes away, the blood will be on their hands.  Beck said, “I’m going to be in Arizona and Utah for the campaign and I’m doing it because that’s what I can do. Others can do whatever it is you do. But even if it’s one person, you be bold. We are on the Titanic, it’s going down. Knock on every single door. They don’t want to come? Fine. Don’t waste time. The Titanic is going down. But you knock on every single door —  ’Can I tell you about the truth? Can I tell you about the truth? Can I tell you about the truth, because here’s what’s coming, here’s what’s coming.’ They don’t want to hear it, up to them. But remember what Ezekiel said. Ezekiel said you will be held responsible. This is the thing no one understands from religious people. ” “I just don’t get it,” he continued. “Too much —  we have been given much. Much is required. Required, not expected, required. Beyond that, Ezekiel talks about these times and says basically everyone in their own way, you are a watchman on the tower, you are a watchman at the gate. And the blood of the people who could have been saved —  now think of this —  because we’re talking about the rights of all mankind. If America goes down —  this isn’t hyperbole any more, this isn’t like a famous Reagan speech that he gave —  this is real. If we go away, where is freedom? So all of the freedom that will be lost, all of lives that will be lost because we refused to pay attention —  on our hands. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
