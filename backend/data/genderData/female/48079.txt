Some economists,   including Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, had  that   buyers might be   contributing to the price increase. ’ ’   ”It will be interesting to see how prices respond,” Ashworth   wrote, regarding the tax. ”Our guess is that it will affect   prices for a month or two, but we still believe this is mostly a     bubble and, with interest rates only going   lower, prices will rebound later this year.” ’ ’   In any case, Ashworth also argued that the recent dip in the       ratio could also   indicate that the housing market has ”peaked.” ’ ’   ”Overall, we might be close to peak crazy in the housing market,”   he wrote. ”The   in home sales over the past couple of   months suggests that the pace of house price appreciation will   begin to moderate later this year.” ’
