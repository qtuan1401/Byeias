The FDA has opened up a criminal investigation into a video appearing to show a man urinating on an assembly line at a Kellogg facility in Memphis, TN, according to a report by Fox5.  The video, uploaded Friday to the site WorldStarHipHop. com, was found to have been recorded in 2014. It reportedly could have affected Rice Krispies Treats, Rice Krispies Treats cereal and puffed rice cake products. All would have passed their expiration date by now. It is believed that the video was shot during a labor dispute between Kellogg’s and employees who were locked out. Kellogg spokesman Kris Charles released the following statement: “Kellogg takes this situation very seriously and we were shocked and deeply disappointed by this video that we just learned of yesterday,” a statement from the company said. “We immediately alerted law enforcement authorities and regulators. A criminal investigation is underway as well as a thorough internal investigation. ” “Food quality is of the utmost importance to Kellogg Company. We are outraged by this completely unacceptable situation, and we will work closely with authorities to prosecute to the full extent of the law. ” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
