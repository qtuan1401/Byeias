’  ’ ’   Hurricane Matthew, now making its way through the upper Caribbean   toward Florida, could strike the state twice if certain models   turn out to be accurate. ’ ’   The storm,  is expected to   make landfall early on Friday and then turn out to sea Saturday   and Sunday. After that point, the projections are   looking more than three days in the future, when weather   models tend to get pretty hazy, as a general rule. ’ ”   But, as Jason Samenow of the Washington Post  one major model (known as GFS) predicts Matthew will   inscribe a full circle off the coast before returning to strike   Florida again later next week. This GIF from the Post’s Capital   Weather Gang illustrates the possibility: ” ’ ’ ” ’t’t’tCould Florida get hit twice by the same storm? Some models say it’s possible, including the GFS:   ” ”   Part of what’s happening here is that Tropical Storm Nicole, hot   on Matthew’s heels, has the potential to interfere with the   larger storm’s route. You can see it approaching from the East in   the above animation. ” ’  ’ ’   As Samenow reports, it’’s very difficult to predict exactly how   tropical cyclones will interact with one another, especially so   far into the future. But typically they either repel one another   or ”orbit” one another due to an phenomenon known as the   ” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
