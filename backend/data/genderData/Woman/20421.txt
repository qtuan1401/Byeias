Wednesday on the “Hugh Hewitt Show,” Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson said Democrats play the race card “anytime they don’t get their way like little children having a temper tantrum. ”  Hewitt played a clip of  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accusing Republicans of “talking in coded racial language” and demonizing President Barack Obama to “encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe. ” When Hewitt asked Carson if she spoke in “coded racial language,” Carson said, “Well, I mean, I think she does. And you know, they’re always going to bring up the race issue anytime they don’t get their way like little children having a temper tantrum. It’s kind of comical, quite frankly. And you know, if everything is racial, why aren’t they saying that any problems that I have are because of racial prejudice? You know, why does it always only go in one direction. That makes no sense. ”
