Gab founder and CEO Andrew Torba was temporarily banned from Facebook last night after sharing a link to Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ Dangerous Faggot tour trailer just hours before his event at Texas Tech university. [Torba documented the temporary suspension from Facebook on Twitter and Gab, relaying his confusion as to the reason of his ban and the removal of the post, which purely consisted of a link to the video and the comment, “Wew lads  …     Coming to college campuses everywhere. Release the frogs. ”  BREAKING: Facebook just censored my post that contained Milo’s Tour Trailer. WOW. Didn’t even ask, just pulled it. pic. twitter.   —   🐸The Gabfather🐸 (@torbahax) September 13, 2016,  Well folks, it’s happening.  They are shutting me up.  24 hour ban. https:  .   🐸 #SpeakFreely pic. twitter.   —   🐸The Gabfather🐸 (@torbahax) September 13, 2016,  “I shared a link to Milo’s new tour trailer on Facebook hours before his first live show. About an hour before the show at Texas Tech, Milo started actively posting on Gab promoting it. During the livestream I went to check my Facebook only to find that I was logged out. When I logged back in, I was told the link to Milo’s trailer had been removed for me because it broke community guidelines,” Torba told Breitbart Tech. “I was not told which guidelines and was not given the choice to remove the content myself. Instead it was removed for me. I decided to test and see what was really   my copy above the link or the link itself,” he explained. “I shared the video link again, and this time within minutes I was locked out of my account, the content automatically removed, and a 24 hour ban notice for being a bad boy and sharing a harmless promotional video. ” Though Torba’s post was simply removed the first time he shared it, it was the second time he attempted to share the video that he was handed a temporary suspension.
