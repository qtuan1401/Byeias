ESPN fired Curt Schilling for saying men are men and women are women and they ought to use the bathroom that corresponds to their sex. [However, ESPN was far more forgiving of one of its anchors eight years ago who insulted Christianity using a profanity that can’t even be used on the sports network.  On January 11, 2008, ESPN anchor Dana Jacobson launched an   tirade at an Atlantic City ESPN roast, including the phrase “f**k Jesus. ” According to a Christian Post article, “She was reportedly intoxicated during the incident, talking vulgarly about Jesus and a colleague’s alma mater, Notre Dame. ” An Atlantic City paper reported at the time that Jacobson was “swilling vodka from a Belvedere bottle, mumbling along and cursing like a sailor. ” ESPN said at the time, “Her actions and comments were inappropriate and we’ve dealt with it. ” ESPN “dealt with” the   slur by suspending the employee for a week. Former major league pitching ace Curt Schilling says that men in dresses ought not to pee in the women’s room. That caused a firestorm of criticism from the sexual left. It demanded his firing, and ESPN complied. Reverend Pat Mahoney, who led a protest against ESPN over Jacobson, pointed out that “eight years ago ESPN sports announcer, Dana Jacobson, said ‘F**k Jesus’ at an ESPN event. We called for her to be fired for her bigoted and hateful comments. Her punishment was a week’s suspension. Fast forward to Curt Shilling being fired for making remarks about the transgender community on social media. My question to ESPN is, don’t you think saying ‘F**k Jesus’ is as offensive as what Shilling did?”
