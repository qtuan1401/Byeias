Former New York Police Department Commissioner Bernard Kerik argued Sunday that the FBI investigators must have taken just over one second to review each email in order to clear Hillary Clinton of criminal activity in under nine days. [In a tweet, Bernard Kerik revealed what appears to be the statistical impossibility of the FBI’s investigation, given that there are 691, 200 seconds in 8 days, (the time since the FBI began their investigation,) meaning that they reviewed each email in just over a second.  There are 691, 200 seconds in 8 days. FBI Director Comey reviewed 650, 000 emails in 8 days? An email per second? Americans aren’t stupid!  —   Bernard B. Kerik (@BernardKerik) November 6, 2016,  Meanwhile former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, General Michael Flynn, pointed out that it took the FBI over a year to review 60, 000 emails before Clinton was cleared back in July, yet having found new evidence on a server with 650, 000 emails, it took just eight days. It took 1 year to review 60K and 8 days to review 650K? Smart machines or not, something does not jive. Thoughts?  —   General Flynn (@GenFlynn) November 6, 2016,  The calculation would only apply if investigators had been working for 24 hours a day consecutively since they began the investigation. Since this is highly unlikely, it is more likely that each emails was reviewed in well under a second. One possible explanation for the speed of the investigation is that the FBI used smart machines that honed in on relevant emails, meaning they quickly excluded the emails of Hillary Clinton’s aid Huma Abedin and managed to focus on what could be incriminating material. The announcement to clear Hillary Clinton comes just two days before Tuesday’s presidential election. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com.
