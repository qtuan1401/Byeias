On January 8 —  three days after President Obama announced his executive gun controls —  a poll from Rasmussen Reports showed that a clear majority of voters oppose “Obama’s decision to go it alone with several gun control initiatives. ”[According to Rasmussen, “58 percent of likely U. S. voters say the government should only do what the president and Congress agree on when it comes to gun control. ” Moreover, Rasmussen reports that 59 percent of voters “say the additional oversight will not reduce the number of [the] shootings” Obama referenced to justify passing gun control in the first place.  Rasmussen also found that voters oppose more gun control in America by a margin of 50 percent to 45 percent. The Rasmussen percentages are similar to a   poll released at start of Obama’s January 7 gun control town hall on CNN. Unlike the Rasmussen poll, the   poll showed the opinions of Americans in general —  not just voters. It showed that 54 percent of Americans oppose Obama’s executive actions for gun control. Moreover, the   poll showed that 57 percent of Americans believe Obama’s executive controls “will NOT be effective in reducing the number of   deaths in the United States. ” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
