A fisherman kayaking in the Pacific Ocean near Los Angeles caught a leopard shark  —   and soon found himself in a fierce    with a great white shark. [“I had the camera in one hand and I had the shark in the other hand   …     I had to move my arm back and forth like a piston so that it wouldn’t just pull me over,” Bill Morales told local San   affiliate KTLA.   Great white sharks are not uncommon along the Southern California coast, though it is usually the juveniles that feed nearby, with adult sharks venturing further out to sea. Last year, a hammerhead shark bit another kayaker in deep water off the coast of Malibu. Leopard sharks are endemic to the shallow waters near Los Angeles in the Santa Monica Bay, and are harmless. In recent months, other shark species, such as basking sharks, have been seen near Los Angeles, thanks to warmer waters in the eastern Pacific caused by the El Niño phenomenon.
