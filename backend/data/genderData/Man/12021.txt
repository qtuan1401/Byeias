Hundreds of Turkish migrants and dual nationals turned out onto the streets of Rotterdam to riot in support of their home country’s Islamist president last night, forcing Dutch police to take robust action to disperse them.[  People wave Turkish national flags during a demonstration near the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam on March 11, 2017.

All the values Europe stands for  —   freedom, democracy, human rights  —   are incompatible with Islam,” he said. “Turkey voted for Erdoğan, a dangerous Islamist who raises the flag of Islam. We do not want more, but less Islam. So Turkey, stay away from us. You are not welcome here. ” Aggressive crowds have gathered outside the Dutch embassy in Ankara and the consulate in Istanbul in response, calling for retaliation and chanting “Allahu Akbar!” Nu voor Nederlands consulaat in Istanbul pic. twitter.   —   Lucas Waagmeester (@NOSWaagmeester) March 11, 2017,  The riots are in response to the Dutch government’s refusal to allow the Turkish foreign minister to land in the Netherlands to attend a rally supporting the expansion of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s powers.  According to Prime Minister Mark Rutte, the refusal was made in response to being threatened with sanctions. “We can never do business under this kind of blackmail,” said Rutte, expressing amazement that family affairs minster Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya attempted to circumvent the Dutch ban on Turkish politicians campaigning in the Netherlands by bringing a fleet of ministerial cars across the German border, which the European Union’s borderless Schengen Area leaves unprotected. “We drew a red line,” he said, explaining why Kaya was escorted back to the German border  —   a move which prompted Erdoğan to denounce the Dutch as “fascists” and “Nazi remnants”.
