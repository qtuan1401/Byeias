.@TuckerCarlson: The point isn’t just that the Clinton Foundation is corrupt   it’s a bad charity. It’s a scam. https:  .  On Wednesday’s “Fox  Friends,” network regular and Daily Caller editor Tucker Carlson weighed in on the Clinton Foundation’s tax returns showing the charity donated only $9 million of the $140 million in grants and pledges in the year 2013.  Carlson said the Clinton Foundation is not only corrupt, but is an “ineffective” and “bad charity” altogether. He said, “Out of $140 million, according to their tax returns, $9 million went to direct grants. So the point isn’t simply that it’s corrupt, it’s that it’s ineffective. It’s a bad charity. If you had a choice between giving to the Clinton Foundation or the tens of thousands of other charities around the world, why would you give to that one, which has a less reliable rate of helping people than almost any other I’ve ever heard of before. It’s a scam. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
