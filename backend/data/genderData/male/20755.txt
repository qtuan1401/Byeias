A Texas sheriff’s deputy and his wife opened fire on two black males after they assaulted the   officer at a gas station. [The deputy was in plain clothes at the time and had a four wheeler hitched to his truck. He and his wife were headed to their deer lease, according to the Montgomery County Police Reporter.  The reported attack occurred after the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office deputy walked out of a Shell Station at Sorters and Summer Hills roads in Montgomery County, Texas. The two black males allegedly assaulted him, taking him to the ground and started kicking him in the head. The suspects were apparently trying to rob the officer because they tried to get his wallet. The deputy’s wife was armed and she exited the vehicle and discharged several shots at the suspects as they were running towards a red Chevrolet truck. The deputy went to get his pistol and also opened fire.  Engle reported that the red truck was recovered by Houston Police Department officers in northeast Houston. The truck had been carjacked a few days earlier while the owner was still in it. Law enforcement officials with the Montgomery County crime lab have the truck and are combing it for fingerprints and DNA samples. The deputy was taken to the hospital and later released. He has lacerations to his face, a broken jaw, and several missing teeth, reported the Police Reporter. He will undergo corrective surgery in the near future. The suspects remain at large but anyone with information about their whereabouts or witnessed the incident has been asked to call the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office.
