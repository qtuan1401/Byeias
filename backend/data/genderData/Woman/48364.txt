’  ’ ” There’s no telling how many guns we have in America —  and when   one gets used in a crime, no way for the cops to connect it to   its owner. ” ’ The only place the police can turn for help is a Kafkaesque   agency in West Virginia, where, thanks to the gun lobby,   computers are illegal and detective work is absurdly antiquated.   On purpose. ’ ’ Thing is, the geniuses who work there are quietly inventing   ways to do the impossible. ’ ”     Say there’s a murder. Blood everywhere, a dead guy on the     floor. The cops come in with their yellow tape, chalk line, the     little booties, cameras, swabs, the fingerprint dust. One of     them finds a gun on the floor. The gun! He lifts it with his     pinkie, examines it, takes note of the serial number. Back at     the station, they run a trace on the gun. A name pops up. It’s     the wife! Or: It’s the business partner! It’s somebody’s gun,     and this is so exciting because now they know who did it.   ” ”     Except —  no. You are watching too much TV. It doesn’t work like     that.   ” ”     “Think,” says Charlie Houser, a federal agent with the     ATF. We’re in his office, a corner, and he’s got a whiteboard     behind him where he’s splashed diagrams, charts, numbers.   ” ”     The cops run a trace on a gun? What does that even mean? A name     pops up? From where? There’s some master list somewhere? Like,     for all the guns all over the world, there’s a master list that     started with the No. 1 (when? World War I? Civil War? Russian     Revolution? when?) and in the year 2016 we are now up     to No. 14 gazillion whatever, and every single one of those     serial numbers has a gun owner’s name attached to it on some     giant list somewhere (where?) which, thank God, a big computer     is keeping track of?   ” ”     “People don’t think,” Charlie tells me. He’s a trim guy, 51,     full lips and a thin goatee, and he likes to wear       suits. They fit loose, so the overall effect is awkward     innocence, like an eighth grader headed to his first formal.     “ I get   even from police saying, ‘Can you type     in the serial number and tell me who the gun is registered to?’     Every week. They think it’s like a VIN number on a car. Even     police. Police from everywhere. ‘Hey, can you guys hurry up and     type that number in?’ ”   ” ”       So here’s a news flash, from Charlie: “We ain’t got a       registration system. Ain’t nobody registering no damn guns. ”     ” ’       There is no national database of guns. We have no centralized       record of who owns all the firearms we so vigorously debate,       no hard data regarding how many people own them, how many of       them are bought or sold, or how many even exist.     ’ ’       What we have instead is Charlie.     ’ ’         “Can I go smoke a cigarette while we discuss it?”       ’ ’         Anytime a cop in any jurisdiction in America wants to         connect a gun to its owner, the request for help ends up         here, at the National Tracing Center, in a low, flat,         boring building that belies its past as an IRS facility,         just off state highway 9 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in         the eastern panhandle of the state, a town of some 17, 000         people, a Walmart, a JCPenney, and various dollar stores         sucking the life out of a quaint redbrick downtown. On any         given day, agents here are running about 1, 500 traces; they         do about 370, 000 a year.       ’ ’  ’ ”           “It’s a shoestring budget,” says Charlie, who runs the           center. “It’s not 10, 000 agents and a big sophisticated           place. It’s a bunch of friggin’ boxes. All             records. We have about 50 ATF employees. And all the rest           are basically the ladies. The ladies that live in West           Virginia —  and they got a job. There’s a huge amount of           labor being put into looking through microfilm. ”         ” ”           I want to ask about the microfilm —  microfilm? —  but           it’s hard to get a word in. He’s already gone three           rounds on the whiteboard, scribbling, erasing,           illustrating some of the finer points of gun tracing, of           which there are many, in large part due to the           limitations imposed upon this place. For example, no           computer. The National Tracing Center is not allowed to           have centralized computer data.         ” ”           “That’s the big ” says Charlie.         ” ”           That’s been a federal law, thanks to the NRA, since 1986:           No searchable database of America’s gun owners. So people           here have to use paper, sort through enormous stacks of           forms and record books that gun stores are required to           keep and to eventually turn over to the feds when           requested. It’s kind of like a library in the old           days —  but without the card catalog. They can use pictures           of paper, like microfilm (they recently got the             to convert the microfilm to PDFs) as long as the           pictures of paper are not searchable. You have to flip           through and read. No searching by gun owner. No searching           by name.         ” ”           “Okay?” Charlie’s tapping a box of Winston Reds. His           smile is impish, like he’s daring you to say what needs           to be said: This is a fucking nightmare.         ” ’  Yeah, but a million a month?  ’ ’  ’ ’             “These were Hurricane Katrina,” he says, leaning             against a stack. “They were all submerged. They came in             wet. And then we dried them in the parking lot. When             they got dry enough, the ladies ran them into the             imager.           ’ ”             “Do you want to see the imagers? I’ll show you. Imaging             is like running a copy machine. So, like, if there’s             staples? So what these ladies along here do, from this             wall to this wall, from six in the morning until             midnight  …    staples. ”           ” ”             It’s hard to tell if he’s complaining, or bragging.           ” ”             “All this, everywhere, all these hallways, the boxes,”             he says. “We’ve been as high as 15, 000 boxes             backlogged. When we go over 10, 000, the General             Services Administration dudes are walking around going,             ‘We’ll collapse the floor.’           ” ”             “And then Denise says —  did you meet Denise? Denise says,             ‘Let’s get some shipping containers! They’re like 70             bucks a month to rent.’ So we put shipping containers             out in the parking lot here. ” He pushes open a heavy             metal door and there they are, three red, one orange,             and one blue, pinged with rust, sitting on the hot             asphalt with weeds popping through. “See, now we fill             these up. Um  …    ” He yanks the latch on the orange one,             bends his knees as he heaves open the door. Inside it’s             the same as the corridors: boxes. “Maybe 50 times a day             a trace will come in for gun records in those boxes.             Right? So, 50 times today somebody will be out here               boxes because we don’t have them imaged             yet.           ” ’             “You want to go see the microfilm archive?”           ’ ”             But why shouldn’t a gun be like a car —  or food? If you             need to know the history, you call a number and             somebody’s got the information. If we have an E.             colioutbreak, we don’t have much trouble getting             to the offending bags of lettuce.           ” ”               Guns don’t work that way.             ” ”               The last time Congress seriously addressed the notion               of creating a way to keep track of America’s guns was               1968. Back then, assassination was the thing. First               President Kennedy, then Martin Luther King Jr. then               Robert Kennedy. The outcry was nearly identical to               the one we have now: too many guns, too few               regulations, too many crazy people shooting with               abandon.             ” ”               The Gun Control Act of 1968 was an attempt to impose               order. It set up the Federal Firearms License (FFL)               system; gun stores would have to become licensed and               they would have to follow certain rules. Felons,               illegal immigrants, and crazy people would be               prohibited from buying guns. People would have to               sign a document, Federal Form 4473, also called the               Firearms Transaction Record, swearing that they were               none of these things. (Background checks to prove you               weren’t didn’t come until 1993.)             ” ”               President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the act into               law, was at once jubilant and depressed. He had               wanted the law to establish a national gun registry,               too, but Congress wouldn’t agree to that part. “If               the criminal with a gun is to be tracked down               quickly, then we must have registration in this               country,” Johnson said. “The voices that blocked               these safeguards were not the voices of an aroused               nation. They were the voices of a powerful lobby, a               gun lobby, that has prevailed for the moment in an               election year. ”             ” ”               It was the same conversation we’re still               having —  except now mass shootings are the thing. We               average at least one a month. Since 1968, more               Americans have died from gunfire than have died in               all our wars put together. In 2014: 33, 599.             ” ”               Who’s doing all the shooting and where are they               getting all those guns and how many do they have and               can’t we get control over this clusterfuck? Wouldn’t               a national gun registry give us a tool to stop some               of the killing?             ” ”               No, says the gun lobby. It would give the government               a tool to confiscate our guns. The idea of a gun               registry is the great fever dream that lies at the               heart of   conspiracy theories: Government               evildoers are going to attack us any day now. We have               to be ready. (And you don’t give the enemy an               inventory of all your weapons!)             ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ”                 In 1984, Form 4473 even showed up in a movie,                 Red Dawn. Soviet paratroopers invaded                 Colorado, and they went on a search for gun owners                 by getting their hands on a bunch of 4473s. “I’ll                 give you my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead                 hands,” was a popular NRA bumper sticker at the                 time and a variant was featured prominently in the                 movie.               ” ”                 It would be reasonable to assume, as many people                 do, that since 4473 is a federal form, the feds                 have them all locked up somewhere safe, but they                 don’t. They are kept at the store that sold the                 gun; only when the retailer goes out of business do                 the gun records come here to the tracing center,                 which accounts for Charlie’s box problem. Those are                 just the    records he’s dealing with                 in the corridors and the shipping containers in the                 parking lot.               ” ’“Those are just the                    records,” repeats Charlie, for emphasis.               ’ ”                 The vast majority of the gun records linking a gun                 to its owner are kept back at the various licensed                 dealers, the Walmarts, Bob’s Gun Shops, and Guns R                 Us stores dotting America’s landscape.               ” ”                 We have more gun retailers in America than we do                 supermarkets, more than 55, 000 of them. We’re                 talking nearly four times the number of McDonald’s.                 Nobody knows how many guns that equals, but in                 2013, U. S. gun manufacturers rolled out 10, 844, 792                 guns, and we imported an additional 5, 539, 539. The                 numbers were equally astounding the year before,                 and the year before that, and the year before that.               ” ”                   Matching a firearm to a person —  tracing a gun —  is                   therefore a     proposition that                   depends on Form 4473. To the people at the                   tracing center, locating that document is the                   whole object of the game. It’s the holy grail.                   The form has the gun purchaser’s signature on it,                   his or her address, place and date of birth,                   height, weight, gender, ethnicity, race, and,                   sometimes, Social Security number (“Optional, but                   will help prevent misidentification,” says box                   8).                 ” ”                   It’s a jackpot of information that could help                   solve a murder case, or exonerate an innocent guy                   on death row, or, as happens frequently, open                   unexpected investigative leads.                 ” ”                   Last December two gunmen opened fire at a holiday                   office party in San Bernardino, California,                   killing 14 people. Remember: Nobody knew who                   these maniacs were or why they were doing this.                   After a   the cops recovered a Smith                   & Wesson handgun, a Llama handgun, a Smith                   & Wesson M&P assault rifle, and a DPMS                   Panther Arms assault rifle. At the National                   Tracing Center, they figured out where the guns                   came from, as well as who bought them —  the slain                   assailants. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife,                   Tashfeen Malik, had purchased the handguns                   legally between three and eight years previously                   at Annie’s Get Your Gun, an FFL in Corona,                   California. Farook and Malik were discovered to                   have posted an oath of allegiance to the Islamic                   State on Facebook just before the attack began.                   But what about the assault rifles —  they were still                   a mystery. Turned out a former neighbor, Enrique                   Marquez, bought those during the same time                   period. The FBI picked up Marquez, who is alleged                   to have been plotting attacks with Farook at                   Riverside City College and on state highway 91 as                   early as 2011. Remember: We didn’t know too much                   about radicalized homegrown jihadists until then.                 ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’                     So, take that murder we began with. Blood all                     over the place, cops looking for clues, the                     booties. They find the gun! What happens next                     does not involve the wizardry of some                     supercomputer somewhere. It hinges on a phone                     call.                   ’ ”                     That cop with the gun dangling from his pinkie.                     He dials the tracing center and describes the                     gun. This is Step One. Let’s say, for example,                     he reports that he’s got a                         Beretta 92.                   ” ”                     This would seem to be a straightforward matter.                     It’s not. Cops are bad at describing guns. This                     is because many guns look alike and the nuances                     can be fantastically minute and critical to a                     successful trace.                   ” ”                     “You don’t think of Egypt making pistols, but                     they make a knockoff of the Beretta,” ATF                     specialist Scott Hester tells me. He’s a slim                     guy with a ruddy complexion in a black ATF polo                     shirt. He’s been tracing guns for a decade.                     We’re in his cubicle, and I can’t help but                     marvel at all the horrible newspaper clippings                     he’s got hanging everywhere, including one on                     the San Bernardino case, for which he and his                     team won an award. “I did Tucson. Pick a                     shooting. Pick a gun crime,” he tells me. “Pick                     whatever you want —  a firearm event that’s any                     type —  and one of us here has done it. That’s                     just the nature of what we do. Triple homicide                     here. Six killed here. Triple homicide there.                     Murder here. Boston Marathon there. I mean. .. ”                   ” ”                     He’s holding a hefty book, one of his favorite                     gun encyclopedias, and he would like to tell me                     about the Beretta 92 and its various                     doppelgängers. “Now, the real Beretta’s made in                     Italy,” he says, “but Taurus is made in Brazil.                     So you have the Beretta 92 and Taurus PT 92.                     They’re the exact same gun except the safety’s                     on the slide on one and on the frame of the                     other. ” I want to tell him it doesn’t matter —  I                     was just picking any random gun so he could                     walk me through the steps about how to trace                     it —  but it occurs to me that his entire career                     is built on the premise that, yes, it                     matters. “Now, Beretta was licensing its                     stuff in Brazil,” he goes on, “but Taurus                     bought it out, so they bought up                     Brazil —  Beretta’s factory in Brazil —  and licensed                     it as Taurus. ” He’s pointing to a page in the                     book, tapping hard as if the force of the tap                     will make this any easier to follow.                   ” ”                       “Now, they’re almost identical                       guns,” he says proudly, like a math professor                       who just reached the most obviously correct                       answer, “but from different parts of the                       planet!”                     ” ”                       It takes a guy working here for a decade to                       know stuff like this. The   attitude is                       comforting. It’s encouraging to know people                       here are so wildly invested in conquering                       this chaos.                     ” ”                         So, okay, not a Beretta 92, and not an                         Egyptian knockoff, but a Taurus PT 92 made                         in Beretta’s factory in Brazil. Let’s say                         that’s our gun. What’s the next step in                         tracing it back to its original purchaser?                       ” ’                         “I need the serial number,” Hester says. He                         lifts his shoulders in an exaggerated shrug                         and lets out an ominous sigh.                       ’ ’                         Serial numbers: not so simple. “It gets                         worse and worse, more and more                         problematic. ”                       ’ ”                         Serial numbers, it turns out, are tangled                         clogs of hell. Half the time what the cop                         is reading you is the patent number, not                         the serial number, or it’s the ID of the                         importer, and then you have the “zero                         versus letter O” problem, the                         “numeral 1 versus letter l versus                         letter   I” problem, and                         then there is the matter of all the guns                         with duplicate serial numbers                         (various Chinese guns, certain                           American guns).                       ” ’“Okay?” Hester says, in a                         pleading sort of way. The number one reason                         gun traces go dry is because the cop got                         the gun description or the serial number                         wrong.                       ’ ”                         I tell him I need to move on. I could never                         work here. I tell him let’s pretend there’s                         a miracle and we definitely know we have a                         Taurus PT 92 and it has a legible serial                         number.                       ” ’                         We may now move on to Step Two.                       ’ ”                         Step Two: Hester calls the manufacturer (if                         it’s a U. S.  gun) or the importer (for                           guns). He wants to know which                         wholesaler the gunmaker sold the weapon to.                         Basically you say, “Hey, who did you sell                         this gun to?”                       ” ’                         Gun importers are licensed by the ATF, and                         they have to keep records of acquisitions                         and sales. So the importer has to go                         through all his gun records and find that                         particular Taurus PT 92 with that                         particular serial number, find what batch                         it was in, and tell you what wholesaler it                         went to.                       ’ ’                         Step Three: You call the wholesaler and                         say, “Who did you sell it to?”                       ’ ”                           The wholesaler, who also has to keep such                           records, goes through the same rigmarole                           the importer or manufacturer did, and he                           gives you the name of the gun store that                           ordered it from him. Let’s say it was                           Walmart.                         ” ’                           Step Four: This could go one of two ways.                         ’ ”                           If the Walmart is still in business, you                           call it. The actual store. Not corporate                           headquarters, or some warehouse, but the                           actual Walmart in Omaha or Miami or                           Wheeling. You call that store and you                           say, “To whom did you sell this Taurus PT                           92 with this particular serial number on                           it?” By law, every gun dealer in America                           has to keep a “bound book” or an “orderly                           arrangement of   pages” (some                           have been known to use toilet paper in                           protest) to record every firearm’s                           manufacturer or importer, model, serial                           number, type, caliber or gauge, date                           received, date of sale.

You have found your gun                           owner. “I get a sense of ‘Yeah, I got                           you, pal,’ ” Hester tells me, about what                           it feels like to find just the right                           4473. It can take people at the tracing                           center 70 phone calls on one trace alone.                           There are rows and rows of cubicles                           filled with ladies on phones doing the                           calling, but not everything happens by                           phone. They do have some Internet in the                           building:   is a system that allows                           cops to submit requests for gun traces                           and get the results back by computer, if                           they’re subscribers. They can also mail                           the requests in. Either way, once you                           have found the name of the gun owner, you                           get back to the cop who initiated the                           trace.                         ” ”                             “And then I say, ‘Okay, your trace is                             done; I got the buyer,’ ” Hester tells                             me. “And they say, ‘Oh, who is it?’ ”                             Maybe it’s one of the suspects. “And                             he’ll say, ‘Are you sure?’ And I’ll                             say, ‘I’ve got this form in my hand                             here.

Maybe you’re working on a                             trace, and it turns out that the                             Walmart that sold the gun was one of                             those old cruddy Walmarts that closed                             down in the 1990s. This leads you back,                             as almost everything does, to Charlie’s                             boxes.                           ” ’                             Now you go dig.                           ’ ”                             All the    records that                             come in here —  2 million last                             month —  are eventually imaged and                             organized according to the store that                             sent them.
