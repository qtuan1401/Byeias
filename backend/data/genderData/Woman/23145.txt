Coast guard  —   nor did it come from the city’s sewer system. “These sulfur odors are not coming from us,” San Francisco Public Utilities Commission spokesman Charles Sheehan told KQED in an email. However, Bay Area news station KRON 4 noted that PGE is looking into the possibility that the smell could have been caused by a series of earthquakes that took place in Lake Tahoe two days ago, which may have caused the ground to shift, releasing a   smell into the atmosphere.
