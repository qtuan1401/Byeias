Rep. Brian Babin ( ) spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday about Wednesday’s final presidential debate in Las Vegas. [In terms of voter fraud, or the election being “rigged,” Babin said, “There are fraud investigations going on right now in three states: Virginia, Indiana, and Colorado. And we know that in Virginia, Gov. McAuliffe tried unsuccessfully to pardon thousands and thousands of convicted felons, and the state Supreme Court shot that down. ”  Babin also discussed recent videos from James O’Keefe, as Breitbart News reported, in terms of perpetuating voter fraud: “The second video in James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas investigation of the 2016 election reveals what O’Keefe describes as Democratic Party operatives tell[ing] us how to successfully commit voter fraud on a massive scale. ” When it came to accepting November’s election results, said Babin, “It’s amazing how quickly liberal Democrats forget. Al Gore refused to concede the race in 2000.   …     They fought it in the Congress. They fought it in the courts. They talked about it for the next eight years. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
