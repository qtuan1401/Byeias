And there are a lot of major changes which are going to have a dramatic impact on the health care marketplace which is now   of the economy. ” She continued, “I don’t know what the leader McConnell has in mind. I don’t know what the 13 white men when you have five Republican women who are excluded from that, that these 13 men are supposed to sit down and put something together. ” She added, “I’m really very worried that in the rush to judgment we create a major health care problems for people and we lose a lot of jobs in so doing and we create a whole atmosphere of unpredictability. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
