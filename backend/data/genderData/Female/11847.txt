A litany of   celebrities braved   temperatures to attend President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama’s final party at the White House on Friday. [The   crowd at the Obama’s farewell bash included George and Amal Clooney, Meryl Streep, Steven Spielberg, Stevie Wonder, David Letterman, George Lucas, Paul McCartney, and many more.
