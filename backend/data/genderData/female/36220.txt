Cleveland (CNN) The Republican Party will declare internet pornography a ”public health crisis” under an amendment added to the draft party platform Monday at preliminary meetings in Cleveland. North Carolina delegate Mary Frances Forrester successfully proposed the amendment in a subcommittee of the platform committee Monday morning.  ”The internet must not become a safe haven for predators,” the provision states. ”Pornography, with its harmful effects, especially on children, has become a public health crisis that is destroying the life of millions. We encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to children’s safety and  . We applaud the social networking sites that bar sex offenders from participation. We urge energetic prosecution of child pornography which closely linked to human trafficking.” The amendment passed with little debate.  The debates over the platform on Monday touched on a variety of topics, from endangered species to medical marijuana to abortion and international trade.  The full committee continues its deliberations on the platform into Tuesday and will send a full draft to the floor of the convention next week.
