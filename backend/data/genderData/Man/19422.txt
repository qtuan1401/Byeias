On January 17 actress Amy Schumer accepted a Critics’ Choice award and closed her acceptance speech by thanking the two victims who were shot and killed during a showing of Trainwreck in Lafayette, Louisiana. [The deceased victims —     Jillian Johnson and    Mayci Breaux —  where killed when John Russell Houser allegedly opened fire on July 23.  At the end of her five minute, twelve second acceptance speech, Schumer said, “And I want to thank Mayci Breaux and Jillian Johnson, who died in Lafayette because a mentally ill person got their hands on a gun. ” Schumer did not mention that Houser bought his gun “legally. ” According to Fox 8, the ATF found that Houser bought his . 40 caliber handgun “in February 2014 at a pawnshop in Phenix City, Alabama. ” This means Obama’s executive expansion of background checks would not have stopped Houser, because Houser acquired his handgun via a background check —  which is the same way Gabby Giffords’ attacker acquired his gun, and it’s the same way Virginia gunman Vester Lee Flanagan acquired his handgun as well.
