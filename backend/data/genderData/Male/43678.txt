’   Chloe Bridgewater, who lives in Hereford, England, has a little   more drive than your average   . ’ ’   Fascinated by her Kindle Fire tablet and robots  —   and totally   taken by the idea of working somewhere with   chairs,     and slides  —   Chloe decided to apply for a job at   . ’ ”   Here’s Chloe’s letter, shared with Business Insider by her   father, Andy Bridgewater: ” ’  ’ ’   Super cute, right? Imagine her surprise and delight when she got   a letter back from the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, who   encouraged her to follow her dreams. ’ ’   ”I look forward to receiving your job application when you are   finished with school! :)” he wrote. ’ ’   Take a look at the letter, shared in a  by Andy earlier this week: ’ ’  ’ ’   Business Insider has confirmed the veracity of the letter. ’ ’   In that LinkedIn post, Andy said the letter was a     confidence booster for Chloe, who was ”knocked down” by a car   years ago. ’ ’  ’ ”   Chloe’s fascination with Google began recently, Andy told   Business Insider, when she asked her father where his ideal place   to work would be. Andy currently works in sales for a     parts manufacturer. ” ’   ”And I said, ’’Oh, Google would be a nice place to work,’’” he   said, because of its   perks and the   work   it does. When Chloe decided she wanted to work there, too, her   father encouraged her to apply and ”get the ball rolling,” he   said. ’ ”   All the attention garnered from Pichai’s response has redoubled   Chloe’s drive to work for Google. Andy says his daughter now   wants to find a way into the Silicon   company through   going on TV and talking to the media. ” ”   He’s largely resisted, though, saying he wants her to focus on   her studies and develop her skills. ” ’   But Andy also wants to brush up on his own technological skills   to catch up with Chloe. ’ ’   ”Sadly, I think I’’ve got to up my game,” he said. ’ ’Chloe Bridgewater, who lives in Hereford. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
