The Evergreen State College faculty is as biased as one might expect, according to recently released data on the staff’s political donation history. [During the 2016 presidential elections, Evergreen faculty reportedly donated an overwhelming $10, 086 to Democratic candidates and only $400 to Republican candidates. Bernie Sanders received the majority of donations from Evergreen faculty, taking in $5, 404 from the college’s faculty compared to Hillary Clinton’s $2, 026.  Evergreen President George Bridges made multiple donations to Democratic candidates, with $250 going to Rep. Dennis Heck in 2016, $300 to former Rep. Walt Minnick in 2008, and $500 to Sen. Patty Murray in 2014. Donation totals for the faculty weren’t much different during the 2008 presidential elections. Evergreen employees contributed over $16, 000 to Democratic candidates and only $200 to Republican candidates. During the 2004 election, 100 percent of faculty donations went to Democratic candidates. Perhaps most interestingly, Evergreen faculty have not donated a single dollar to a Republican congressional candidate since 2012.
