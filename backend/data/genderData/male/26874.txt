Twitter reportedly shut down Sunday night, shortly after WikiLeaks announced a DDOS attack on their own servers. [According to Downdetector. com, as many as 14, 000 people experienced issues connecting to Twitter for nearly three hours. The outages seemed to predominantly affect users across the USA and Japan, however Twitter has not stated what caused the crash. The social media website went down shortly after WikiLeaks posted to their Facebook page saying that they were receiving a DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service) on their servers, causing some of them to crash.   Twitter users were able to access their accounts a few hours later, with many questioning if there was a link between the Twitter outage and the WikiLeaks server attack, noting that the websites went down shortly following WikiLeaks‚Äô second release of Democrat National Committee emails.
