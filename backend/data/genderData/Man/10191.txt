The U. S. Army has been testing a   laser weapon that can destroy drones. [Researchers are testing Stryker infantry transport vehicles mounted with a 5kW laser weapon so that one day, the weapon can destroy drones on the front lines, the Daily Mail reported.  The laser weapon brought down 50 drones during a   firing exercise. “They love the system and they are excited about not only what they can do with it in the air, but what they can do with it on the ground as well,” Lt. Col. Jeff Erts, who is in charge of the experiments, said. The Army is also working with Lockheed Martin to test a 60kW laser weapon. Other branches of the military also plan to utilize laser weapons. The U. S. Navy is planning on deploying laser weapons on its ships within the next two years.
