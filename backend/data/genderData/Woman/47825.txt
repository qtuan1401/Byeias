’  ’ ’   Even steakhouses are getting hurt by the oil crash. ’ ’   Texas holds some of the richest shale plays in the US, and it has   been one of the places most affected by the downturn in     prices. ’ ’   The    consistently includes commentary from business owners whose   operations are linked to the oil industry. ’ ”   And on Thursday we got another anecdote from the management of   Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, a   operator of   steakhouses across America. ” ’   The company noted during its earnings call that sales at   individual restaurants with exposure to the energy sector   declined. ’ ’’ ’   After an analyst asked about   markets, here was the   response from Thomas Pennison Jr. chief financial officer   (transcript via Bloomberg, emphasis ours): ’ ”   Del Frisco’s is obviously not an oil company. But if workers   continue losing their jobs and consumer sentiment remains sour,   it could continue to hurt its restaurants. ” ’   But oil prices, which have rallied more than 20% this year, may   now be turning the tide. ’ ’ said: ”We’’re   starting to hear from our general managers who talk to their   guests in the industry that they’’re starting to feel better, and   once they have cleared a hurdle, and that hurdle always is that   they see daylight, that’’s when they start spending more in   entertainment.” ’
