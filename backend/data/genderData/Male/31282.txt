Former NFL quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow signed a   baseball contract with the New York Mets. [The Mets announced on Thursday that the    college football icon will play in the instructional league. Tebow showcased his skills for 28 MLB teams in Los Angeles in late August before the Mets agreed to sign him.  Considered to be a long shot to ever tie his cleats for an MLB team, the former Denver Bronco reinforced that notion during his showcase where he struggled against live pitching. On top of that, Tebow actually fell down on the warning track while fielding a ball.  On a positive note, according to the New York Daily News, Tebow demonstrated excellent power. He earned praise from one scout who observed, “The body is just outstanding  …     He’s athletic, has speed, power. ” Those attributes motivated both the Braves and the Rockies to also demonstrate an interest in acquiring the University of Florida legend.  Kevin Fagan, Tebow’s baseball coach at Allen D. Nease High School in Ponte Vedra Fl. wouldn’t be surprised if Tebow makes it all the way to the bigs. One time a Colorado Rockies scout came to watch Nease’s star shortstop, Fagan recalled, but got the “Tebow Experience” instead. “Tebow hits one from Nease’s home plate to beyond second base on the far softball field (about 400 feet),” Fagan says. “And [the scout] says to me, ‘Who is that guy?’ ” Tebow last played baseball during his junior year in high school in 2005, when he won   honors, hit four homers and batted . 494. Besides winning the Heisman Trophy, Tebow went on to win two national championships. He played for the Broncos and Jets from 2010 through 2012 and had short stints with the Eagles and Patriots but never saw any regular season playing time.
