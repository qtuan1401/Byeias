.@TuckerCarlson: Pres. Obama has clearly taken a side, and it’s not the side of law enforcementhttps:  .  Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” network regular and Daily Caller editor Tucker Carlson pointed out that President Barack Obama isn’t taking the side of the police, but instead the detractors of law enforcement who are accusing police of racism.  “They’re taking a really clear stand for this group against the police,” Carlson said. “Not just a specific police department or a specific cop, but all police  —   accusing all police of racism. Now I’m not blaming the president or any of those people for this shooting. But clearly, they’ve taken a side and it’s not the side of law enforcement. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
