 (CNN) Kathy Griffin    and her snarky humor    are saying   to ”Fashion Police” after seven episodes. The comedian announced her departure from E! channel’s fashion commentary show in a statement posted on her Twitter account.  In her message Thursday, she said her style did not  blend in with the show, which she appeared to criticize.  ”There is plenty to make fun of in pop culture without bringing people’s bodies into it,” she posted. ”I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference.”  Griffin replaced Joan Rivers, who died last year after surgery.  Her departure comes after   Giuliana Rancic faced backlash last month for suggesting that Disney star Zendaya Coleman’s dreadlocks smelled of marijuana.  Social media jumped to Coleman’s defense after she described the remarks as ”incredibly offensive.” Rancic later issued an   apology to the   .   Shortly after the controversy,   Kelly Osbourne announced that she was leaving the show.  E! confirmed Griffin’s exit, saying she was not the right fit.  ”We wish her all the best and are grateful for her time on the show, as well as the many laughs that she gave us all,” it said. The show returns March 30 with Rancic and   Brad Goreski.
