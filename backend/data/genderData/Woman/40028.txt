 (CNN) An    boy was attacked and killed by two family dogs in central Florida.  Declin Moss was playing on the porch of his home Monday morning when the dogs attacked for ”unknown reasons,” the Hernando County Sherriff’s Office said. The boy lived in a home with his grandfather, Gregory Moss, and mother. His grandfather was home at the time.  By the time deputies arrived, the child was dead.  Neighbor Charles Shorey told CNN affiliate WFLA that Declin was ”a beautiful kid.”  ”I feel sorry for the mother. She’s, she’s fighting and struggling,” Shorey said.  Authorities are investigating and have spoken to the child’s mother.  They describe the two dogs, Thumper and Max, as mixed breed. They are awaiting a vet’s confirmation on the breed types, and haven’t yet said whether the dogs will be euthanized. There were two other dogs in the home that were not involved.  ”It is a terrible, terrible event today. Obviously, even those of us who work with death and dying and serious injury, the firefighters on scene were heartbroken,” Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis told WFLA.
