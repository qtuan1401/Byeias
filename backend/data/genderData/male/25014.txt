A    Turkish man broadcasted his suicide on Facebook Live, after claiming that his girlfriend had broken up with him. [Erdogan Ceren pulled the trigger of his shotgun twice, which was pointed at his chest, with the second shot taking his life after a failed first attempt.  “No one believed when I said I will kill myself  —   so watch this,” said Ceren in the suicide broadcast, which has since accumulated over 633, 000 views, 15, 000 reactions, and 16, 000 comments. Ceren’s relatives reportedly heard the gunshot and discovered his body, but he was eventually pronounced dead in hospital after several Facebook users pleaded with him to reconsider the act. Ceren had posted numerous somber Facebook posts leading up to the suicide, including one which read, “Our love saga would be written, ‘Behold, the eyes would not cry, half of you is going to tell you now, my hands do without that side. ’” “And now he passed away in peace. Why do you think spring is in the middle of ice,” he wrote in another post. “Just shut up and smiled at him, I gave a lesson ‘That’s why darkness. Forgive me, girl. ’” The live broadcast remains on Ceren’s official Facebook page (WARNING: GRAPHIC) with the social network yet to comment on the situation.
