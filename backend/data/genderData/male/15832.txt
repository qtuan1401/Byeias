The NAACP is suing in federal court to stop several county boards of election in North Carolina from removing people from voter rolls through challenges filed by individuals. [The lawsuit filed Monday is against the State Board of Elections and county boards in Moore and Beaufort counties, where thousands of votersâ€™ names have been challenged, the Associated Press reports.  According to the National Voter Registration Act, boards of election are barred from clearing voter names from the voter rolls within 90 days of a federal election. However, state law does not have those restraints on individual challenges. The federal law has not been interpreted to ban individual challenges, according to the director of the State Board of Elections. The lawsuit is also looking to restore the names of voters previously struck from the rolls.
