These are what you get as a result of his type of speech and rhetoric. ” According to Ward, the protesters at the event didn’t feel that they were shutting down free speech. “This is not a point of shutting down free speech, it’s the point of shutting down hate speech” and promised to “continue to do so long as there’s anything that’s happening that threatens my safety.’ Ward, who is political science graduate, also accused Yiannopoulos of peddling racist rhetoric: “You have a bunch of white people who wanna actually say a bunch of racist s*** and that’s not okay. ” Tom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
