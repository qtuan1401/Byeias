The   claims to have held the first such survey on the topic since the lawmaker’s slaying. Most of Qriously’s surveys are done for corporate brands and it has not been previously conducted an EU referendum poll. Respondents were asked: “Imagine the EU referendum were held today. Would you vote for the U. K. to remain a member of the European Union, or leave the European Union?” They were given three options: “Remain in the EU,” “Leave the EU,” or “Don’t know. ” Qriously found that 52% will vote to leave the bloc in a national referendum on June 23.
