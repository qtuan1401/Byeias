On Wednesday’s broadcast of “MSNBC Live,” Jeff Weaver, the Campaign Manager for Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) argued that DNC Chair Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) “almost from the   that she has been working against Bernie Sanders. ”  Weaver said, “The Chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, I mean, it’s been pretty clear, Steve, from almost from the   that she has been working against Bernie Sanders. I mean, there’s no doubt about it, for personal reasons, whether it’s that debate schedule that we had, that very confined defined debate schedule that we had with debates scheduled on weekends, where no one was going to be watching, whether it was this joint fundraising agreement that’s  —   they have with the Hillary Clinton campaign, which is taking money out of state parties, whether it’s this  —   these standing committees, where they have appointed really hostile Hillary Clinton partisans against  —   to head these committees at the convention. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has really been a divider, and not really provided the kind of leadership that the Democratic Party needs. ” He added, “[I]f you think back to that issue where they shut off senator sanders’ access to his data shortly before the Iowa caucuses, I mean, that was a unilateral action taken on her part. ” Weaver further stated, “[I]t’s been clear there’s a pattern of conduct, from the beginning of this campaign, that has been hostile to Bernie Sanders and his supporters, and really, she’s really become a divisive figure in the party. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
