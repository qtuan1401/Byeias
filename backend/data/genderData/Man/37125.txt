 (CNN) Inbee Park has seven major titles to her name, a career grand slam and is a former world No 1.  Now the South Korean can add the title of first Olympic champion in women’s golf since 1900 to her CV after holding off the challenge of world No. 1 Lydia Ko and China’s Feng Shanshan at Rio 2016. Park recorded a    66 Saturday to finish on    268 for the week and a convincing five shots clear of New Zealand’s Ko in the silver medal position. Day 15    Follow all of Saturday’s action, ”I feel extremely honored and proud that I get to win a gold medal in the Olympic Games,” world No. 5 Park said.  ”It feels truly unreal. I am just so happy to be standing on the highest spot on the podium. I have won many tournaments but I have never felt this before.” Park qualified for the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame this year, but has struggled with form and injury in recent months and missed July’s British Open.
