Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson announced Sunday that rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) had apologized to him on Saturday evening for his campaign’s behavior in Iowa, and also asked to meet with him privately. [According to the Washington Post, Cruz approached Carson during a commercial break at Saturday’s Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire and requested a private meeting.  “He said he’s sorry that this happened and he wants to sit down and talk,” Carson said in an interview with The Washington Post. “He wants to discuss the whole thing and clear the air. ” The retired neurosurgeon said he mostly listened when his Republican rival approached him on stage but did agree to hear Cruz out in the coming days. They did not set a date. “To be determined,” Carson said when asked where they may meet. “Doesn’t matter. ” The Carson campaign has been critical of Cruz after his campaign spread false rumors during the Iowa caucus, and sent voicemails  to Iowa precinct captains suggestings that Carson was dropping out of the race.
