It was like a moment from a Disney movie. Mike Karas, a tourist from Honolulu, had his camera pointed toward an exquisite view of Yosemite when a bride and her groom stepped onto a rocky ledge high above a valley. She turned to him as the sun burst into an apricot hue on the horizon. “It was like wow, that’s amazing,” Mr. Karas, 31, said. He snapped a photo. But the mystery couple vanished down a trail before he could flag them down. Later, he posted the image to Instagram, where it spread like crazy and inspired reports as far away as New Zealand. It also fueled an effort to identify the couple that stretched for days. Then, late Tuesday, the mystery was solved. The bride was Catherine Mack, an Australian actress, and her groom Rick Donald, also an actor. Mr. Karas said he spoke to Ms. Mack by phone after she spotted the photo on social media and connected with him. “She was laughing and happy about the photo and the whole story and loved it,” he said. “She didn’t know how big exactly the story had become. ” Ms. Mack said in an email that the couple were married in the national park right before the photo was taken.
