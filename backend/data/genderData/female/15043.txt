The College Fix reports an administrator from the college released a memo instructing students to get rid of the bats immediately. Dear RAD Students, We are aware of a small group of students coordinating a community patrol of housing and campus. We acknowledge and understand the fear and concerns that are motivating these actions. We also understand that these students are seeking to provide an alternative source of safety from external entities as well as those community members who they distrust. Community patrols can be a useful tool for helping people to feel safe, however the use of bats or similar instruments is not productive. Some members of this group have been observed carrying batons   bats. Carrying bats is causing many to feel unsafe and intimidated. The bats must be put away immediately in order to protect all involved.   participating in this activity are advised to leave campus. Another video allegedly shows a student roaming the campus with a baseball bat. (1:40 mark).  Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
