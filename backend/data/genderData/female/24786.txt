GOP presidential candidate Dr Ben Carson is skipping the next debate after failing to win a single state or collect many delegates through Super Tuesday. [“I have decided not to attend the Fox News GOP Presidential Debate tomorrow night in Detroit,” Carson began in his campaign press release.  Even though I will not be in my hometown of Detroit on Thursday, I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America.  I do not see a political path forward in light of last evening’s Super Tuesday primary results. However, this grassroots movement on behalf of “We the People” will continue. Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President, I remain committed to Saving America for Future Generations. We must not depart from our goals to restore what God and our Founders intended for this exceptional nation. “I appreciate the support, financial and otherwise, from all corners of America. Gratefully, my campaign decisions are not constrained by finances rather by what is in the best interests of the American people. ” Carson said he will discuss his conservative grassroots support and movement more at CPAC later this week.
