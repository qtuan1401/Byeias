Provocative Los   street artist Sabo has set his sights on Leonardo DiCaprio and Hillary Clinton, satirizing their respective charitable foundations and turning them into   enterprises in a series of new posters that have been put up in Los Angeles. [The   Revenant actor and founder of the   Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation was set to host the Democratic presidential candidate at his Los Angeles home for a   lunch fundraiser on Tuesday, but said a scheduling conflict had prevented him from hosting the event. Pop star Justin Timberlake and his wife, actress Jessica Biel, will host the event instead.  Last week, reports surfaced that DiCaprio’s foundation is alleged to have received donations from funds tied to a $3 billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme. Meanwhile, Clinton has been dogged by a steady stream of revelations that she allegedly used her position as Secretary of State to grant preferential treatment and special access to major Clinton Foundation donors. Sabo  —   who has a history of lambasting liberal politicians and Hollywood actors with his art  —   let loose with his latest piece, which sees the heads of both DiCaprio and Clinton spinning around in stacked clothes dryers with $100 bills swirling all around them. One of the washing machines reads: “The Clinton Crime Family: Laundering Money Since 1997. ” “Bernie sold out for a lake house! !!” reads another, referencing Clinton’s presidential primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sabo wanted to place the his   artwork near the actor’s home, but was thwarted by security. While working anonymously to roast Hollywood liberals, Sabo’s art has seemingly been seen everywhere as of late. Last week, he altered Fox Searchlight’s upcoming slave epic Birth of a Nation film posters to read “Rapist?” after the film’s star Nate Parker’s 1990s sexual assault case resurfaced.
