Peyton Manning’s retirement press conference on Monday was a tour de force, a virtuoso performance. But a couple of moments surely made the liberal sports media squeamish. [The former Denver Broncos quarterback, a conservative, brought up hunting and the Bible. Over the last month, Manning has been pondering whether to retire, or keep playing.  “I really wanted to take some time to enjoy [the Super Bowl] win on family vacation, went hunting with old teammate Jeff Saturday and really just had some great time to reflect,” Manning said. We are awaiting a statement from PETA. And he also quoted the Bible, something else that generally makes secular progressives uneasy. “There’s a scripture reading, 2 Timothy 4:7: ‘I have fought the good fight and I have finished the race. I have kept the faith,’” Manning said. “Well, I’ve fought a good fight. I’ve finished my football race, and after 18 years it’s time. God bless all of you and God bless football. ” Don’t expect to see these two quotes in many newspaper sports sections.
