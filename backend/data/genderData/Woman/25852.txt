Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos discussed gay culture and Caitlyn Jenner with Canadian writer and cultural critic Alex Kazemi on this weeks episode of The Milo Yiannopoulos Show. [“I get the impression that gay culture is basically dead now, there’s no transgression left” said Milo.  Guest Alex Kazemi replied “Transgressive gay men of the past, they weren’t asking for anyone to understand them. They were saying ‘We know we’re going against the bible, we know that we have an evil that some satanists and goths would die for, we know that our whole lifestyle is a risk to ourselves and the whole planet and its apocalyptic and its Armageddon.’ “ Kazemi continued, commenting on transgender celebrity Caitlyn Jenner: “Like Caitlyn Jenner, I’m sure she was so much happier when Caitlyn was the demon that came out at 1AM when Kylie and Kendall were asleep!” “This is what I always say about my sex life, I’m just not turned on by stuff that isn’t forbidden, I’m not turned on unless I’m not allowed to do it and once you remove those moral pillars from society, all of the fun and transgression disappears!” replied Milo. “Men and Male sexuality, the male psyche, is dark and dangerous at times. Its powerful, that’s what women like about it, that’s what some men like about it. ” Listen to the clip below, or watch the full episode here.
