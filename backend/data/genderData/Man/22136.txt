Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” while commenting on the overnight shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, FL in which approximately 50 people were killed, over 40 were injured and that authorities are investigating as an act of terrorism, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) took aim at automatic weapons.  Sanders said, “It’s horrific. It’s unthinkable. Our hopes go out to all those who were shot that they can recover. I gotta tell you  over 25 years ago, I believed that in this country we should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people. We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them, criminals, people who are mentally ill. So that struggle continues. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
