’  ’ ”   The fitness world is experiencing huge shifts, and it’s making it   an incredibly profitable business. ” ’   From SoulCycle to CrossFit boxes to the popularity of Tough   Mudders, people are spending more money on fitness. SoulCycle   even  last   summer. ’ ’   All of this comes at a time when people are . ’ ’   The only brands that are thriving, unsurprisingly, are activewear   brands like Nike, Under Armour, and . ’ ’   Oddly, fitness can be a pretty pricey endeavor   so why are   people forking over money to fancy classes? ’ ’   It might be because it falls under the category that we know   : experiences. ’ ’   ”O ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”What seems consistent is building    and I say this word with   some trepidation   kind of these authentic,     brands seems to be the big lesson here,” he said.
