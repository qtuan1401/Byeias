Country music legend Dolly Parton came out in support of those fighting to repeal North Carolina’s new transgender bathroom law in a video posted by CNN Money. [“I think everybody should be treated with respect,” Parton says in the short video clip, posted to Facebook. “I don’t judge people. I try not to get too caught up in all the controversy of things. ”  “I hope that everybody gets a chance to be who and what they are,” Parton added.  The    singer has long been an advocate for the LGBT community. In 2005, Parton was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Travelin’ Thru. The hit single was featured in the   film Transamerica.  While most of Parton’s video message was serious in tone, she concluded her statement by adding a little levity. “I just know if I have to pee I’m gonna pee,” she said, adding, “I don’t care where it’s gonna be. ” North Carolina’s HB 2  —   known alternatively as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, or the   “transgender bathroom law”  —   requires transgender individuals to use public restrooms that correspond with their biological sex. The law also forbids local municipal governments from passing ordinances that allow individual who chose their own “gender identity” to use the public bathroom of their choosing. On June 3rd, Parton launched her   nationwide Pure  Simple Tour with a performance in Greensboro, North Carolina. Myriad musicians and entertainers, including Bruce Springsteen, Sir Elton John, Jimmy Buffet, Dave Mathews Band, and Michael Moore have either boycotted North Carolina or donated proceeds from their concert to LBGT nonprofits, to protest the state’s new bathroom law. Parton’s June 3 concert in North Carolina was her first show in the state in 25 years.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
