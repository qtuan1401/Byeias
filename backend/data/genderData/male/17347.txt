John Fund writes at Foxnews. com about the national security risks involved in Hillary Clinton’s email scandal, including “the danger that Hillary Clinton could be the target of international blackmail” if elected. [From Fund’s  :  “This is just a distraction,” Democratic pollster Mark Mellman says of the news the FBI is reexamining the Clinton email case. During a press conference  —   which lasted all of three minutes  —   Hillary Clinton herself said, “I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails. I think that’s factored into that people think and now they’re choosing a president. ” But for people in the intelligence community  —   including disgruntled FBI agents and even former officials in the Pentagon, it’s not that easy. The revival of the Clinton email scandal reminds them of just how exposed Clinton left highly classified information. Last September, an FBI report noted the bureau couldn’t find proof her private email server was hacked into by adversaries. But it noted that the private server had to be shut down repeatedly because of hacker attacks and a successful attack wasn’t likely to have left fingerprints.  Also, some “hostile foreign actors” were able to break into the personal email accounts of Clinton’s close aides, obtaining a treasure trove of emails exchanged with her personal account. Note that so far none of the WikiLeaks revelations have come from Hillary’s personal account. That could mean it wasn’t hacked, or it could mean that “hostile” actors are waiting to make use of them. Given the growing suspicions that the Clinton Foundation may have exchanged favors with the Clinton State Department, her private server could be of great interest in establishing such links. In short, we have to acknowledge the danger that Hillary Clinton could be the target of international blackmail in the White House. Read the rest here.
