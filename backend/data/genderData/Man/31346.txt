Monday on CNN’s “Wolf,” while discussing the latest reports of the State Department pressuring the FBI to mark some of then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emails as unclassified, The Atlantic’s Molly Ball said, “So many of these leaks and these revelations play right into this distrust voters have for Hillary Clinton. ”  Ball said, “Well the Clinton campaign of course says nothing to see here. They point out the alleged quid pro quo in the emails, not to get too far into the weeds, never occurred. What was proposed to have the classification change didn’t actually happen. But I think beyond that there’s a lot of stuff in these transcripts and in the FBI documents that we can expect Secretary Clinton to be asked about in the third presidential debate on Wednesday —  and has had a hard time answering a lot of these questions previously. I think it’s part of what’s keeping the race close is that so many of these leaks and these revelations play right into this distrust voters have for Hillary Clinton. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
