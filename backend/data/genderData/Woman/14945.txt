A Nike logo brandished in MILO’s border wall construction video has led to a hasty disavowal by the company itself, after a Daily Beast reporter approached them for comment.[  The video, in which MILO sports a new red Nike tracksuit, prompted Daily Beast reporter Olivia Nuzzi to ask for comment from them. I asked Nike how they feel about Milo promoting that he’s wearing their clothes in this video. ”We’re not in support, no,” a spokesman said.  —   Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) January 29, 2017,  According to Nuzzi, Nike immediately distanced themselves, saying that they did not support MILO’s   video. The Nike spokesman told me Milo was not provided with any of the clothes from the company and they have no affiliation with him.  —   Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) January 29, 2017,  It seems MILO’s brand is too much for Nike to handle so much so they have to disavow him. Banned by Twitter, too dangerous for Nike. MILO https:  .   —   Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) January 30, 2017,
