After fulfilling his promise and bringing Cleveland its first major sports title in 52 years, LeBron James is reportedly on track to becoming the NBA’s first $200 million player.  James opted out of his contract on Tuesday and is likely to sign a   deal with the Cavs for $27. 5 million, which he has the option to do. According to ESPN, when the NBA’s salary cap dramatically increases after next season, the Cavs will be in a position to “offer James a   deal that currently is projected to be worth between $  million depending on various models NBA teams are using for revenue growth. ” That projected deal would make James “the   player in league history for the   season by earning $35 million, passing Michael Jordan’s record of $33 million in  ” and he would become the league’s first player to make $40 million a year in the   season.
