The Daily Beast’s Eleanor Clift argued that young people should sign up for insurance under Obamacare in part because, “People need to carry their load in a shared pool of coverage” on Friday’s “McLaughlin Group. ”  Clift said of the people who have failed to purchase insurance under Obamacare, “Some of them are young people who think that they can avoid any kind of accident. But one of them gets, you know, hit by a bus, or motorcycle and ends up in the emergency room, do we really want to be paying for that? People need to carry their load in a shared pool of coverage. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
