Following Sunday night’s presidential debate, questioner Ken Bone has become an internet sensation. [Bone asked a question to the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates last night, saying, “What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?”  Ken’s unique look of thick rimmed glasses, a bright red sweater, thin mustache, and a disposable camera that he used to photograph the event led to him becoming an overnight internet meme sensation. #KenBone began trending on Twitter with approximately 94, 000 tweets, Twitter parody accounts popped up of him, and his name became one of the most talked about topics on Facebook.
