In New Hampshire on Friday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton concluded a rally by awkwardly swaying with a group of fellow female political leaders to the tune of “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten.[  Hillary was joined by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Sen Debbie Stabenow, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, as well as New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan. During the rally, Stabenow explained why it was time to elect a woman president and mocked Bernie Sanders’ call for a political revolution. “When folks talk about a revolution, the revolution is electing the first woman president of the United States!” she said. “That’s the revolution. And we’re ready for the revolution. ” During the rally, Clinton recalled the time she won the state after Obama beat her in 2008. “I know from my last experience here, when I came in 16 points down or something like that  —   but who’s counting?” she said. “I wasn’t running against a neighbor but an incredibly charismatic candidate, as we all remember. The only reason I was able to pull that off was because of you. ”
