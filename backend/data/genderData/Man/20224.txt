PARIS (Reuters)  —   France’s highest administrative court on Friday suspended a ban on   burkini swimsuits that has outraged Muslims and opened divisions within the government, pending a definitive ruling. [The Conseil d’Etat gave the ruling following a request from the League of Human Rights to overturn the burkini ban in the Mediterranean town of   on the grounds it contravenes civil liberties.  The court said in a statement the decree to ban burkinis in   “seriously, and clearly illegally, breached the fundamental freedoms to come and go, the freedom of beliefs and individual freedom. ” Under the French legal system, temporary decisions can be handed down before the court takes more time to prepare a judgement on the underlying legality of the case.  The ban, which spread to more than a dozen coastal towns, had exposed cracks within the Socialist government’s unity as Prime Minister Manuel Valls defended it on Thursday while some ministers criticised it. The issue has shone a light on secular France’s difficulties responding to homegrown jihadists and foreign militants following Islamist attacks in Nice and a Normandy church in July. It has also made French cultural identity a   issue along with security in political debates as the country switches into campaign mode ahead of a presidential election next April.
