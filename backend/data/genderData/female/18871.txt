Actor Mark Wahlberg is promoting an online video in which he says he will be praying for vocations to the priesthood and supporting the work of Catholic diocesan vocation directors. [“I want you to know my support for your work to foster vocations to the priesthood, because I want my children and future generations to have good priests in their lives, just like I had,” Wahlberg says in the video, posted on Facebook by the vocations office of the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island.  “My Catholic faith is the anchor that supports everything I do in life,” the actor continues. “In my daily prayers, I ask for guidance, strength in my vocation as a husband and as a father. ” As the Boston Pilot reports, Wahlberg, who starred in The Perfect Storm, Planet of the Apes, The Departed, and The Fighter, recorded the video to serve as a greeting for the National Conference of Diocesan Vocation Directors. The actor also served as emcee for Pope Francis’ visit to Philadelphia last year during the World Meeting of Families event. Wahlberg, who lives in Boston, says in the video that he has experienced “many wonderful priests” in his life. “Growing up in Dorchester, I got myself into trouble now and then but I always had a priest to stick by me,” he says, adding: I was married by a priest. My children were baptized by a priest. And whenever somebody in my family passed away, they’ve all been buried by a priest. My sins have been forgiven when I go to confession to a priest. Every time I go to Mass, it’s through a priest’s hands that I receive the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, which strengthens me to share my Catholic faith with others. “We the Catholic faithful are counting on you to bring us good and holy priests,” Wahlberg says. “Enjoy my hometown this week, and know that I will pray for you and for your success. Thank you for all that you do, and God bless. ”
