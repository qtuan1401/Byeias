Monday at a rally for his brother, Republican presidential hopeful former Gov. Jeb Bush ( ) in Charleston, SC, former President George W. Bush said his younger brother was a “man of humble, deep and genuine faith,” to which he said was revealed through works, not words.  Former President George W. Bush said, “I think you ought to look for somebody who can handle intense pressure, and won’t wither during crises. I believe that strength can come from faith. It can come from the comfort of a higher power. And the humility that comes in realizing the Almighty’s gift of grace. Jeb’s humility is important for politicians to remember, when they talk about their faith. One of my favorite Bible verses for those in the political arena is from the book of Matthew, to paraphrase, how can you say let me get that speck out of your eye when I’ve got a log in my own? Jeb’s a man of humble, deep and genuine faith. Faith that reveals itself through good works, not loud words. I think you should look for someone whose humility helps him understand what he doesn’t know, and surrounds himself with people who do know what he doesn’t know. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
