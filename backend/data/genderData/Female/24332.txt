Chicago has passed another grim milestone of violence with over 100 people shot in a single   period. [Between Friday, August 5, and the following Friday, over 100 people were shot, with 99 of those occurring from Friday to the next Thursday. This brings the number of shootings to an incredible 800 more than this time last year, according to the Chicago Tribune.  The dangerous week included one of the most deadly days seen in Chicago in over a decade when Monday, August 8, groaned under the weight of 19 shootings and nine killed. One of the victims was a    boy shot outside his home in the Lawndale neighborhood. The child, Tavon Tanner, was sitting outside on the stoop of his home with his family when someone nearby opened fire. The family scrambled into the home, but the child was shot. He is in good condition in a local hospital. The deadly toll on Monday included an amazing nine dead in less than 24 hours. Due to the large number of deaths, Monday was Chicagoâ€™s deadliest day in 13 years. On Thursday, another man was sitting inside his home when several stray bullets came ripping through his window, striking him in the neck and head. The    man died from his wounds. The wildly bloody week brings the number of shootings in the Windy City to 2, 584 shot and 396 shot and killed. According to one estimate, a person in Chicago is shot every 2 hours, and one is shot and killed every 12 hours. And all of this is ahead of what promises to be a steamy hot weekend likely to see up to 40 more shootings and perhaps as many as 10 more deaths.
