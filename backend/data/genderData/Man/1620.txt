Although my dad was one of the friendliest people I’ve ever known, his life seemed to be fully focused on his family and his businesses. My father had two companies: Music Makers Productions, where he promoted the likes of Prince and Bobby Womack, and Hockett Construction and Demolition Company, where he made the bulk of his living for his wife and five kids. We all worked for my father. Mr. Red, one of my father’s best and only friends, was his foreman. He didn’t drive, so we’d all load into the van and head to Bemis, Tenn. to pick him up. Then we’d gather a few more workers and drive to the job site with our hammers and helmets, ready for a long day of labor beneath the steamy, Southern sun. Mr. Red kept us on our feet. As kids, my brothers would drive forklifts and operate bulldozers and backhoes. I can remember pulling bricks from the walls of the buildings we demolished. We’d roll them out in a wheelbarrow to be cleaned, knocking away the mortar with a hatchet. Then, after loading them onto the back of my father’s     we’d head to Memphis to sell them to the brickyards. My father salvaged everything from the demolition jobs:   tubs, scrap metal, lumber, sinks. He even found a baby grand piano once. As we made our way back home to Jackson, Tenn. in the dark of night, I’d always pray for him. My parents were not silent about the obstacles they faced as black   owners in the South. They shared their journey with us to make us stronger and to inspire us to live our dreams regardless of the challenges. They made us work for the things we wanted. But my father worked so hard that it broke my heart. I was worried that his body would not be able to take the            labor much longer. Three years ago, my fears came true. He suffered a major heart attack and learned he had heart disease. The doctors commanded him to stop working, and he was put on a left ventricular assist device to keep his heart beating. A year later, he had a stroke that greatly affected his brain. Our hopes of a heart transplant went out the window. He had around three years to live. I was determined to make them the best. I’d been living in New York for years, but I returned home every month or two just to take him out for an ice cream cone or a drive. He loved to be on the open roads of Tennessee. The stroke left him with early signs of dementia, so we often had a hard time telling if he knew what was going on. On the road one day, he directed me to a trailer in Obion County, Tenn. He told me to knock on the door to see if his friend Bubba was there. As dogs were wildly barking, a man came to the door and said that Bubba had been dead for 10 years. I told my father the news, and we drove to Union City, Tenn, his birthplace. Once again, he directed me to a house and asked me to see if Frank was there. He was dead, too. Both Bubba and Frank had been his workers. When we got home, I pulled into the driveway and turned off the car. My father sat there for a while and then said, “I guess all my friends have died and gone. ” It was as if he was trying to decide whether to stay or to go. On Nov. 14, my father passed away. He was 63. Luckily, we were all able to fly home to be with him that day in the hospital. I come from a singing family. We held hands in a circle around him and sang songs from our childhood. We sang songs we used to sing at church and songs we used to sing to get through the hard work days. I was holding my father’s hand when I felt his spirit leave his body. Looking back, I see that my father’s companies were his form of art, and I find myself still learning lessons from the years we worked side by side. Music promotion was his passion, but construction was his source of financial stability. So many times on the path toward manifesting my own musical dream, I have leaned on the work foundation he and my mother laid for us. The things we are passionate about are fueled by mundane tasks. All is necessary. My father’s goals fed each other. Without construction, there would have been no music promotion. Without his music promotion, I never would have followed a musical path myself. His dream became my own. Always supportive of me, he sang on my song “Shake Down,” one of the greatest gifts he left me. As a vocalist, I treasure the sound of his voice. And I am in awe of his limited time on earth.
