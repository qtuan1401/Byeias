Friday at the Republican presidential Faith  Family Forum in South Carolina, addressing the recent presidential primary issue of women becoming part of a military draft, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said due to modern warfare a draft will never be necessary again.  Rubio said, “I think there was a question in the last debate, they asked about select service. First of all, I don’t even think we need selective service anymore. I don’t think we will ever have a draft again. Modern warfare  —   if it ever reaches that level, because of the weapons that exist I dont think you are ever going to see a draft instituted. Second of all, I do not support drafting woman and forcing them to be combat solders. I don’t support that. I never have and I don’t now. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
