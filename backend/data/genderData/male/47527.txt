’  ’ ’   A  said   Apple was in early talks to acquire Tidal, the     service owned by rapper Jay Z and a collection of his friends. ’ ”   On the face of it, that seems like a rather strange deal. Apple   already has its own   service, Apple Music. And   Tidal isn’t exactly a runaway success. Many of its subscribers   come through deals with telecoms companies. ” ”   But there’s one big reason Tidal could be an attractive prospect   for Apple: the sheer number of artists who are on board with the   platform and giving it exclusives. ” ”   Here’s a photo from Tidal’s relaunch event in New York in March   2015. ” ’  ’ ”   Standing onstage are some of the biggest names in music, and   that’s not even the full lineup of musicians who backed the   company at launch. Many of them have published exclusive music to   the service, too, which is a big draw for consumers. ” ”   Of course, Apple has bought a   service before.    best known for its line of headphones, in   2014. But that deal also included the company’s     platform as well as key figures inside the company like dealmaker   Jimmy Iovine, Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, and rapper   Dr. Dre. ” ’   If you want to know why Apple might acquire Tidal, then look at   the reasons it acquired Beats. Yes, there was the     component, but far more valuable was the   expertise   and contacts that came with hiring someone like Iovine. ’ ” that Iovine was the driving force   behind Apple’s   service. He’s the      dealmaker who has been helping bring in   exclusives. And which other   service is going all   in on exclusives? Tidal. ” ”   Acquiring Jay Z’s startup may not directly bring in a huge uptick   in subscribers for Apple Music, but it would at least help Apple   secure more exclusives and build relations with more people in   the music industry. ”
