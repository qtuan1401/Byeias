Apparently, having the worst quarterback performance in NFL history is not enough to get Colin Kaepernick benched. [On Sunday, the 49ers   quarterback did what few scarcely believed possible. In a game against the Chicago Bears, Kaepernick became the first quarterback in league history to get sacked five times while passing for fewer than five yards. 49ers coach Chip Kelly benched Kaepernick in favor of Blaine Gabbert in the fourth quarter.  One would think, that after turning in a bad performance of that magnitude that Kaepernick would remain benched, and the 9ers would opt to go forward with Gabbert. Well, that’s not going to happen. According to USA Today Sports, “offensive coordinator Curtis Modkins announced Tuesday that Kaepernick would remain the team’s starter for Sunday’s game against the New York Jets. ” As the Sporting News puts it, “It won’t exactly be a stellar quarterback matchup with Kaepernick facing off against   Jets quarterback Bryce Petty, who will be making his second start. The 49ers haven’t won since a   victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the season opener. They’ll look to snap an   losing streak against the reeling Jets ( ) who have lost four straight and were eliminated from playoff contention with Monday’s loss. ” Kaepernick has already done a ton of damage to NFL ratings this year with his deeply unpopular anthem protests. Looking at that matchup against Petty, it appears he’s about to do some more damage. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
