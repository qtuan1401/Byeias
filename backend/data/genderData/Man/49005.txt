’  ’ ’   At Business Insider, we sample a lot of cars, and many of them   are black. ’ ”   Black is a popular color for vehicles these days. In fact,    (citing SwapALease. com) it’s   the most popular color, beating   white   by a wide margin. ” ’   But every once in a while, a black car shows up that redefines   what that commonplace color is all about. ’ ’   This happened to us recently when a Volvo V60 Polestar wagon   landed in our driveway at BI test HQ in suburban New Jersey. ’ ’   There was just something about the ”Onyx Black Metallic” tone   that made it impossible  —   and I’’m not kidding, literally   impossible  —   to look away. This a deep, shimmering black.   Hypnotic almost. ’ ’  ’ ’   No hint of blue or gray or green. Just a deep, nearly bottomless   black.  ’ ”   Having owned several Volvos (none black) I have to reveal that I   think they’ve always done a great job with paint. But the Swedish   car maker, now owned by China’s Geely, outdid itself on our test   car. ” ’   We also quite liked driving the car, so look forward to our   review. ’ ”   Anyway, we’ve had black Volvos before. But we’ve never had one   that just grabbed us at the chromatic level and wouldn’t let go. ”
