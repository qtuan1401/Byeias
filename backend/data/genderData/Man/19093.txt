Guest Roger Stone discussed racist elements of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s past with Breitbart News Daily host Matt Boyle. [Stone said:  There’s plenty on the record here whether it’s the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a severely retarded man, who Bill sent to the electric chair shortly before the 1992 Democratic Primary, or whether it’s the fact that Bill as governor of Arkansas went to Federal Court in order to argue that the Arkansas police should be allowed to racially profile motorists and pull people, essentially, aside for the crime of being black while driving, these people have engaged in very deep dog whistle politics. Continued Stone, “For them to pretend now that that’s not the case is clearly absurd. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
