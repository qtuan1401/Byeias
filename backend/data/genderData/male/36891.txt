 (CNN) When it comes to rugby, few can match the achievements of New Zealand. World champions in the    format twice in succession, it was supposed to add the rugby sevens gold medal to its collection this time around. The problem was that nobody told Fiji. The Pacific Islanders, champions of the   sevens series, claimed a   win on a wet and miserable day in Rio de Janeiro. New Zealand, beaten by Japan and Great Britain in the group stage, has endured a dismal campaign. It lost star player Sonny Bill Williams to a ruptured Achilles injury in the shock defeat by Japan and rarely looked like recovering. And it was finally put out of its misery by Fiji, which scored tries through Osea Kolinisau and Jerry Tuwai. Fiji will face Japan in the last four after it produced yet another shock victory, this time over France. Japan left it late before claiming a   win to keep itself in with a chance of a medal. In the dayâ€™s other quarterfinals Great Britain defeated Argentina   while South Africa overcame Australia  .
