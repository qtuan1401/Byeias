Bruce Jenner announced his support for Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and said he would like to be Ted Cruz’s “trans ambassador” if he becomes president. [According to an interview with Advocate:  Jenner reveals she met Cruz prior to her transition, more than a year ago, “and he was very nice. ” “Wouldn’t it be great, let’s say he goes on to be president,” she tells me in relating a conversation on the tour bus. “And I have all my girls on a trans issues board to advise him on making decisions when it comes to trans issues. Isn’t that a good idea?” she asked me. “You’re going to be Ted Cruz’s trans ambassador?” “Yes, trans ambassador to the president of the United States, so we can say, ‘Ted, love what you’re doing, but here’s what’s going on. ’” “I like Ted Cruz,” she declares. “I think he’s very conservative, and a great constitutionalist, and a very articulate man. I haven’t endorsed him or anything like that. But I also think, he’s an evangelical Christian, and probably one of the worst ones when it comes to trans issues. ” “I get it. The Democrats are better when it comes to these types of social issues. I understand that. ” So why support Republicans? “Number one, if we don’t have a country, we don’t have trans issues. We need jobs. We need a vibrant economy. I want every trans person to have a job. With $19 trillion in debt and it keeps going up, we’re spending money we don’t have. Eventually, it’s going to end. And I don’t want to see that. Socialism did not build this country. Capitalism did. Free enterprise. The people built it. And they need to be given the opportunity to build it back up. ” Read the rest of the story here.
