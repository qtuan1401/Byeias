On the Thursday broadcast of “The Herd” on Fox Sports 1, Jason Whitlock reacted to the report that then St. Louis Rams made a deal with the NFL to draft openly gay Michael Sam out of the University of Missouri in order to not appear on HBO’s “Hard Knocks. ”  Whitlock said he is not surprised by the report, saying the move to draft Sam was merely a “play to the politically correct crowd. ” “Michael Sam was a stunt by the NFL. It was a play to the politically correct crowd. The guy’s too short, not fast enough off the ball, he’s not an NFL player, and I think people did the homework on him and said, ‘You know what, I don’t know if he really, really loves the game. ’” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
