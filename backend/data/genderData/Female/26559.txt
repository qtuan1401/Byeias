During an interview with ABC affiliate WEWS NewsChannel 5 in Cleveland, OH that was released on Tuesday, Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine ( ) stated that the Clinton Foundation is not taking “  contributions” “right now” in response to a question on the Clinton Foundation’s foreign donors.  Kaine was asked about the announcement that the Clinton Foundation wouldn’t accept foreign donations if Clinton was elected, and if they should just cut off foreign contributions now. He answered, “I think it’s now, foreign donations as of now, and then as a president, President Clinton will step aside from his connection with the foundation. So, she’s taking one step forward right now, the foundation is, taking one step forward right now, by saying there’s some  —   there’s no corporations, no   contributions, we’re not taking them right now, and then, if we are successful and are elected, President Clinton will sever the tie with the foundation that he created. ” (  GOP War Room) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
