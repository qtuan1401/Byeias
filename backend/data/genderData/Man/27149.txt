The FBI has released shocking new details about a teenager who disappeared from Myrtle Beach back in 2009. [According to FBI investigators,    Brittanee Drexel was abducted, repeatedly   shot dead and fed to the alligators in a swamp near McClellanville, South Carolina when her disappearance created too much media attention.  The shocking new details about Drexel’s disappearance came from a prison inmate who claims he witnessed the crime along with several other accounts from various witnesses, according to FBI agent Gerrick Munoz’s testimony to a federal court obtained by The Post and Courier. Taquan Brown, who is serving a   sentence for voluntary manslaughter in a different case, claimed that he saw Drexel at a “stash house”  —   a place where guns, drugs or money is stored  —   where he witnessed    Da’Shaun Taylor along with several other men sexually abuse Drexel, Munoz said in his testimony. Brown said that as he walked to the back of the house to give money to Taylor’s father, Shawn Taylor, he noticed Drexel try to escape. Her escape did not last, however, when one of her captors caught her and dragged her back into the house. Brown said he heard two gunshots and later saw her wrapped up body leave the house. Police never found Drexel’s body, but “several witnesses” said her body was dumped in a swamp full of alligators, Munoz said. Munoz’s testimony was part of    Da’Shaun Taylor’s bond hearing, where prosecutors are trying to bring him up on federal charges for a robbery back in 2011. Taylor already confessed and served probation for the robbery, but prosecutors are trying to bring him up on new charges where he could serve a life sentence if convicted. Drexel was last seen on April 25, 2009 at the Blue Water Hotel in Myrtle Beach, where she stayed without her parents’ permission, Fox News reported.
