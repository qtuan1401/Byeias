On Thursday’s “The Herd” on Fox Sports 1, host Colin Cowherd reacted to former New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza being elected into the MLB Hall of Fame on Wednesday, despite some allegations he used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) in his career. Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens are both accused of using PEDs, while Mark McGwire is an admitted user and neither of the three got voted in this year.  Cowherd likened steroid use to Viagra in the porn industry, people stealing ideas in the tech industry and musicians using   and not writing their own lyrics. He also noted Whitey Ford is in the Hall of Fame even though he admitted to doctoring baseballs and that Hall of Famer and first MLB   winner Pud Galvin used testosterone that Cowherd said Babe Ruth also tried. “If you don’t have a complete list of who used and who didn’t, just go to the numbers and let them in because you don’t have a list. And don’t be arrogant enough to think you know who took it and who didn’t. When   first got busted, weren’t we all surprised?” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
