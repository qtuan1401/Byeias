A student at Indiana University has been charged with recording women showering in dorm bathrooms, according to a WGNTV report.  Police report that Donte Montague admitted to using his cell phone to record unaware women on campus. Montague saved the recordings to his phone and then downloaded them on his laptop, police say. After searching the two devices, police found videos of women showering, although they not believe any were posted online. Students said males and females have easy access to each otherâ€™s floors, as well as bathrooms. Montague faces two counts of voyeurism. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
