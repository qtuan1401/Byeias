’  ’ ’   The risk of overconfidence for  is now at its highest point since the company   was founded. ’ ”   The business news cycle for weeks has been dominated by the   carmaker’s surging market cap, which at about $48 billion has   passed both  and . For a brief period, Tesla also climbed above    to become the largest US   automaker by stock valuation. ” ”   As I’ve pointed out a few times, . It’s pure futurism, and anyone   buying in now is betting on a very big payday far down the road   for Musk and his vision. In the short term, Tesla’s traditional   volatility will undoubtedly reappear, so the question isn’t   whether Tesla’s stock will fall, but how far. ” ’   The company itself didn’’t ask for a fat market cap or to be   counted among what observers are now calling the ”Big Four” US   automakers. Rather, Musk and his team have simply been plugging   away on the fairly unglamorous specifics of execution. The   company continues to increase production and sales of the Model S   sedan and the Model X SUV, but more importantly, it’’s gearing up   for the  which is slated for   the end of this year.  ’ ’   If Tesla has a major challenge to confront when its comes to the   ”real”  —   as opposed to financially speculative  —   aspect its   business, it’’s that it has so far shown itself to be pretty bad   at carmaking basics. With the      Model S   and X, this could be forgiven. But with the Model 3, the market   isn’’t going to be so lenient. If Tesla hopes to sell  it needs to get its   assembly lines in order and come up to speed with the rest of the   auto industry. ’ ’  ’ ”   For much of late 2016 and early 2017, Tesla seemed to be     on this mission. The   —   it was   unveiled in March of 2016  —   and Musk and his team has lately been   pointing out that the    crafted from steel rather than aluminum, with far fewer goodies   than the company’s more upmarket offerings.  ” ”   This all makes perfect sense. Nobody should expect a $100, 000   Model S if they’re buying a $35, 000 Model 3. ” ’   But on Thursday, Tesla lost focus, at a very bad time to do   so.  ’ ”   I’m talking about the  which Musk made (naturally) via   Twitter, his preferred   channel.  ” ”   The semi is  which he composed last year. It’s an ambitious   manifesto, taking Tesla from being a   luxury     manufacturer to being  —   as far as its transportation   business goes  —   a purveyor of semis and pickup trucks and the   overseer of a   rethinking of how vehicles are   manufactured. ” ”   The manufacturing piece, involving a radical level of automation,   is right in Musk’s wheelhouse. He’s concentrating on revamping   the  The   truck stuff, on the other hand, is the mother of all   distractions. Especially when it comes to the semi. ” ’  ’ ’   The idea that anyone at Tesla is working on a big   freight vehicle is flatly inexplicable. Tesla is currently   struggling to go from about 100, 000 vehicles in annual production   to five times that in about 12 months. GM, Ford, and FCA have no   involvement in big freight trucks; their businesses are   focused on the consumer part of the market.  ’ ”   True, electrified and potentially autonomous freight transport is   one of those big   ideas that Silicon Valley’s   solutionists have latched onto. The environmental positives of   taking thousands of   semis off the road are   compelling. Truckers might not be too keen on losing their   positions at the wheels of big rigs, but   trucking   startups like Otto are aiming to make that happen. ” ’  ’ ’   Accordingly, Musk wants to make sure that Tesla plays in that   space. Increasingly, he thinks of Tesla as a sort of platform,   not as a ”carmaker” but instead as a  and transportation of every type. What’’s admirable   about this is that his view of how Tesla should function is   reversed engineered from a distant future. What’’s not admirable   is how that vision gums up the   execution of what is   at the moment a manufacturing enterprise that’’s still very much a   work in progress. ’ ”   For example, if Tesla hopes to meet Musk’s goal of producing a   million vehicles a year by 2020, it’s going to need another   factory. The company’s Fremont, Calif. plant, when it was jointly   owned by GM and Toyota back in the 1980s, could produce 500, 000   vehicles annually. ” ”   A   assembly line would require a completely different   manufacturing process from what Tesla is now employing to   construct passenger cars. And we haven’t even gotten to the   actual selling of a semi. Tesla would be going into   a global market that in the US is controlled by freight   specialists and one that’s globally dominated by     firms. ” ’  ’ ”   A Tesla semi would be unquestionably cool, in an        sort of way. In that sense, if it’s   destiny is to advertise Tesla’s ambitions, terrific. But given   that Musk is talking about revealing the thing around the same   time this year that the Model 3 launches, you have to wonder why   he is so devoted to his Master Plan that he can’t come down to   Earth and remind himself that taking on the   for   passenger cars is the biggest challenge he’s ever set for himself   or Tesla. ” ”   As someone who’s followed Tesla for a decade, I’m uncomfortable   with the company pushing in so many different directions. There   have always been two Teslas: the company of today and the company   of tomorrow. Far too often, the tomorrow company has controlled   the story, leaving the today company to bring everything crashing   back to Earth when the gap between the two becomes   apparent.  ” ”   The stock rally of the first half of 2017 has greatly intensified   the attention given to tomorrow Tesla  —   because of course a   $  market cap, unsupported by the actually existing   business, is all about faith in the future. For what it’s worth,   Musk himself may view the stock price with healthy skepticism (he   is, despite his disdain for   prone to see Tesla’s   value as something of a financial fantasy) the CEO isn’t backing   off from his   vision. ” ’  ’ ”   A flintier business would have none of this, but a flintier   businessman wouldn’t be running another company that wants to   colonize Mars. With Musk, you have to take what you get. If you   were a stock taker back in 2010 after the company’s IPO, you’ve   been copiously rewarded. ” ”   But as much money as you’ve made, you’d be right to sound an   alarm about why Tesla can’t seem to maintain its focus at the   company’s most critical times. It almost seems like a dare. All   eyes were on on the Model 3 rollout plan last year when Tesla   announced that it was going to burden its balance sheet by   acquiring SolarCity, for a grand total of about $5 billion   including a huge pile of debt.  ” ”   The   announcement last week was more of the same. I   think Tesla might actually launch the Model 3 ahead of schedule,   but launching and producing are two different things. You can’t   sell 500, 000 vehicles if you can’t build them. And let’s not   forget that Tesla already has about 400, 000   if not   more, for the Model 3. ” ”   I’m not sure that any carmaker in history has even confronted   that much unmet demand with so much unrealized manufacturing   capacity. If customers want to buy 500, 000 Ford vehicles and have   paid $1, 000 a pop for deposits, you can be sure that Ford would   be racing to build those cars. ” ”   Tesla is never less than maddening. But talking about semis when   you’re supposed to be ramping up to take on Volkswagen and Toyota   is downright misguided. ” ’The risk of overconfidence for Tesla is now at. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
