Multiple blasts rocked Brussels Tuesday, with two explosions at the departure hall of the city airport and a further blast at a metro station in town. [So far 34 people are reported to have been killed, with dozens more injured.  Follow our new live wire for latest updates.   Reuters reports: Salah Abdeslam, the prime surviving suspect for November’s Paris attacks, will no longer fight extradition to France but wants to return to his home country to explain himself as soon as possible, his lawyer said on Thursday. “Salah Abdeslam has asked me to inform you that he wishes to leave for France as quickly as possible,” Sven Mary said in comments broadcast on BFM TV, speaking from Brussels.   From Reuters: A “third man” seen with two Islamic State suicide bombers at Brussels Airport was the focus of a Belgian manhunt on Thursday after police identified three others, including two brothers, who killed at least 31 people at the airport and on a city metro train. Netanyahu offered his “deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the recent terrorist attacks in Brussels. ” “I think the point of departure in the battle against terrorism is this: Nothing justifies terrorism  —   absolutely nothing,” he said. “In Paris or Brussels or San Bernardino or Tel Aviv or Jerusalem  —   terror must be condemned equally and it must be fought equally. ”   “Ibrahim El Bakraoui and younger brother Khalid were no strangers to police prior to Tuesday’s suicide bombings in Brussels,” reports NBC News. Among their criminal exploits was a   sentence against Ibrahim in 2010 for shooting at the police with an assault rifle during a robbery, and Khalid getting arrested in 2011 for possession of Kalashnikov rifles, plus a   prison sentence for carjacking. The brothers also narrowly escaped capture on March 15 in a police raid and gun battle at a house Khalid was renting in Brussels.   The Associated Press reports that a group of European and Iraqi intelligence offifcials, along with “a French lawmaker who follows jihadi networks,” warn that ISIS has “trained at least 400 attackers and sent them into Europe. ” “The officials say the fighters have been given orders to find the right time, place and method to carry out their mission,” adds the Associated Press.   The first publicly confirmed victim killed in the Brussels attacks is Adelma Marina Tapia Ruiz, a    Peruvian mother of twin    girls who had been living in Belgium for nine years.  She was on her way to New York to visit relatives.  Her daughters and husband survived the bombing, with shrapnel wounds, because the girls were playing outside the gate area, and Ruiz’s Belgian husband Christopher Delcambe had gone in search of them. Two more victims were identified soon after Ruiz: Belgian law student Leopold Hecht, 20, who was injured at the Metro station and later succumbed to his wounds, and Olivier Delespesse, 45, a civil servant for the Federation of   reportedly killed at the Metro station.

Mr Erdogan said Turkey reported this to Belgian authorities in July 2015 and also notified Dutch authorities. He claims Belgium “ignored” Turkey’s warning that the attacker posed a threat. He does not name the attacker. A Belgian municipal security official from the notorious Molenbeek neighbourhood said he would kill “each and every Jew” in a Facebook debate on Friday. The Times of Israel reports that the officer, named as Mohammed N, wrote: “The word Jew itself is dirty. If I were in Israel, frankly, I would do to the Jews what they do with the Palestinians  —   slaughter each and every one of them. ” The officer was going by the pseudonym Bebeto Gladiateur. The Belgian media says he is a “guardian of the peace”  —   an official who maintains security and deters crime but does not wield police powers.  Polish PM Beata Szydlo has said her country will no longer take in migrants after the Brussels attacks. Reuters reports that Ms Szydlo told TV station Superstacja: “  EU countries agreed to solve the issue through relocation. But I will say it very clearly: I do not see it possible to allow migrants in Poland at the moment. ” BREAKING@haaretzcom reveals that Belgian security received intelligence warning that #ISIS planned attack on   #BrusselsAttacks,  —   Anshel Pfeffer (@AnshelPfeffer) March 23, 2016,  “The security services knew, with a high degree of certainty, that attacks were planned in the very near future for the airport and, apparently, for the underground railway as well,” the paper says. Activists on the No Borders   Calais Migrant Solidarity Facebook page have been discussing whether yesterday’s bombing in Brussels was a “good thing,” as the chaos it caused will have enabled illegal immigrants to cross into the UK. The discussion was prompted by Chiara Lauvergnac, a   “freelance troublemaker” who wrote: “Eurostar to Brussels suspended, Lille airport is taking some of the planes due to land in Brussel airport. It could mean some chaos and good chance some people will go to UK! Sorry there is a good side to everything. ” Gemma Rourke questioned “sorry a good side to people being killed this morning?” to which fellow activist ‘Rojo Red’ replied “Whether it’s a “good side” to people being killed is really irrelevant to me,” adding: “Brussels Eurostar traffic suspended, thus a real possibility of increased traffic at Calais Eurostar. Tell your friends in the Jungle!” Lauvergnac has also used her personal Facebook page to link to two articles suggesting that yesterday’s Islamic terrorist atrocity was a “false flag” operation fabricated by Western leaders, designed to increase support among the public for higher governmental security measures. Another post is of an image which reads “My heart truly bleeds for what happened in Belgium  …     But Palestinians have faced attacks for almost 70 years from Israeli terrorists and the world is still silent. ” ‘Crying Will Not Stop Islamism’  —   Euro MPs Blast European Union Leaders https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2016,  Interpol put out a red notice for Khalid El Bakraoui before the attacks took place, according to the Telegraph.

Home Secretary Theresa May gave statement to the house confirming the UK threat level “remains severe  —   which means an attack is highly likely”. She says UK forces have “disrupted seven terrorist plots to attack the UK” in the last 18 months all of which were linked to Islamic State. She confirmed that the government has taken “precautionary steps” including an increase in “border forces” in France and Belgium with an increased presence at airports and ports. Also that police have increase their presence at transport hubs. She stressed neither of those moves was a response to “specific intelligence”.

Ivar Mol, who tweeted the question yesterday after seeing reports on social media that Muslim children had cheered in response to news of the Belgian attacks, later explained that his question was rhetorical and intended to provoke discussion. He later posted to Facebook: “I’ve just had a call from Paul Depla, mayor of Breda [where Mr Mol lives]. “He swore to me that the three police officers were not sent to me on his behalf. He regrets the incident highly and fully supports the freedom of expression. ” He added: “Although I believe it’s still official that a tweet was considered bad enough to send the police.

He is one of the men wearing one black glove in the   security photo. His brother Khaled blew himself up on the metro train. This means the second   wearing suicide bomber in the photo has not been identified. Police have also found a note written by Ibrahim El Bakraoui, which says: “I do not know what to do. I am on the run, people are looking for me everywhere. If I give myself up I will end up in a cell. ”   Lord Reid, who was Labour Home Secretary until just before the July 7 bombings, spoke to the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show. “It will happen here because the terrorists only have to get through once. “So you can quote the statistics on how many plots have been foiled, but the terrorists will get through. ” Lord Reid said terrorists were now more likely to focus on “soft targets” like the transport network and crowded public places, because the security services had been so successful at preventing “spectacular” plots, for example,   attacks on aircraft. The Telegraph is reporting that Salah Abdeslam’s court appearance has been postponed by a day due to security fears.   “The fact is that Schengen and open borders have brought terrorism to our doorstep. You cannot have security with open borders. You cannot fight terrorism with free movement of Jihadists and Kalashnikovs. “Meantime a Telegraph headline reads “‘Questioning EU’s open borders is inappropriate’ says Cameron”. Sorry Dave.

German press headlines lament the “attack on the heart of Europe” while comments combine calls for stricter security measures with concerns about sacrificing basic freedoms. A commentary in conservative Die Welt criticises Belgium for not raising its alert level until after the attacks and calls for extra funding for a “calm, uncompromising fight against terror”. But   Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in turn criticises those who think the security services could have predicted the attacks, saying that they have an “unenviable task”. “It is a dark day for Europe” it concludes. The liberal Munich paper Sueddeutsche Zeitung urges readers to remember that most victims of terrorism worldwide are Muslims.

The Telegraph quotes Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon saying his government knew “it was always possible that more attacks could happen, but we never could have imagined something of this scale. ” “We had no information about this, but we know that things were moving in Europe, in different countries, in France, in Germany, here,” Jambon said in an interview with RTL television.   Fox News quotes US officials saying at least nine Americans were wounded in the Brussels bombings, including a military officer, five of his relatives, and three Mormon missionaries from Utah. “The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints issued a statement Tuesday identifying the three American missionaries as    Richard Norby of Lehi,    Joseph Empey of Santa Clara and    Mason Wells of Sandy. They were near the explosion when it occurred and have been hospitalized,” Fox reports, adding that their injuries are considered “serious. ” “We have been in touch with him and he is grateful and in good spirits  …     We are thankful for the outpouring of love and prayers from throughout the world, and we pray for all those affected by this tragedy,” said the family of Joseph Empey in a statement. The United States Air Force has confirmed that one of its members, from Joint Force Command Brunssum in the Netherlands, was injured, along with his family.  The victims were not named in the statement.   The mayor of the Zaventem municipality, Francis Vermeiren, spoke about the Brussels airport bombing on Tuesday, as reported by AFP. “They came in a taxi with their suitcases, their bombs were in their bags,” said Vermeiren.  “They put their suitcases on trolleys, the first two bombs exploded. The third also put his on a trolley but he must have panicked, it didn’t explode. ”   ABC News obtained an   image from the Military Hospital in    in northern Brussels, showing a nail or screw from one of the bombs puncturing the lung of an unnamed victim.  Terrorists are fond of packing their bombs with nails, to cause maximum carnage among victims with a cloud of shrapnel.    Sky News reports that Belgian authorities are advising against travel to Brussels, a warning echoed by the British Foreign Office. According to the Military Times, at least one American service member and his family were injured in the attack.  During Tuesday morning hearings in the US House of Representatives, it was said that at least six American citizens were injured, including five military family members. “On Tuesday EUCOM imposed travel restrictions on essentially all troops in Europe, ordering them to stay out of Brussels,” Military Times reported. The EUCOM policy statement also applied to “DOD civilian employees, contractors, and   dependents and family members,” but not to “military personnel assigned to diplomatic posts in Belgium. ” CNN reports Brussels public transit systems are essentially on lockdown, with the exception of a few select tram and bus lines, Eurostar rail service has been suspended until Wednesday, the airport is closed, and flights are being diverted away from Brussels. “Brussels Airport has been shot in the heart,” said its CEO, Arnaud Feist.  “We’d like to thank the police and rescue services and the people present at the terminal. ”   The British Foreign Office has announced that at least two Britons were injured in the Brussels bombings. “We are in close contact with local authorities in Brussels following the shocking attacks that have taken place, and we stand together with the Belgian people at this time. Embassy staff are providing consular assistance to two injured Britons and are ready to support any further British nationals that have been affected. British nationals should follow the advice of local security authorities and check our travel advice for updates,” said the Foreign Office, as quoted by the Telegraph.   The UK Telegraph reports raids were still ongoing after five hours in the Schaerbeek district of Brussels, which has “emerged as another jihadist hub,” alongside the infamous Molenbeek district. “Schaerbeek, in the   of the Belgian capital, is the site of the Paris bomb factory discovered a month after the November 13 attacks in the French capital, and it is the childhood home of the suspected bombmaker, Najim Laachroui,” the Telegraph reports.  It is hypothesized that Laachroui, who received his bomb training in Syria, may have been the man led away by police earlier today, and might be the man in the   jacket depicted in security camera footage from the Brussels airport. “Schaerbeek is also the   of Abdeslam’s brother, Brahim, who blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire brasserie in Paris. His funeral was held there last week. ” The Telegraph describes Schaerbeek’s south side as “impoverished” and a “mainly immigrant area, home to Moroccans and people from central and west Africa. Its back streets are dilapidated and rundown, with shops selling   clothes and cheap kebabs. ” This area sits uneasily alongside eastern Schaerbeek, which is “becoming increasingly popular with young   families, attracted by its affordable property prices and convenient location. ”   “If I become Dutch Prime Minister next year I’ll crush Islamic terrorism, close our national borders and   The Netherlands,” said Dutch Party For Freedom leader Geert Wilders on Twitter Tuesday afternoon.   House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) led his chamber in a moment of silence “in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks in Brussels. ”   After reporting earlier about elevated security measures in major cities across the United States, CNN adds that the Transportation Security Agency is “deploying terror deterrent teams to major airports and train stations nationwide, in response to the Brussels attack. ”   From NBC News and CNN come beautiful shots of the Eiffel Tower lit with the colors of the Belgian flag, in solidarity with the people of Brussels.    King Philippe of Belgium made a brief televised address to the nation, in which he said he and Queen Mathilde “share your pain, the pain of those who lost their loved ones and who suffered in this cowardly and horrible act of terrorism. ” “We express our support for the rescue and security services members, we express our appreciation to those who offered their help spontaneously,” the King continued.  “We shall continue to respond firmly, calmly, and with dignity when faced with a threat.  We shall remain confident.  Our strength lies in this confidence. ” The Associated Press reports that Belgian prosecutors say “a new explosive device containing nails” was found during a Brussels search operation. This was evidently the raid reported by the UK Telegraph, at an address in the Schaerbeek neighborhood, as police searched for “the man in the hat and   jacket shown in the photograph of the three suspects at the airport. ”  An arrest was made on the premises, but it’s not known if this was the man from the photo. Sky News reports an ISIS flag, and some sort of “chemical products,” were also recovered in the raid. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel mourned the “broken lives in full flight  …     cut down by the most extreme barbarity” at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. “Maximum level alert 4 is confirmed,” said the Prime Minister.  “The crisis centre and security services we have taken several extra measures. I confirm the presence of our soldiers, of tighter border controls with neighboring countries, and everything is being done to   public transport progressively. ” “I want to tell those who have chosen to be the barbarous enemies of freedom, democracy and fundamental values that we will remain united, together and totally mobilised, with a deep pain in our bellies and our hearts but the total determination to protect our freedoms, to protect our way of life,” he continued. “It is important to return to normal life as soon as possible. Freedom was struck in its heart this morning in Brussels as Paris was a few months ago, as London or Spain were in their turn. This is a common fight. ”   Belgian PM Charles Michel told a press conference: “The crisis centre and security services we have taken several extra measures. I confirm the presence of our soldiers, of tighter border controls with neighboring countries, and everything is being done to   public transport progressively. ” BREAKING: Belgian federal prosecutor says believes two attackers blew up at Brussels airport, third being hunted. https:  .   —   Reuters Top News (@Reuters) March 22, 2016,  Geert Wilders On Brussels Attacks For Breitbart: ‘We Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet’ https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 22, 2016,  You’ll notice two of the suspects are dressed almost identically, including wearing gloves on one hand but not the other.

Part of the city  —   especially Molenbeek  —   is a cesspit of Islamic extremism. The authorities have been content to let such areas fester and until recently the police were noticeable by their absence. Quite aside from the   suicide bombers, a whole crescent (suitably enough) along the   seaboard of Europe has proved fertile ground for the Arab European League, a violently   and   Islamist movement which has attracted scant attention, despite its typically vile programme. From Lille in the south, via Brussels, Antwerp, The Hague all the way to Rotterdam, whole towns and suburbs have Muslim populations in excess of 40 per cent. Political parties which have opposed this colonisation (such as Vlaams Belang) are excluded from government and denied airtime.

The Holy Father again condemns the blind violence which causes so much suffering and imploring from God the gift of peace, he entrusts on the bereaved families and the Belgians the benefit of divine blessings.  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has blamed “flabbly liberalism” for encouraging terrorists because Britain’s elite “feels guilty”.

Radical Islam is at war with us. For over seven years we have had a president who refuses to acknowledge this reality. And the truth is, we can never hope to defeat this evil so long as we refuse to even name it. That ends on January 20, 2017, when I am sworn in as president.

Cavusoglu called for European countries not to release those suspected of being international fighters, as they do not deserve the freedom to travel. “Those who carried out the Paris attacks, essentially, were people that we had caught and handed over to Belgium,” he said. “There can be no freedom to travel for terrorists,” he added. “If you release them, they become unpredictable. ” Speaking to AIPAC via satellite, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to the families of those murdered in the terrorist attacks in Brussels. “The chain of attacks from Paris to San Bernardino to Istanbul, to the Ivory Coast and now to Brussels and the daily attacks in Israel. This is one continuous assault on all of us. In all these cases the terrorists have no resolvable grievances. It’s not as if we could offer them Brussels or Istanbul or California or even the West Bank. That won’t satisfy their grievances because what they seek is our utter destruction and their total domination. Their basic demand is that we should simply disappear.

Remarking that the attack is a symptom of failed multiculturalism, Dr. Mendoza said: “the idea of allowing people to come into your society and to act as they please, rather than adapting has failed. We need to say when you come to our society we expect you to act in this way, and we will force you to act in this way. This is what Europeans did with every previous migrant wave, but we have stopped doing it. “Arguments for BREXIT include the idea that you need controls of your borders  …     We have a problem in Britain where people have become radicalised. To say migration is purely responsible for such attacks is a red herring. The people who want to attack the United Kingdom don’t live in France or Belgium. They already live here. “We need to get every available military option onto the streets to stabilise the situation and to give the people confidence in the authorities. And that means a very harsh response by the authorities to make sure there are no more attacks. What we know is that as soon as one attack is successful another one is planned immediately, as those people move to build on momentum”.

IS supporters have in the past used   hashtags to celebrate IS attacks, such as “#Parisonfire” to celebrate IS’s 13 November attacks in Paris.

Speaking to Breitbart Radio, he told the network: “I was in my apartment which is 100 feet from the tube station, just across the road. I heard a loud noise which I initially thoughts was a car backfiring, but then the whole building rocked. “I came out of the building and went across to the tube and there were people moving away very quickly. Belgian police were there in five minutes, an officer ushering us back to our flats, telling us to get indoors. “I decided I couldn’t stay there, so I walked the five minutes to the EU buildings. By that time there were a dozen officers, and we were pushed up the street by police.

They were clearly very important judging by how they were getting waved through to the scen, e. “As t, he road cleared an army lorry full of solders passed me, heading toward the scene. “At that time of day you have thousands of people getting off trains to go to the Commission, heading to the restaurants and coffee shops.

He remarked: “There have been huge failings [in security] and it is unclear that the city is unsafe  …     if you have a man who has masterminded a plot that has killed so many people in Paris, and he is able to go back to Brussels and live in an area where terrorists are known to live, and the police only eventually catch him by accident because they are tailing someone else this shows a massive security failing by the European Union”. Russian President Vladimir Putin has condemned what he called “barbaric acts” in Brussels, Russian news agency Interfax reports, quoting his press secretary Dmitry Peskov. “The president resolutely condemned these barbaric acts, expressed his condolences to the Belgian people and assured King Philippe of absolute solidarity with the Belgians in these difficult hours,” Libération newspaper is reporting that the border between France and Belgium has been closed to all traffic, including road traffic.

The number of officers deployed will be regularly assessed. These additional officers are deployed as part of reassurance measures. “The police presence across London and the rest of the UK is constantly under review, “We are in close liaison with the Belgium authorities and will continue to monitor the situation. “The threat to the UK from international terrorism remains at severe as it has been since August 2014, meaning an attack is highly likely. “We urge the public and businesses to be alert but not alarmed and report anything suspicious to the confidential   Hotline on 0800 789 321. In an emergency always call 999. ” Speaking to Breitbart Radio this morning Herman Kelly, who was in the European Commission buildings when the bombs went off said Europe’s policy of free movement of people meant in reality “free movement for fighters”. He remarked: “The head of EUROPOL (European Police) said there are 5, 000 Jihadists at large in the EU, having slipped in from Syria.

This is amazing to me that these people can kill people abroad, come here, and then walk free in the centre of Brussels. “Free movement of people in Europe allows these people to travel across Europe, to move their explosives and guns across the EU. It means free movement for fighters, for guns. It allows them to move at will”.
