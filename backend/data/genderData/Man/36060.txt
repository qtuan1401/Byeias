 (CNN) Since declaring its caliphate in June 2014, the   Islamic State has conducted or inspired more than 140 terrorist attacks in 29 countries other than Iraq and Syria, where its carnage has taken a much deadlier toll. Those attacks have killed at least 2, 043 people and injured thousands more. It can be difficult to divine the precise role that international terrorists play in this or that attack. For example, the person who killed four U. S. Marines and a sailor in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July 2015 was ”motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda,” FBI Director James Comey said, though he added that it’s hard to say which terrorist group motivated the killer. It also can be hard to get precise information about some attacks, but it’s clear the deadly tentacles of ISIS have spread quickly from the terrorist group’s epicenter in Iraq and Syria to points around the globe. Here’s a look at terrorist attacks outside Iraq and Syria believed to have been inspired or conducted by ISIS or its regional affiliates, along with context about the known connections to ISIS: NORTH AMERICA, October 20, 2014    Martin   runs over two soldiers, killing one, outside a government office in     Quebec.   had converted to Islam and expressed support for ISIS online.

May 3, 2015    Two men open fire outside a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in a Dallas suburb. The gunmen, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, wound a security guard before police shoot and kill them. Simpson linked himself to ISIS in a tweet posted before the attack, according to a federal law enforcement source.  The keynote speaker at the event was   Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who was on an al Qaeda hit list. At least one of the gunmen appeared to have been in contact with an ISIS operative in Syria via social media. ISIS claimed responsibility, describing the attackers as ”soldiers of the caliphate,” according to the Institute for the Study of War. The institute described the attack as ”” and U. S. officials said the group probably was being ”opportunistic” in claiming responsibility. The attack is believed to have been inspired by ISIS.

The    team had developed extremist views as early as 2013, a time that predates the rise of ISIS, FBI Director Comey has said. And Farook tried to contact other terrorist groups, a senior law enforcement official said. ”Individuals inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham (ISIS) and with links to al Qaeda conducted the terrorist attack,” according to the Institute for the Study of War. ”This attack was the first al   or   in the U.

President Obama said there was no evidence the attacker was under direction from a terrorist network, or carrying out any group’s larger plot.

The head was tied to the factory’s fence, along with two flags bearing ”the Islamist profession of faith,” authorities said.  ”We can note that this perfectly matches ISIS’ watchword, which regularly calls for committing terrorist attacks on the French territory, and to precisely slit the throats of the nonbelievers,” Molins said. ”The beheading also precisely recalls this terrorist organization’s modus operandi.” The attack is believed to have been inspired by ISIS.
