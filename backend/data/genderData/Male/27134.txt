Chicago police are investigating to find out how    Michael Arquero —  “a convicted felon and documented gang member” —  was able to get a concealed carry permit.  Arquero’s possession of a concealed permit came to police attention after he shot and killed another man in   on September 10. According to the Associated Press, “Arquero was at a taco stand when    Louis Rodriguez opened fire from a passing [vehicle] wounding Arquero. ” Arquero then “returned fire” and killed Rodriquez. Although he shot in   Arquero was “charged with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and ordered held on $2 million bond. ” The investigation into how Arquero obtained a concealed permit is ongoing. However, Illinois State Police have determined that he has at least one alias and that his gang affiliation is tied to it. Under that same alias —  Michael Trivasano —  Arquero also has “multiple convictions with gun charges. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
