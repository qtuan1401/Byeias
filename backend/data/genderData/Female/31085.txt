Someone close to Katie Couric says the former morning show host regrets the insertion of an   pause in her gun control film, Under the Gun, to make it appear as if   advocates could not properly answer a question. [Breitbart News previously reported that the pause  —   inserted to delay responses to Couric’s background check question  —   gave the impression that   individuals were stumped or unsure how to respond to the topic of gun control.  Audio and video obtained by The Washington Free Beacon proved beyond a doubt that the   responses were given immediately after Couric asked the question, yet the film makes it look like the respondents sat in silence for nearly ten seconds, trying to ascertain how to respond.  Raw audio of the scene in question clearly shows the gun advocates immediately addressing Couric’s question: According to The Wrap, Couric now regrets the insertion of the pause: “This was an unnecessary mistake. It did not represent editing someone’s sentences. There was no factual error. This is not a mistake that is a substantive mistake,” a source close to Couric told the outlet. “It could have been avoided. This was a poor decision that was made, and it involves silence. ” Breitbart News previously reported that Couric’s film also omitted a   interview with gun scholar John Lott, Jr. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
