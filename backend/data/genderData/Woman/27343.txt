On Saturday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) responded to criticism of some of his comments on the Black Lives Matter movement by arguing the group instigates violence, and “hasn’t saved anywhere near as many black lives, if they’ve saved any at all, than I have. ”  Giuliani said, “Well, if stating the truth is being a racist, then we’re in a very sad situation in this country.   …     When I was mayor of New York, I took, over 1, 924 murders, the year before I was mayor, I brought it down to about 500. Mike Bloomberg brought it down to about 300. I calculate that I saved about 7 or 8 thousand black lives, Bloomberg and I together, maybe 12, 000. There are no two mayors that ever saved more black lives in any city, any place in the country. Black Lives Matter hasn’t saved anywhere near as many black lives, if they’ve saved any at all, than I have. And where are they? Where’s Black Lives Matter when six kids get shot in Chicago, by other black kids? The reality is, that we’re going to only end this whole issue, when we get control of the significant amount of violence in urban America. I’m not talking about the rest of the country. I’m talking about urban America, within the black community. ” Giuliani later added that Black Lives Matter is “instigators of violence. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
