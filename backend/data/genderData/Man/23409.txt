Fox Sports 1 analyst Jason Whitlock called ESPN, “EPCN,” citing the   sports giant’s slavish catering to political correctness. Whitlock believes political correctness is costing, “ESPN viewers and providing an opening for FS1 to reach   viewers mostly ignored by national networks. ”[The Sporting News did an   profile of Whitlock and his show “Speak for Yourself” which he   alongside Colin Cowherd on FS1, discussing Whitlock’s desire to move away from the “Embrace Debate” style of sports television entertainment format which essentially involves two hosts screaming, gesticulating, and eyeing each other suspiciously.  The piece delves into Whitlock’s views on how ESPN’s political correctness runs counter to the true culture of sports. Whitlock explains, “Sports culture is not PC or far left. There are no safe spaces in the field of competition. I think we can differentiate ourselves from EPCN by discussing sports in a way that is authentic to sports culture and sports fans. You can be authentic without being distasteful or disrespectful. Sports culture has long been patriotic, tolerant of diverse backgrounds and perspective and celebratory of meritocracy. ” True to his words, Whitlock hasn’t taken kindly to Colin Kaepernick’s offenses toward the patriotic culture of sports. Whitlock has, hilariously, titled Kaepernick, “Martin Luther Cornrow”: I’ve watched this show quite a bit and Whitlock doesn’t just talk the   talk, he walks the walk. One of the first things that becomes evident when hearing him discuss social issues is his complete disregard for anyone’s feelings. Whitlock simply wants to find out the truth, and doesn’t care whether or not that truth conforms to any   worldview or if that truth offends anyone. He simply wants to find out the truth and talk about it. That’s how journalism should work. It’s also probably why Whitlock no longer works for ESPN. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
