 (CNN) Ariana Grande is sorry. The singer posted an apology video on Thursday amid backlash from a video in which she appears to lick doughnuts in a shop south of Los Angeles and says she hates America. ”Seeing a video of yourself behaving poorly, that you have no idea was taken, is such a rude awakening, that you don’t know what to do    I was so disgusted with myself,” she said. ”Not here to make any excuses or justify my behavior, because I can’t. . .. I’m just here to apologize.” In the video, originally released to TMZ, the    celebrity seems to stealthily touch the doughnuts with her tongue before jumping up and down, laughing. Then, when an employee approaches with a tray full of doughnuts, the singer turns to a male companion and says loudly, ”What the f*** is that? I hate Americans. I hate America.” Now, authorities are investigating, according a statement by the Lake Elsinore Police Department. The singer tweeted an apology of sorts after the video went viral on social media. ”I am EXTREMELY proud to be an American,” she wrote. ”What I said in a private moment . .. was taken out of context and I am sorry for not using more discretion with my choice of words.” But instead of addressing the incident, Grande only added that she felt ”very upset” about the food habits of Americans and was ”frustrated” by child obesity rates.  On social media, #WeForgiveYouAriana trended as fans reached out. But not everyone was buying it. Actor Rob Lowe tweeted that Grande’s excuse for licking the doughnuts was ”#lame.” ”It is not clear at this time if the affected donuts were disposed of or sold to another patron,” a police statement said. Health officials also announced they would investigate the doughnut shop to see why the baked goods were left exposed to the public, a violation of local food safety codes.
