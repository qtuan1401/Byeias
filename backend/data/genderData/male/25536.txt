Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said “the rules should change” to prevent people from doing what she did with her emails in an interview with Des Moines, IA’s, NBC affiliate, Channel 13 WHO, broadcast on Sunday’s “News Today In Iowa. ”  Hillary asked, “We have another weekend here where people are kind of seeing these fresh stories about the emails.   …     When you’re president, will you allow anyone to do what you did?” She answered, “Well, it was allowed then, but I think the rules should change, because of all of the confusion and the questions. The facts have remained the same. I took classification very seriously. There is absolutely no evidence that I ever sent or received any email marked classified, that has not changed. This is an argument about classification in retrospect. ” She then compared her situation to someone driving the speed limit, but then being ticketed retroactively after the speed limit was lowered for something that wasn’t speeding at the time. Hillary added that she has been calling to release all the emails, and while there has been “background noise. There’s no change in everything that we’ve saying for months. ” She further argued that classification battles go on “all the time. There’s nothing unique about what is being done. Other than I’m the one who said, ‘Release everything. I want everybody to see it. Disclose it. Make it public.’ So, the arguments that are part of the    processing of these information requests is just now being played out in a political context because I’m running for president. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
