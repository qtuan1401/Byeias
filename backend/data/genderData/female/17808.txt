A Hillary Clinton aide derisively referred to campaign chairman John Podesta as part of the “Red Army” for supporting a $15 minimum wage, according to emails released by Wikileaks. [“John Podesta (and the Red Army) want to support $15! ,” Clinton aide Jake Sullivan wrote to Clinton friend and informal policy adviser Neera Tanden in April 2015.  “And when you say Red Army, you mean the base of the Democratic party, right? ,” Tanden replied with a smiley face. “Just want to be clear here. ” “Substantively, we have not supported $15  —   you will get a fair number of liberal economists who will say it will lose jobs,” Tanden explained. “Most of rest seems fine (obviously trade sticks out). Politically, we are not getting any pressure to join this from our end. I leave it to you guys to judge what that means for you. But I’m not sweating it. ” Clinton appears to support a $12 minimum wage but her campaign also praises local fights for $15.
