An east Texas man told police he fell off the roof of a home while he was having sex with his neighbor’s wife. He told the officer he had sex with her because his wife had cheated with the woman’s husband. [A police officer in Lufkin, Texas, came upon a naked man covering himself with a piece of carpet. The man had bloody scratches on his body and seemed “paranoid and twitchy,” the ArkLATex news reported.  The police officer approached the naked man and asked him about his condition. Officers said the man told him he had fallen off the roof of a house while having sex with a woman who was not his wife. The police report states that Ricky Dale Brimer, Jr. 31, admitted to police that he had done methamphetamine and the synthetic marijuana K2 earlier in the day. It appeared he was still under the influence of the drugs at the time. Police arrested Brimer, who has a long criminal history according to records obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Angelina County District Clerk’s Office. Those charges include family violence with bodily injury, drug possession, sexual assault of a child, engaging in organized criminal activity and drug possession. The arrest report states that Brimer claimed he had revenge sex with his friend’s wife on the roof of the home “because his friend had sexual relations with his wife,” the Houston Chronicle reported. Police officers reported that a witness did not see a woman on the roof of the house with Brimer. The neighbor brought Brimer a pair of pants to wear before he was taken into custody. Brimer was checked out medically and then taken to a local jail where he faces a new charge of public intoxication.
