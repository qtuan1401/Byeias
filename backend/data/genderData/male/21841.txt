Monday on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show,” presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton questioned the motivations of her opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) attempting to convert   super delegates and retake the nomination from Clinton.  According to Clinton, such a move would undermine “the will of the people. ” “I find it perplexing,” Clinton said when asked by host Rachel Maddow. “What he basically seems to be saying is that the will of the people should be overturned. I have this very substantial lead in the popular vote, more than 3 million votes. That means more than 3 million Democrats and others voting in Democratic contests have chosen me. I have a very significant lead in pledged delegates. He’s basically seems to be suggesting that super delegates should overturn the will of the people. That is just hard for me to understand. It’s never happened before. It’s not going to happen this time. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
