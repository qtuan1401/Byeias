Pop star Lady Gaga posted an American flag   swimsuit photo to her Instagram account Tuesday in support of Hillary Clinton ahead of the California state primary election. [Before Clinton claimed victory in Tuesday’s contest, Gaga took to social media to urge her 17 million Instagram followers to “VOTE for the first female US president in history. ”   #HILLARY2016 Nothing can keep a strong woman down. VOTE for the first  female US president in history. Shake it up America, this country needs a little rock n’ roll. 🇺🇸🙏🏽🏽 A photo posted by Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) on Jun 7, 2016 at 11:57am PDT,  “#HILLARY2016 Nothing can keep a strong woman down,” the pop star’s post read. “VOTE for the first female US president in history. Shake it up America, this country needs a little rock n’ roll. ” The   love affair dates back years. In 2011, the singer defended Clinton against fashion icon Tim Gunn, who said the former secretary of state’s pantsuits incite gender confusion. “You know, I think Hillary Clinton has more important things to worry about than her hemline. ” Gaga said, defending Clinton during an episode of The View. The presumptive Democratic nominee returned the favor in 2015, writing an essay for Billboard praising women in the music industry and namedropping Gaga in the process. “My hope is that women and girls around the world will hear these artists’ songs, learn their stories and feel a greater sense of  possibility for their own lives. Maybe they’ll recognize  themselves in these women,” Clinton wrote. “Maybe they’ll stand a little straighter or speak a little louder because that’s what Gaga and Missy and Brittany and Tori and Selena and Demi and Kelsea and Lana and Ally and Normani and Lauren and Camilla and Dinah and Loretta would do. ” Last month the “Poker Face” singer tweeted Mother’s Day best wishes to Clinton, using the social media hashtag #HillaryBeOurMama. Happy Mother’s Day @HillaryClinton. This country needs a mother and you’re it. 🙏🏽❤️ #HillaryBeOurMama,  —   Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) May 8, 2016,  Clinton, who has struggled to garner support from young women voters, has also been endorsed by other female pop stars including Cher and Christina Aguilera, who both performed at Clinton’s “She’s With Us”   concert on Monday.
