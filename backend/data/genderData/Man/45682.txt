’’ ’Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer promised  the hip blogging site, when she acquired it for $1. 1 billion in 2013.’ ”But on Tuesday, Yahoo acknowledged that the acquisition hasn’t quite been the success it had hoped.” ”Yahoo took a $230 million write down on Tumblr and said that the site hadn’t met its revenue targets.” ’The write down was part of a hefty $4. 5 billion goodwill impairment that Yahoo recorded  with much of the charges stemming from its businesses in the US, Europe, Canada and Latin America. ’ ’Yahoo noted that $3. 3 billion of the write downs were from acquisitions that occured before 2012, meaning that they were deals that were done before Mayer was CEO. ’ ’Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman said that Tumblr had missed its 2015 revenue target, which called for the site to generate $100 million. ’ ”Yahoo isn’t giving up on Tumblr. In fact, Tumblr is one of the three pillars that Yahoo is building  as the company announced on Tuesday. ” ’But the fact that it is writing down some of Tumblr is an acknowledgment that the biggest and flashiest acquisition made by Mayer has not lived up to expectations. ’
