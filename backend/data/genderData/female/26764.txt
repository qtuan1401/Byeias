Starting September 16, the Towson Town Center in Maryland will require a curfew for anyone 17 years old and younger, a measure the NAACP and other organizations call discriminatory. [“I think that they need to take a look at how to handle this in a different kind of way, other than just to say they are going to stand at the door and bar people. It’s illegal to do that,” said Tessa   president of the NAACP Baltimore branch.  The mall’s general manager said the age policy was not spurred by any particular incident, and is meant to improve shoppers’ consumer experience. Off duty police and public safety officers will check IDs at every mall entrance after 5:00 p. m. on Friday and Saturday. Towson Town Center’s curfew requirements are neither unique nor new  —   nor have other examples been deemed discriminatory. Mall of America, the   mall in the U. S. has a Parental Escort Policy, which says that “on Friday and Saturday evenings youth under the age of 16 must be accompanied by an adult 21 years or older from 4 p. m. until close. ” Meant to increase safety during peak shopping seasons, mall curfews have been around for decades.

It’s only those times at night when we’ve had problems with large crowds gathering at the mall,” said Councilman David Marks. According to the CBS affiliate in Baltimore, at least three other malls in the area have placed restrictions on teen shoppers. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson.
