Fed up with the   American political system, musician, motivational speaker, party connoisseur, and life commentator Andrew W. K. has announced the formation of his own political party. [The multitalented, famously nonpartisan musician launched the “Party Party” this week with a mission: “To free the American people from the dysfunction that is our two party system. ”  Andrew W. K. laid out his goals in a video: While the timing of the announcement is suspect (just before April Fools’ Day) the    partier is seemingly sincere in his quest to unite a divided country: This polarizing form of government has contributed to an adversarial mentality among voters and politicians. The binary ‘Us versus Them,’ ‘Red versus Blue,’ ‘Right versus Left’ mindset has been a perpetual distraction and distorted our shared quest to make tangible improvements to our country and ourselves. Constantly battling and blaming each other has hindered our ability to collectively and individually contribute towards the true destiny of the United States of America: the complete and total liberation of the human spirit. The rocker adds: “Buried deep inside this mountain of overwhelming national anxieties, complex international dilemmas, and endlessly competing principals, there is a fundamental truth  —   that we are all in this together. ” A message on the Party Party’s website asked visitors to sign an online petition to “let the Secretary of State know that you want to help officially qualify The Party Party. ” On Friday, the site announced it had received enough signatures to qualify as a political party, and declared: “HERE WE COME WASHINGTON!”
