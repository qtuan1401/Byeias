Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta received intelligence that President Barack Obama was the beneficiary of voter fraud in his primary run against Clinton, according to Wikileaks’ dump of Podesta’s emails. [Podesta warned Clinton campaign officials in a May 2015 email that the “Obama forces” likely committed voter fraud. Those same “Obama forces,” of course, are now in Clinton’s camp, with Obama endorsing Clinton in the 2016 race.  Podesta wrote: High importance. I met with Jim and Mike in Denver. They are both old friends of the Clintons and have lots of experience. Mike hosted our Boulder Road Show event. They are reliving the 08 caucuses where they believe the Obama forces flooded the caucuses with ineligible voters. They want to organize lawyers for caucus protection, election protection and to raise hard $. They are not just Colorado focused and have good contacts in the region Mike is likely to talk to WJC about this in the near future. Marlon and Brynne, can you respond to the org chart request and give them some points of contact. Marc can you reach out to them on the lawyer election protection issues. Thanks. “Yep Brynne lets loop Jessy and David on our end John will let you know when done,” Clinton campaign staffer Marlon Marshall wrote back.
