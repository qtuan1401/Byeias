Actress and Girls showrunner Lena Dunham came under fire on social media Friday after attributing sexist comments to NFL player Odell Beckham, Jr. during an interview with fellow actress Amy Schumer  —   but Beckham never made the comments, because Dunham and Beckham did not interact with each other during the time the actress describes. [In the interview, published in Dunham’s “Lenny” newsletter Friday morning, the    actress described the time she and New York Giants wide receiver Beckham spent sitting together during the Met Ball earlier this year.  “I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr. and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, ‘That’s a marshmallow. That’s a child. That’s a dog.’ It wasn’t mean  —   he just seemed confused,” Dunham said. Dunham continued by apparently projecting sexist thoughts onto Beckham Jr.: “The vibe was very much like, ‘Do I want to f*ck it? Is it wearing a   …     yep, it’s wearing a tuxedo. I’m going to go back to my cell phone.’ It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, ‘This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes. ’” It wasn’t clear if the   wide receiver said or intimated any of the things Dunham claims. Social media users were quick to criticize and mock the actress for putting words in Beckham’s mouth. Lena Dunham just really tried to slam Odell Beckham jr.

It’s my sense of humor, which has kept me alive for 30 years.  —   Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) September 2, 2016,  Glad the outrage machine roars on though, right @amyschumer?  —   Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) September 2, 2016,  ps I’ll try and dance myself onto @michaelb4jordan if I have the chance, even when I’m a married grandma.
