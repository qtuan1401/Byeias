Philadelphia (CNN) A huge thunderstorm has forced hundreds of journalists out of a media tent next to the Wells Fargo Center    the host of the Democratic National Convention.  Water is dripping into the media tent, soaking electrical equipment, reporters there said on Twitter.   Journalists were advised shortly after 7 p. m. ET that the media tent, which was set up as a workspace for the hundreds of journalists on hand for the convention, was not suited to withstand a direct lightning strike.  They were directed into Lincoln Financial Field, the home of the Philadelphia Eagles football team and near the Wells Fargo Center, the home of the NBA’s 76ers and host venue for the convention.  The storm had winds of up to 50 miles per hour and heavy rain, according to the National Weather Service. A flash flood warning is in place in Philadelphia through midnight.  It capped off a day of complaints from journalists about the DNC’s logistics in Philadelphia    particularly compared to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week.
