Russian special forces used a weaponized robot to take out an Islamic State leader named Rustan Aselderov (also known as Sheikh Abu Muhammad  ) controlling the the robot to fire its mounted machine gun into Aseldrov’s hideout while special forces secured the area. [“Soldiers are seen unloading their weapons on the building before launching two explosive devices inside,” wrote the Sun. “A small weaponised robotic vehicle is then seen moving in to finish the job. The robot’s mounted machine gun blasts holes through the side of the property as soldiers secure the area. ”  Aseldrov and four others were all killed during the raid. In July, Dallas police were the first law enforcement agency in the United States to use a robot to neutralize a suspect. Micah Xavier Johnson was killed after he ambushed police, which left five officers dead and seven civilians injured, with the police department fitting a small explosive device to a robot which was then controlled and detonated near Johnson.
