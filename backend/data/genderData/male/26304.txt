Colin Powell shared his unvarnished opinion of the Clintons, in an email he sent to Democratic financier Jeffrey Leeds in 2014. [Powell described Hillary Clinton as having “a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, and not transformational. ”  He also described Bill Clinton as “still dicking bimbos at home,” apparently citing reports from the New York Post.  “I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect,” Powell wrote in the email to Leeds. Emails from Powell’s personal address were hacked and leaked on the website DCLeaks. com. The email was first reported by Will Rahn, a managing editor for politics at CBS News.
