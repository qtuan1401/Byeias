Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton invoked the “cone of friendship silence” when she was asked about the most meaningful conversation she’s had with a black friend. [The question was asked by ESPN’s Kevin Merida during Clinton’s appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists on Friday.  Clinton invoked the names of many of her African American women friends on her campaign, including one of her best friends in college, but did not answer the question. “Oh my gosh, well I could tell you that I am blessed to have a crew of great friends,” she said. Clinton said that her back friends had both chastised her in conversations and even “tried to expand my musical tastes. ” “I’m going to respect the cone of friendship silence, but please know I’ve got a lot of great friends who have given me so much more,” she said.
