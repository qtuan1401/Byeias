[Palestinian preacher Abdallah Ayed also beseeched Allah “to vanquish America and Russia. ”  “Oh Allah, blow up their capital cities and their planes, pulverize their ships and kill their soldiers,” Ayed said. “Oh Allah, we ask you to subjugate them and burn them  …     burn all they have with your fire. ” The video of Ayed’s prayer, translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) was posted on the Muslim holiday of Eid al Adha.
