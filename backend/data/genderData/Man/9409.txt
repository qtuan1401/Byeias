Microphone issues before the third game of the Stanley Cup playoffs between the Anaheim Ducks and the Edmonton Oilers forced those in attendance to improvise at Edmonton’s Rogers Place Sunday.  Country singer Brett Kissel was supposed to sing the U. S. national anthem, but when he noticed the microphone was not working, he led the packed Canadian crowd in singing the “  Banner” together. The Ducks went on to win the game   putting them down   in the seven game series. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
