Pharrell Williams has defied critics from the   Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and announced a   concert for Tel Aviv this summer. [The man who gave his signature tunes to the film hit Despicable Me and picked up multiple Grammy awards for his solo work will perform at Rishon Live Park, near Tel Aviv, on July 26, 2016. The video below has been released ahead of the gig:   Promoters promise that he will perform songs from every phase of his career, which began in the early 1990s with the group the Neptunes. The concert shows that Williams will not be deterred by BDS activists who just last year sent him  an open letter following talk at the time that he would be performing in Tel Aviv, saying that he seems “to be indifferent to the suffering of Palestinian children, who are denied the most basic human rights by Israel. ”
