The NY Post reports: How many special agents does it take to escort Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, to the bathroom? Around 20. [On Tuesday, Bibi, in New York for the UN General Assembly, caused a stir at upscale restaurant Harry Cipriani at the   hotel by arriving with an    team of buff agents from the elite Israel Security Agency, known as Shin Bet.  Fellow diners, including Charlie Rose, billionaire Ronald Perelman, Barbara Winston,  DuJour’s Jason Binn and fashion icon Iris Apfel, watched as the agents swarmed the venue. “A security detail of 20 came an hour before Bibi arrived, then he turned up with around 20 more agents just after 9 p. m. in a restaurant that seats just over 100 people. Other agents were discreetly placed around the restaurant. They had a large security device in a black box,” said the spy. “Bibi sat with his wife for dinner, but then he went to the bathroom,” the source said. Guests are required to exit the restaurant through a side door into the   hotel, and the bathrooms are a few feet away downstairs. Read more here.
