 (CNN) Maisie Williams is the ultimate ”Game of Thrones” tease.  The first script from the HBO drama’s upcoming Season 7 was apparently so intense, the star couldn’t contain her emotions. And because this is 2016, she unleashed them all on Twitter.  ”Just finished reading season 7,” she wrote, ”   gets REAL.” In the course of five tweets, the actress went on to make the wait for the new season even more unbearable for fans of the show.  ”I’d start preparing yourselves now,” she continued. ”Scratch that, nothing will prepare you for this.” ”Game of Thrones” Season 7 is currently in production. The new season will be the show’s penultimate.  Last month, HBO confirmed its   series would conclude after Season 8.  The next season of the show is expected to debut in 2017 but will premiere later than usual.
