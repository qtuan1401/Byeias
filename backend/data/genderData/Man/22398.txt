Monica Kenyon noticed the man “fumbling with his date’s glass,” then saw “something fall from his hand into the glass below. ” Sonia Ulrich went into the bathroom, found the woman, and told her what they had observed. The woman reportedly expressed shock and said the male was “one of [her] best friends. ” The women told the story to restaurant management, which then reviewed security tapes and had the man arrested after seeing video confirmation of the accusation. “The Santa Monica Police Department later confirmed that the man had been arrested with multiple vials of a clear substance on him that has not yet been identified,” ABC 7 reported.
