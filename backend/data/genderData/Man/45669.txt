’’ ’The Cleveland Cavaliers lost their first game under new head coach ’ ’ following the meeting in which the players found out Blatt had been fired, the players got together for an ”extended and spirited” meeting that is being described as an ”airing of grievances. ”’ ’The meeting was reportedly called by veteran James Jones, at the encouragement of general manager David Griffin, and may have solved the biggest problems the Cavs faced under Blatt: accountability and the idea that different players played by different sets of rules.’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’One source echoed this sentiment.’ ’”It was like ripping off a scab,” one team source told ESPN. ”And it was exactly what needed to happen. I think it was what [Griffin] was hoping for. ”’ ”And it appears to be working. During the Cavs’   winning streak, they are averaging 115. 0 points per game, compared to 101. 0 points per game in the first 42 games of the season. The new offense has led to the more dominant performances expected of the Cavs, winning these four games by an average of 12. 8 points, 7. 6 points more than before the winning streak.” ’The Cavs have a long ways to go, but the combination of Lue and a team that is finally working together appears to have righted the ship.’
