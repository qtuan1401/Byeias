President Obama is boasting of his economic legacy to the New York Times, asserting that his management of the economy was likely the best in modern history. [“I actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform,” he said. “By that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history. ”  But the financial headlines this morning paint a different story: The U. S. economy grew only 0. 5 percent in the first quarter of 2016, the slowest pace in two years. Obama signaled discouragement that the media and the American people fail to appreciate what he has supposedly done to save the economy. “We were moving so fast early on that we couldn’t take victory laps. We couldn’t explain everything we were doing,” he told the Times. The president appeared irritated by the suggestion from R3epublicans that the economy was suffering under his administration. “I mean, the truth of the matter is that if we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we had taken to the swing voter, then we might have maintained a majority in the House or the Senate,” he insisted.
