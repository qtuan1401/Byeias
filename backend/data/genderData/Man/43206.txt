’  ’ ’   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP)  —   A federal jury has sentenced   Dylann Roof to death for killing nine black church members in a   racially motivated attack in 2015. ’ ’   Roof, who is white, faced either life in prison or execution for   the slayings on June 17, 2015. The Justice Department says he is   the first person to get the death penalty for federal hate   crimes. ’ ’   The jury reached a decision after about three hours of   deliberations. ’ ’   Roof was convicted last month of all 33 federal charges against   him. During sentencing, he represented himself and told jurors he   didn’t have a mental illness. But he didn’t offer any remorse or   ask that his life be spared. ’ ’   Roof told FBI agents he wanted to bring back segregation or   perhaps start a race war with the slayings. ’ ’’ ’   He threw away one last chance to plead for his life in front of   the jurors who convicted him of killing the churchgoers,   telling them Tuesday: ”I still feel like I had to do it.” ’ ’     ’
