’’ ”Sears has lost two top executives within the last week, sending a dire warning about the health of America’s   retailer just days ahead of its quarterly earnings report.” ’Jeffrey Balagna, formerly Sears’’ executive vice president, left the company Wednesday, ”in order to focus on his other business interests and pursue other career opportunities,” Sears said in an SEC filing dated November 23.’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’”highly unusual,” being in the middle of the critical holiday season and several days before earnings.’ ’Cohen,  said said the exits could be indicative of something ”catastrophic” in the company’’s financial performance.’ ’However, ’ ’”They have had this revolving door for years,”his is likely a continuation of that turnover. Given all the issues at Sears that are fairly substantial, I wouldn’’t necessarily view this as anything more significant. ”’ ”That’s not to say Wall Street is expecting anything but bad news from Sears this week, however, he said.” ’”I don’t think there is anyone who would be surprised if Sears reported terrible numbers on Thursday,” Emma said.’ ’If you work at Sears or Kmart and have a story to share, reach out to this reporter at hpeterson@businessinsider. com.’
