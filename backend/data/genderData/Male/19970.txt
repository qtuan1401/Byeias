LAREDO, Texas  —   Two Los Zetas cartel smugglers and seven illegal aliens were caught by Breitbart Texas crossing the shallow Rio Grande. The smugglers and their human cargo had set foot on U. S. soil in an unsecured portion of the border between Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico —  the headquarters of the brutal Mexican cartel, Los Zetas. The smugglers were shocked as this reporter ran upon them using an infrared video camera. The interrupted smugglers decided to return to Mexico. [The illegal aliens the two smugglers were bringing across likely paid $10, 000, collectively, to be taken into the U. S. across the river.
