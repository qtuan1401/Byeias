’  ’ ’   Someone who says they are an Apple employee posted this   picture of what looks like an Apple headquarters parking lot    on Thursday. ’ ’   That sure is a lot of Tesla cars.  ’ ’   In the photo, you can see a Tesla Roadster, the first car the   company released, several Tesla Model S vehicles, and even a few   Tesla Model X SUVs, which only came out earlier this year.  ’ ’   Most of Apple’’s offices around Silicon Valley are equipped with   car chargers, and it’’s not entirely surprising that Apple   employees would prefer Tesla cars, considering the electric car   company has drawn a fair share of inspiration from Apple.   As one person in the thread says, people call Teslas the   ”Palo Alto Camry.”  ’ ’   And perhaps Apple is drawing inspiration from Tesla as it works   on .  ’
