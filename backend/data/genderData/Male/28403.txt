A   panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit has placed a hold on U. S. District Judge Richard Leon’s May 17   ruling. [Breitbart News previously reported Leon ruled that DC’s “good reason” requirement for concealed permit applications is “likely” unconstitutional and violates the ruling in District of Columbia v Heller (2008). Leon stressed that the right to keep and bear arms is not simply limited to the home, but also includes public places.  He wrote: “Because the right to bear arms includes the right to carry firearms for   both inside and outside the home, I find that the District’s ‘good reason’ requirement likely places an unconstitutional burden on this right. ” A panel for DC Circuit has now put Leon’s ruling on hold, pending their review of his decision. According to The Washington Post, “Leon’s ruling is directly at odds with another judge’s decision on the same court in a similar case that is also pending in the D. C. Circuit. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
