 (CNN) The show went on for Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer after guitarist Michael Clifford was burned in a Saturday concert. The band played its third show Sunday night at London’s Wembley Arena    this time, without the pyrotechnic effects that injured the    musician the night before. ”Michael is recovering well after being given the all clear by doctors,” band spokeswoman Erin Cooney said. ”Michael and the band would like to thank all the fans,   and particularly last night’s audience for their support. There will be no pyrotechnic production for the show this evening.” Earlier Sunday, Clifford said on the band’s Facebook page that he was excited for Sunday’s show and feeling ”loads better” after Saturday’s mishap. Fans cheered the news, which came hours after he shared an image of himself on social media with half of his face wrapped in bandages. The mishap occurred on the band’s second night at Wembley Arena for its ”Rock Out With Your Socks Out” world tour.

Band mates Calum Hood and Luke Hemmings assured fans via social media that their    bandmate was in ”good spirits.” ”No one ever wants to see your best friend in the state I saw Mike backstage,” Hood said. ”He’s a trooper and is OK.”
