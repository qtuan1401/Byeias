’  ’ ”   Amazon’s   speaker Echo, along with the Alexa   software that powers the device, have turned into a surprise hit   for the company. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   The idea is to dream about what this product could be. ’ ’   The next step is to hash out the idea between a team of experts   that would potentially work on the new product.  ’ ’   ”There’’s a team in there, in a room, debating, from vice   presidents to junior software developers,” he says. ’ ’   Everyone is not only encouraged to speak their mind, they   are obligated to, he says. That’’s because Amazon has a motto   for its engineers: ”have backbone.” It means that Amazon wants   all the people working on a new product to be   onboard with the idea. ’ ’   ”The people in the room are bound to speak up if they think it’’s   wrong,” he says, because once they agree to be on the team,   that’’s the same as giving their approval.  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”And after that, if we think we have something, we do it,” he   says. ’ ”   The tactic doesn’t always mean the product will be a hit. The   Fire phone is probably the classic example, a product that was   killed after about a year. George wouldn’t comment on that. ” ”   But he did say that Amazon doesn’t tend to give up easily, even   when faced with initial failure. He offered Amazon Marketplace as   an example. ” ’   ”We thought we would compete with eBay,” he said and so the   company ”spent a lot of money” to build an auction site in   conjunction with ” ” which were like ecommerce booths where   merchants could sell stuff. The auction site didn’’t do well.   Amazon later discovered that people wanted to buy     stuff in conjunction with buying books and retail   items, he said. ’ ’   ”We had a lot of failure before we launched Marketplace and   today it’’s responsible for 50% of our sales. We were willing to   take a   view,” he said. ’
