The New York Times reports: GENEVA • Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants have summarily killed scores of civilians in the Iraqi city of Mosul in recent days, sometimes using children as executioners, and have used chemical agents against Iraqi and Kurdish troops, according to United Nations officials. [Video footage posted by the militants on Wednesday showed four children, who appear to be from 10 to 14 years old, shooting four civilians accused of disloyalty at a location near the Tigris River, said Ms Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesman for the UN human rights office in Geneva.  The video release identified one of the children as Russian, another as coming from Uzbekistan and two as Iraqis. UN investigators have not identified the time of the killings but believe they were recent, citing the surge in executions by ISIS courts and fighters in and around Mosul in recent weeks and the brutal training the militants have forced on children in the parts of Iraq and Syria they control. “They are showing they are still in business,” Ms Shamdasani said.
