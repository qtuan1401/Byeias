From Mal Siret writing at the Independent:  Hillary Clinton could lose the race for Democratic nominee as the focus shifts to California, where an influx of voter registrations threatens to derail her lead over Bernie Sanders. Mr Sanders will be looking to the state to boost his campaign with news of a further 1. 5 million people registering to vote since January this year. The latest statistics from the Institute of California will be encouraging to Mr Sanders as a big win in the 7 June California primary, where the candidates are currently virtually deadlocked, could hand him hundreds more delegates. Mr Sanders currently has 1, 501 pledged delegates to Ms Clinton’s 1, 769. The influx of additional registrants  —   a 218 per cent increase compared with the same period in 2012  —   is likely to include large numbers of young voters and could make this scenario a reality.
