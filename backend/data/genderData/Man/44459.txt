Specifically, he said the downturned wingtips   reminded him of something out of ”Star Trek” and the vertical or   near vertical fins on the plane would light up a radar. ’ ’   The scientist said he seriously doubted that Iran had the   engineering processes and expertise in place to manufacture a   stealth aircraft, the details of which need to be perfectly lined   up to baffle radars. Iran has for years been under sanctions,   prohibited from buying the kinds of components needed to build   advanced stealth aircraft. ’ ”   Writing for Vice’s Motherboard, journalist  the    —   which does not fly   in the video  —   had its tire pressure stenciled on the outside of   the plane and that it was way too low for a   airplane   weighed down with instruments and fuel. ” ’   The scientist says the tire pressure ”takes away all doubt that   it’’s a fake.” ’ ’   Still, some experts say Iran could attain somewhat credible   stealth aircraft in the near future, as  nears   production. ’ ’ ’ ’Iran recently released footage of what it. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
