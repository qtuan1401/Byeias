Campus Reform took to the University of Virginia dressed as “The Hipsters Who Stole Christmas” to see if students would sign their petition to ban Christmas.  Reporters Amber Athey and Cabot Phillips, claiming to be members of the fake group “Students for an Inclusive Holiday Season,” interviewed students at UVA to see if they felt “oppressed” and “triggered” by Christmas. After being told the celebration of Christmas can be “almost oppressive” for some students on campus, one female student enthusiastically said that she would “totally sign. ” In less than two hours, almost 20 students signed the fake   petition.
