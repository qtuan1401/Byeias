Sunday on CNN’s “Inside Politics,” White House correspondent for The New York Times Peter Baker explained that Democrats are concerned about the investigation into Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton’s email server that she used while Secretary of State.  Baker said, “Her problem at this point is not the Republicans. her problem is the FBI and the Obama Justice Department and what Democrats are quietly absolutely petrified about is that come summer, you know, you find an indictment of people around her, of her, a request for a special prosecutor, something that just basically turns this into a complete disaster for the Democrats in which it’s too late to change horses. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
