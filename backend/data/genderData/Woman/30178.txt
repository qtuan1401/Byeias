Nevada’s Democratic Latino voters are divided over support for Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) with the older population backing the former secretary of state and the younger,   demographic supporting Sanders. [“The leadership that is older is all Clinton, but the younger Latinos, they’re with Sanders,” Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, whose organization has been working in Nevada ahead of the state’s Democratic caucus on Saturday, told the Los Angeles Times. “My daughters are Sanders people. My wife is with Hillary. ”  A new   Poll, conducted ahead of Saturday’s caucuses, shows an almost even split between likely Democratic caucusgoers in Nevada in their support for Clinton (48%) and Sanders. Sanders has made tremendous strides since he announced his candidacy last year particularly among millennials, while Clinton has the majority backing of women and voters over the age of 55.
