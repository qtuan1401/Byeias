Brock Lesnar wore a Canadian kit into the octagon at UFC 200. But he delivered an   message shortly before leaving it in triumph. [“One thing I do want to do: America, a shout out to the men in uniform who protect and serve this country, from sea to shining sea,” Lesnar told the Las Vegas audience in his postfight interview with Joe Rogan. “From one white boy to all nationalities: We need to stand together, people. ”  The remarks, with Tom Brady, Justin Timberlake, and Conor McGregor looking on, come in the aftermath of a sniper murdering five   officers in Dallas on Thursday and other firearms assaults on police in Georgia, Tennessee, and points beyond this week. The violence follows police shooting and killing black men in Minnesota and Louisiana, which unleashed protests, peaceful and otherwise. Lesnar dominated Mark Hunt in the first and third round to win a unanimous   decision over the Super Samoan at UFC 200. He entered the octagon the underdog. He left it looking like his old (young) dominant self. Before he returns to the cage, if he returns to the cage, Lesnar returns to the WWE. Vince McMahon’s Lesnar loan to the UFC did not come without recompense. The UFC   view aired ads for WWE’s Summer Slam headlined by Lesnar and Randy Orton and a forthcoming video game that utilized Lesnar’s “suplex city” catchphrase. Lesnar subsequently delivered his   announcement inside the octagon. The son of Webster, South Dakota, owns a ranch in Canada on which he hunts, which explains the red maple leaf on his trunks. But his patriotic plea reminded the international crowd of his American origins.
