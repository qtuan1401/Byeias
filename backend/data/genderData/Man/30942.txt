Sen. Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is successfully blocking the appointment of a third board member at the unpopular   bank, according to a report from the Heritage Foundation’s Daily Signal site. [That block means the federal government’s   bank can’t do what it usually does  —   offer     to foreign customers of big Americans companies, such as Boeing. If those loans go   in the future, Boeing keeps its revenue and the taxpayers pay the cost.  Without a third   for the   board, the   bank can only provide   insurance for transactions worth up $10 million. That shifts   bank’s guarantees  —   and the taxpayers’ support  —   towards smaller U. S. companies. This populist stance has helped Shelby  —   he defeated his primary opponents in February, including Jonathan McConnell. But now big companies  —   AKA donors to the GOP establishment  —   want the   turned back on. The GOP’s Senate leader, Mitch McConnell is pressuring Shelby to approve the appointment of the third  . According to The Daily Signal, If Shelby holds strong, McConnell could move to bring the nominees directly to the Senate floor, bypassing the chairman and his committee. Though it would be difficult for the majority leader to make such a move without taking heat and sending a bad message to other committee chairman, the GOP Senate staffer said the majority leader could enlist the help of his Democratic colleagues to do so instead. However, the staffer warned that setting such a precedent could be dangerous for the majority leader, particularly as a number of nominations —  including that of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland —  are currently held up in   committees. McConnell’s increased pressure on the Banking Committee comes amid comments from Boeing’s chief executive officer at  ’s annual conference, taking place this week. Speaking to attendees Thursday, Dennis Muilenburg urged Shelby to move forward with nominees to  ’s board. Muilenburg warned that without financing from the government agency, airlines abroad may not be able to accept the delivery of planes from Boeing, which puts its international business at risk. The GOP’s conservatives briefly killed off the   bank in 2015, but it was revived in December by a   bipartisan coalition of establishment GOP and Democratic legislators.
