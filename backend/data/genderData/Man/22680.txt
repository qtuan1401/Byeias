Posters calling for Gawker Media founder Nick Denton to be jailed have sprung up around New York City.

Someone in New York, however, believe that Denton has yet to fully answer for his crimes. The following posters were spotted earlier today in New York, and are being spread on social media by a   Twitter account, “@jail_denton. ”       A full gallery of   photos of the posters at various locations in New York can be found on Flickr.
