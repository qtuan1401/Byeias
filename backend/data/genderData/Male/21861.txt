Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton declared her vote authorizing   George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq in 2002 her biggest political regret.  “I guess my greatest regret was voting to give President Bush the authority in Iraq,” Clinton said. “It did not turn out the way I thought it would based on what he had said. And I regret that. And I’ve said that it was a mistake and obviously it’s something that, you know, I wish hadn’t turned out the way it did. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
