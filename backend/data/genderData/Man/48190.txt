’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   Sport bras could be a better bet since they’re harder to   make,  ” ’   ”There’’s no reason Victoria’’s Secret shouldn’’t be a major player   in sports bras,” she said. ’ ’   The athleisure market is certainly saturated, but   the company has made moves to compete with brands like Nike   and Lululemon by launching Victoria Sport, which, as Santaniello   noted, is markedly cheaper than its competitors. ’ ’  ’ ”   Victoria’s Secret’s bigger issue is it’s image.  ” ’   Santaniello said that the brand is ”suffering from an image   problem because they for so long held on to that fantasy image.” ’ ’   T ’ ’  ’ ’   That said, Victoria’’s Secret still dominates the lingerie   market, and its total annual sales  —   nearly $7. 7 billion last   year  —   are massive compared to its competitors. At the end of the   day, Santaniello said, what matters most is the   brand’’s ”core competencies”  —   and one of those is just   a really good bra. ’ ’  ’
