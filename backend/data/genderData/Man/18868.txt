On Tuesday Democrats in the House and Senate put forward legislation to bar individuals 16 years and younger from shooting  . [The bill also bars individuals 16 years and under from shooting a machine gun, and this would include “blocking [persons under 16] from firing the guns at a gun show or a gun range” even if their parents are present.  According to The Hill, the ban was put forth by Senator Ed Markey ( .) and Representative Ruben Gallego (  ). Markey released a statement with the ban, saying, “The small hands of children and big power of machine guns are a deadly combination. Assault weapons are weapons of war and should not be allowed in the hands of children. ” The ban is being pushed beside a Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence petition which is also aimed at placing “age restrictions” on shooting   and related firearms. The Brady Campaign said, “We’re now calling upon kids across the nation and their parents support this brave bill by signing our petition. Kids and assault weapons don’t mix. ” The bill is expected to go nowhere. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
