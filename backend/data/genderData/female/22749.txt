Tej Gill, a former Warfare Operator of the United States Naval Special Warfare Group who served as a Navy SEAL for 10 years with SEAL Team 5, spoke exclusively with Breitbart News about his organization Project War Path and its latest campaign, “Hillary Clinton Killed My Friends. ”[“We started Project War Path to tell the story of how Navy SEALs got to war,” Gill said, adding, “now, we want to get the story out about Hillary Clinton. ”  “Project War Path is making   that say ‘Hillary Clinton Killed My Friends,’” the decorated former Petty Officer Second Class said. “The reason I’m adamant about doing this is because Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were my friends,” Gill said of former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty, and former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods who were both killed while working for the CIA’s Global Response staff on Sept. 11, 2012 when Islamic militants attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, killing U. S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U. S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith.  “I’ve known Tyrone Woods since 1997,” Gill said. “He was a mentor of mine when I was a new guy in the SEAL teams. ” “Glen Doherty, I met him around   2004, and was friends with him ever since. I was actually roommates with him in Afghanistan in 2011. ” “So,” Gill continues, Hillary Clinton “really did kill my friends when she was secretary of state, by denying security upgrades at the consulate that probably would have stopped the terror attack. ”  Hot off the press! #projectwarpath #neverhillary #instagram #seals #nsw #usa  #veterans #frogman #5326 #navyseal #lltb #army #navy #airforce #marines #firstresponders #military #warriors #america, A photo posted by Project War Path (@projectwarpath) on Jun 15, 2016 at 1:06pm PDT,  You can follow Project War Path on Instagram here.
