’  ’ ’   Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman arrived at his usual   Wednesday media session in full Harry Potter regalia, Gryffindor   robes, wand, and circle glasses included.  ’ ’   As Sherman explained to reporters after walking across the   room while his phone played the Harry Potter film franchise   theme music, his son asked him to dress up for Halloween, so he   did.  ’ ’   He added that playing five quarters of football  —   which the   Seahawks did on Sunday night in a wonky   tie against the   Cardinals  —   was about as hard as a game, er, match of   Quidditch.  ’ ’   ”Quidditch, you know, the beaters, the chasers, trying to find   the golden snitch . .. that’’s tough,” Sherman said. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tRichard Sherman goes full Harry Potter in   press conference.    ’ ”   Sherman’s Harry Potter fandom has been   over   the years.  revealed that he   devoured all the books, and, as a student at Stanford, attended   the midnight releases of the movies when they came out (though   never in costume).  ” ’   The Seattle media missed its opportunity to ask Sherman his   thoughts on ”Harry Potter and the Cursed   Child,” though as I’’m sure we can all agree,   Sherman presumably didn’’t like it as much as the   originals.  ’
