’  ’ ”   If ’ buyout   of  goes through as planned,   it’ll create a new paradigm for the U. S. residential solar   market. ” ’   SolarCity would be further integrated with energy storage and   electric vehicles, and with its own solar panel manufacturing   plant on the way sometime in the next two years, it could make   almost everything it needs  . ’ ”   There are sure to be winners and losers after such an alliance,   and below I’ve outlined a few of the companies that should hate   to see SolarCity acquired by Tesla Motors. ” ’   If Tesla is really going to get serious about energy and energy   storage, it will likely start integrating components to cut costs   and improve performance. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk clearly wants to   make batteries a standard component of a solar power system. ’ ”   If that’s the case, I would worry about  a company that makes power optimizers and   inverters that SolarCity uses today. SolarCity is its biggest   customer, accounting for 24. 6% of revenue in fiscal 2015.   ” ”   A merger between SolarCity and Tesla Motors would bring more   component development   as SolarCity works to incorporate   more Powerwalls and completes its own panel manufacturing plant.   I can’t see why the combined company wouldn’t want to squeeze out   as many components as possible or move them   putting a   lot of pressure on SolarEdge. ” ’  ’ ”   Central to Elon Musk’s idea that Tesla Energy can make solar cool   is SolarCity’s Buffalo, New York, panel manufacturing plant. The   facility is expected to make   solar panels than   SolarCity currently installs, creating direct competition with   some of its suppliers. ” ” and  are two of the companies that could lose the   most as SolarCity transitions to its own solar panels. They’re   both big suppliers to SolarCity and sell a significant portion of   their wares to the U. S. market. ” ”     manufacturers need as many sources of demand as   possible, and taking SolarCity or Tesla Energy out of the mix   would be bad for them as a whole. We know that SolarCity’s   production plant is coming, but with it under Tesla Motors’   umbrella, Elon Musk would, I think,  double down on   solar panels and squeeze suppliers even further out of the   market. ” ’  ’ ”   SolarCity is the dominant player in residential solar, so when it   makes changes, the entire industry feels it. Coming under Tesla   Motors’ ownership would move the company to a more vertically   integrated model, in which it would be designing and building   more of its components to both lower costs and simplify system   design. ” ”   Of course, the merger might not go through as planned, and   SolarCity might remain independent, with its current strategy   intact. At the end of the day, shareholders will have their say   in this deal, and given the market’s current reaction, they don’t   seem to like the idea of the two companies becoming one. ”
