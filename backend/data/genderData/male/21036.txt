Despite the praise for and calls to violence, none of these users were sanctioned by Twitter: Twitter’s terms of service explicitly forbids “threats of violence” and any tweets that “promote violence, including threatening or promoting terrorism. ” The company also bans using the platform for the “furtherance of illegal activities. ” Yet, so far, the platform has taken no action against accounts promoting violence against the police, which includes a verified user with more than four hundred thousand followers. In addition, rapper Talib Kweli has not faced any consequences for using Twitter to call Breitbart’s Jerome Hudson a “coon. ” He defended his remarks by claiming that “calling a coon a coon ain’t an attack. ” Although Yiannopoulos has been permanently banned, ISIS members and sympathizers still comfortably hold accounts on the social media platform. Most notably, a member of the radical terrorist group threatened to bomb the warehouse that stores merchandise sold by Swag by Milo, Yiannopoulos’ popular online apparel store.
