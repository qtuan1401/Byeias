Sen. Marco Rubio is raising questions about whether Sen. Ted Cruz holds his campaign staffers accountable for sharing inaccurate political stories about his rivals. [“This is a pattern now and I think we’re at a point where we now start asking for accountability,” Marco Rubio told reporters in Las Vegas, according to Bloomberg News. A senior Cruz staffer apologized for spreading a false story this weekend about Marco Rubio making fun of the Bible.  If this was the way that Cruz ran his campaign, Rubio suggested, he would probably run his White House in a similar fashion if elected president. “Who’s going to be fired when Ted Cruz is president?” Rubio wondered. “Because this campaign now has repeatedly done things that they have to apologize for, and who has been held accountable?” Rubio echoed the same sentiment that Ben Carson shared when a Cruz staffer was caught spreading information about Carson quitting his campaign as the Iowa caucuses were underway. Carson made similar observations about Cruz’s campaign in February during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. Tapper asked Carson if he wanted someone fired in the campaign as a result of their actions. “I think whoever is responsible for blatant lying should be dismissed, absolutely. Unless that kind of behavior is acceptable in your campaign culture,” Carson replied.
