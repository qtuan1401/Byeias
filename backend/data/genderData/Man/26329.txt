Speaker Paul Ryan’s primary challenger Paul Nehlen discussed his latest ad hitting Ryan for his   “drug problem” today with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon. [Said Nehlen of Ryan, “His failure to secure this border has created a new underground railroad for transporting, not only illegal aliens into this country but illegal narcotics, as well.   …     We’re losing more American lives to ‘narco terror’ in Chicago and Milwaukee today, than Islamic terror in Afghanistan and Iraq. ” Nehlen says he’s not minimizing the threat from Islamic Terrorism but “dead is dead, whether it’s a bullet from ISIS, or Mexican Heroin. ”  Added Nehlen, “DC politicians are the first ones to keep soda and salt away from our kids, when you try to keep a child from dying from a $5 Heroin pill, they’re noticeably silent. ” The ad is below: Breitbart News Daily airs from 6 a. m. to 9 a. m. Eastern weekdays on SiriusXM Patriot 125.
