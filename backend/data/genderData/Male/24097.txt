Saturday during Fox News Channel’s special coverage of the South Carolina Republican Primary, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) took aim at Breitbart News after he was asked about a report on Breitbart’s website that questioned his willingness to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials while crafting the   Gang of Eight immigration reform legislation.  The report cited ICE Council president Chris Crane, who is also an active duty ICE officer, who Rubio dismissed as well as Breitbart News. “Number one, that’s not true,” Rubio said. “And he’s not an ICE official. He’s the head of a union and it’s being reported on a website that’s not a credible source. It’s the same website that said, Neil, that you guys gave me the questions to the debate. ” He went on to describe Breitbart as a site that reports “conspiracy theories. ” “We don’t even credential them for our events,” he added. “This is the same website that reported that Fox News and that you and your guys in the debate gave me the questions so that I could prepare. You know that that’s not true. So I literally don’t even talk about the things they report because they’re basically conspiracy theories and oftentimes manipulated. And that individual ICE official. He’s the head of a union. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
