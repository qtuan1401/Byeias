Despite the figures most commonly associated with the terror organisation being male, thousands of women are the ‘glue holding the organisation together’ researchers at the University of Miami have found. The study ‘Women’s Connectivity in Extreme Networks’ has been published in the journal Science Advances and involved researchers analysing data from 40, 000 suspected terrorists.
