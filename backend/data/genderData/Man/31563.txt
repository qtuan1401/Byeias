On Friday presumptive Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton responded to the Dallas Police ambush by pushing reforms for police departments and more gun control. [The reforms are intended to prevent   shootings like the ones that took place in Falcon Heights, Minnesota (Philando Castile) and Baton Rouge (Alton Sterling). It is important to note that both of those shootings are under investigation and officers have yet to be found at fault.  But Clinton said, “We do need police and criminal justice reforms to save lives and makes sure all Americans are treated equally in rights and dignity. ” According to Roll Call, Clinton also called for more gun control. She said “actions” are needed “to address gun violence. ” Breitbart News previously reported that President Obama also used the Dallas Police ambush to call for more gun control. On Friday, the day after the ambush occurred, he said he was “horrified” by the attack and then signaled that a gun control push would be forthcoming. On Saturday Obama criticized Texas open carry laws and tied police officer safety to the passage of more gun control. The Black Congressional Caucus (CBC) also used the Dallas Police ambush to push for more gun control —  including a ban on   and “high capacity” magazines. Moreover, like Clinton, the CBC continued to criticize police for   shootings of young black men.
