Congressman Darrell Issa ( ) chairman of the House Oversight Committee, talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon about President Barack Obama’s willful disregard for the law as president and the FBI’s decision not to charge Hillary Clinton for her actions involving top secret emails. [Issa said:  We are in a crisis because Hillary Clinton, if the voters do not stop her, will be the next President of the United States. She will, in fact, on Day One say, “Pardon me,” and she’ll mean it. She’ll have pardoned herself. She will have, in fact, gone from being a criminal involved in a criminal enterprise  —   obviously, Clinton Cash depicted that  —   and somebody who flaunted the security laws, the privacy laws, the presidential and the Federal Records Act, and gotten away with it.
