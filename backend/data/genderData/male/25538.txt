Monday on ABC’s “The View,” actress and   Candace Cameron Bure defended Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) against her   Michelle Collins, who said it would be “satisfying”  if the “National Enquirer” story claiming Ted Cruz has had multiple affairs during his marriage to wife Heidi Cruz was true because Collins said it would prove Cruz’s claims of living by a “crazy moral code,” are hypocritical.    Candace Cameron Bure instantly objected to Collins portrayal of “Christian values,” as a “crazy moral code. ” Collins backed down saying, “You know, you have a point actually,  Let’s just call it a moral code. ” She added, “the point is if he is a cheater it would be quite satisfying,” Cameron Bure continued, “Girlfriend, I love you but I am so disagreeing with you on this. I can’t find the humor in that. I can’t   …     I don’t find satisfaction in seeing anyone be ruined. I really don’t. I want to believe the best in people. I want to hope the best in people. We know that not all people are good and we don’t make good decisions all of the time, but I always want to hope and root for people. ” Collins said, “Candace is a better person than me   …     you really are. Listen, with someone like Ted Cruz I would like to see him fall personally. He is not a good guy. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
