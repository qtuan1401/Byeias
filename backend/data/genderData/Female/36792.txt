 (CNN) A   man shouting ”Allahu Akbar” was shot and killed after wounding two police officers Saturday in the Belgian city of Charleroi, police said via Twitter.  The assault occurred outside a police station in the center of Charleroi, which is about 30 miles south of Brussels.  The armed man penetrated a secure zone and wounded the officers, who suffered deep cuts around their faces, according to Radio Télévision Belge Francophone (RTBF). One officer was transported to a hospital, the other was less seriously wounded. The attacker was shot by a third officer on the scene and died later at a hospital, according to RTBF.  Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, on Twitter, said he was closely monitoring the situation: ”I condemn strongly the attack in Charleroi. My thoughts are with the victims, their relatives and police officers.” A security perimeter was set up around boulevard Pierre Mayence. The Belgian capital has been on high alert after terror attacks killed 31 people in March. Two bombs exploded at the Brussels Airport, and a third went off at a metro station. ISIS claimed responsibility for the bombings, which also wounded 300 people.
