In an appearance on NBC’s “Today” on Wednesday, Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton discussed her opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) another candidate from her party’s presidential nomination.  In recent weeks, Sanders has gained ground on Clinton and in some cases has passed her in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Despite that, Clinton maintained she wasn’t “nervous,” a word Sanders used to suggest the state of Clinton’s campaign in an earlier interview. “No, I’m not nervous at all,” Clinton said. “I’m working hard and I intend to keep working as hard as I can until the last vote or   expresses an opinion. I’m excited about where we are. ” Later in the segment, Clinton was asked about what distinguishes her from Sanders, to which Clinton pointed to Sanders on the gun issues. “One of the big ones, as you’re aware, is on gun safety, where Senator Sanders has been a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby, and I have been standing against them for a long time, voting against them as a senator. These are kinds of differences people deserve to know about as they make up their minds. ” When asked about the latest round of attacks from her campaign aimed at Sanders, Clinton said she “had a very different sense of the rhythm of the campaign” and decided that now was the time to set herself apart from Sanders.
