’ We could be headed for a spike in volatility, according to UBS.’ ’For the majority of the last 100+ trading days, the CBOE Volatility Index () has hovered around 11, a very low level.’ ’UBS sees a perfect storm of factors converging that will end this unusually long period of subdued volatility, according to a note circulated to clients.’ ”UBS  that the Federal Reserve’s likely rate hike on March 15 and expected weak economic data in the first quarter of 2017 will drive the market down at least 10%. ” ’The bank said: ’ ’UBS is also wary of falling oil prices and softening credit conditions, a similar scenario to market turbulence in the early months of 2016’ ’’ ’One of the indicators that has UBS on alert is the growth of the ”VIX premium,” or the  between the volatility index and realized S&P 500 volatility. The VIX is around 11 while actual recent moves in the S&P 500 represent a volatility less than 7%. UBS noted that these periods of elevated VIX premiums usually don’’t last long.’ ’’ ’UBS argues that one of the reasons that this risk premium has developed is a lack of correlation between stocks in the S&P 500. When this occurs in a bull market, valuations tend to become stretched, and the US equity market is currently trading above 20x earnings on a trailing 12 month basis.’
