A Georgia police officer has bonded with a baby after saving her life. [On Saturday September 24, officer Kenneth Knox was dispatched to the Parham residence, where he found a    baby choking and not breathing.  “I had fed her an hour prior to her choking,” mother Kristen Parham told FOX 5 Atlanta. “We were sitting outside, in my car, and all of a sudden she started gasping for air and white stuff was coming out of her nose and mouth. ” Parham said the baby’s father jumped off the porch and attempted to save his daughter. “We both didn’t know what to do, so I called 911,” Parham said. According to her parents, Ma’Yavi was turning blue before Officer Knox arrived on the scene. “He laid her on the couch and he did [reverse] CPR on her, and he sucked the cereal out of her throat,” Parham said. The baby started breathing again, smiled at the officer, and started crying, which Knox described as “music to his ears” in a post on Facebook: “Out of my 25 years being a cop, this is my greatest and most profound accomplishment,” he said. “It made every second of those 25 years worth it all. I am forever humbled and changed by this. ” Parham asked Knox to be Ma’Yavi’s godfather a week later, and Knox responded “yes. ” “I know he is a great person and my baby will love him,” Parham told FOX 5 Atlanta. “Every time she sees him, she gives him a big smile. ” Knox was honored to take on the role, calling Ma’Yavi his “angel” in a Facebook post.  “I can’t put it into words,” Knox told FOX 5 Atlanta. “She changed me forever. ”
