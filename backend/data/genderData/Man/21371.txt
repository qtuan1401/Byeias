Brown went through concussion protocol all week following the shot to the head and has been ruled out for Sunday’s playoff game at Denver. “A. B. my apology, my brother. I’m a man of my word and I’ve been doing a little traveling which is what took me so long   …     I apologize, sincerely man. Get well,” Jones said, The apology comes after Jones told Dan Patrick on his radio show, “I know he was faking. Go back and look at the play. You go back and slow motion the play and you tell me Vontaze hit him in the head or did his shoulder pads barely touch him?” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
