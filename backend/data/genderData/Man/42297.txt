 (CNN) It appears that Hillary Clinton is riding the streaming music wave. Her campaign released her official 2016 Spotify playlist Saturday morning ahead of her first major rally in New York    and they’re lively tunes containing themes of positivity and resiliency. None of the 14 songs on the    candidate’s playlist was released before 1999, and the list includes popular female artists such as Sara Bareilles, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry and Ariana Grande. One song in particular, Kelly Clarkson’s ”Stronger,” has lyrics that seemed particularly poignant for the political veteran. ”You think you got the best of me, Think you’ve had the last laugh, Bet you think that everything good is gone, Think you left me broken down, Think that I’d come running back, Baby you don’t know me, cause you’re dead wrong” Unlike in the past, however, this campaign moment did not feature ”Captain Jack” by Billy Joel, which might have made the playlist a bit more interesting.
