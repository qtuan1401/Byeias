GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is pushing back against President Obama’s proposed executive actions.  One, an amnesty rule, would provide more foreign worker permits for white collar jobs. Huckabee says this “  is classic dictator. ” “The Administration has also announced their intention to advance new gun control executive orders in early January of next year,” notes Huckabee’s press release.  Huckabee stated: With Congress away on recess and the American people distracted by the holidays, Obama’s New Year’s amnesty   is classic dictator. This   immigration amnesty rule is an unconstitutional assault on America’s workers. Why are we robbing seniors and veterans of their   benefits to give handouts to illegal immigrants and foreign   workers? Why did we fight a revolution against the tyranny of one, unelected monarch so we could surrender our Constitution to this    president? Obama’s executive orders on gun control, planned for early next year, are also unconstitutional and completely insane. What’s worse though is this   Congress waves the white flag of surrender every time. It’s time we burn down the Washington political machine, reject Obama’s amnesty agenda and put Americans first.
