Kansas gunman Cedric Ford, who shot and killed three people and wounded 14 others Thursday, was a felon who was barred from possessing a firearm. [He faced 100 percent gun control, and the dead and the wounded now serve as another sad reminder that gun control does not stop or even hinder those with criminal determination.  Breitbart News reported that Ford began shooting at individuals as he drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, Kansas, around 5 p. m. He did the most damage when he finally reached the Excel building and ran inside, randomly shooting. As news of the shooting poured forth, KWCH identified the gunman as    Cedric Ford and reported that his “Facebook page says he was a painter at Excel. ” According to NBC News, Ford allegedly shot people in the town of Newton, as well. He was armed with an “assault rifle” and a pistol, but authorities do not believe he ever fired the pistol. Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton speculated that Ford may have been set off around 3:30 p. m. that same day, when a Harvey County deputy issued him a protective order. Walton did not say who had requested the order. NBC News reports that Ford “was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida including burglary in 2000. ” However, the gun ban that comes with a felony conviction was impotent to stop Ford from killing three and wounding numerous others.
