Talk radio host Laura Ingraham argued Senator Marco Rubio ( ) had “a Rick Perry” moment during his dispute with ICE officer Chris Crane on Tuesday.  Ingraham said, “ICE officer to Marco Rubio, this is from Breitbart, ‘You lied to the American people on Fox News.’ Immigration Customs Enforcement President, Chris Crane, is issuing a challenge to Marco Rubio following Rubio’s attack on the officer. And, in an email to Rubio’s campaign, Crane challenges Rubio to meet so that the ICE officer can present Rubio with his badge and his credentials. Following Crane’s detailed account last week of how law enforcement was treated like absolute trash by Sen. Rubio during efforts to enact his   amnesty and mass immigration bill through the Senate, Rubio appeared on national television and denounced ICE officer Crane and his service to the nation. ‘He’s not an ICE official, he’s head of a union,’ he told Neil Cavuto. Rubio said he would not address Crane’s accusations because they were published in Breitbart News, suggesting Crane was a conspiracy theorist. Rubio’s comment, ‘I literally don’t talk about things they  report because they’re basically conspiracy theories and often times manipulated. And, the individual is not an ICE official, he’s head of a union.’ Chris Crane has served the nation as an ICE officer for 13 years, he’s also a former Marine  —   lifetime service to his country. Oops. That’s a Rick Perry moment. So, Marco Rubio said he literally doesn’t  —   first of all, Marco, learn what the word literally is properly used as, not as a pause in your sentence. ” Follow Breitbart.
