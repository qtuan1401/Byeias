 (CNN) It started as a dream night for fifty Girl Scouts, who got to be the first scouts in history to camp out on the South Lawn of the White House, But as night set and the clouds darkened, storms tore through Washington D. C. and the girls were forced to evacuate their camp site at around 1 a. m.   And if you’ve ever experienced a storm in the nation’s capitol, you would be familiar with how quickly they sneak up on you and how fierce they can be. The Girl Scouts ended up sleeping in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, according to a White House official.  But before the weather took a turn, the Girl Scouts sang campfires songs like ”Love Being a girl Scout” with the President and the First Lady, practiced pitching tents, tying knots, and got a   lesson from NASA astronaut Cady Coleman. The first lady hosted this event as part of the ”Let’s Move” campaign to fight childhood obesity and increase nutrition awareness. ”You are making history. This is something you can tell your kids and your grandkids,” the First Lady told the girls. ”Do you understand the impact, the importance, of this moment today? It’s exciting!” As the President got ready to leave for the night, he told the girls ”You guys are having so much fun, but unfortunately, I’ve got to go to work.” Some Girl Scouts were not pleased but Obama quickly added ”but we can have a group hug,” and all fifty scouts swarmed around him.
