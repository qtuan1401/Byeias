Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Your World,” Gov. Pat McCrory ( ) discussed the firebombing of the Republican Party headquarters in Orange Co. NC that occurred over the weekend.  McCrory told host Neil Cavuto it was an assault on the democratic system and added that it was act of intimidation. “I don’t think it’s going to happen between now and the election, but I do appreciate the mayor making those very positive comments. I think we have people who in both parties who take this stuff a little too seriously and they don’t realize the impact of their actions can be deadly. It can impact the democratic process and it’s a clear act of intimidation. And I’m going to do everything I can to find this individual or individuals who threw a  —   literally a firebomb into a window in Hillsborough, NC. It’s unacceptable and we’re going to make sure this doesn’t impact the free elections in this country and in the state of North Carolina. ” He went on to say he had not heard from the Obama White House and that it was “unacceptable. ” “This is much more than an act of vandalism,” McCrory said. “That’s one reason I called the SBI to make sure we have an SBI agent actively involved with local law enforcement in this investigation, but initially this wasn’t taken that seriously by some of the local authorities. But it is now. I appreciate the mayor’s comment, but I hope this White House treats this as seriously as they would if it happened to the other party. And I would as governor, I’m sure the president would, too. But this type of a Molotov cocktail being thrown into a window in probably the dead of night, I’m just glad no one got hurt. but it is a clear sign of intimidation and it’s unacceptable in our country and unacceptable here in North Carolina.
