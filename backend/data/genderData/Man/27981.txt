A    Wisconsin basketball player is recovering after a freak accident on the court left her impaled by a floorboard, according to a report by Fox 6 Now.  The girl was sliding on the court after bumping into an opponent and she slid on the court until she became stuck on the splintered floorboard. “I mean, there’s no rhyme or reason to this one,” said tournament organizer Perry Hibner. The official told the girl to get up, but she informed him she was unable to. “And the official said, ‘What do you mean? Are you hurt?’ And she’s like, ‘There’s a piece of wood stuck to me,” Hibner described. According to Hibner, the splinter was about three to four inches long. He does not expect any legal actions to be taken from the “complete fluke” incident. Hibner also said the injured girl is expected to be back in action in the near future.
