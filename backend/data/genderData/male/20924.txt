Thursday on WGN Radio, while discussing the latest WikiLeaks, which exposed former president Bill Clinton’s aggressive lobbing for large speaking fees from donors to the Clinton Foundation, NBC’s “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd said the Clinton Foundation needs to be shut down if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is elected president in November.  Todd said, “Look let me go to bottom line, there is no way, under any circumstance, the Clinton Foundation should be operating if she becomes president. I just don’t see how they can keep that going. I just don’t. ” He added, “She’s got an opportunity, again, if she doesn’t do half measures here, if they shut it down to at least make this  —   to at least limit the political damage. ” (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
