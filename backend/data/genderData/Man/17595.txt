His Spanish slogans existed separately from the rest of the speech and he did not always translate them into English for the rest of the crowd. Kaine urged all Americans to attend a immigration naturalization ceremony. “When you go to services, and you see these people’s desire to join this great country, you’ll basically have this pretty amazing thought,” he said. “Anybody who loves America this much deserves to be here, deserves to be here. ”
