Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said Saturday that “We should not allow a judge to be appointed” by President Obama. [At the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina, Carson spoke of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Carson said that he was unhappy to see negative comments being made about Scalia.  “We need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country,” Carson said. “I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks. ” “We should be thinking about how can we create some healing in this land,” Carson said. “But right now, we’re not gonna get healing with President Obama. That’s very clear, so I fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time. ” Carson released a statement after the news was announced that Scalia had passed away. In the statement, Carson urged the U. S. Senate not to allow President Obama to appoint a Supreme Court nominee. “Given the dire condition our democracy currently finds itself under Obama’s ideological agenda, I call on the Senate to stop any attempts to fill this crucial seat until We The People elect a strong Constitutionalist this November,” Carson said.
