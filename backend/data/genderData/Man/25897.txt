The saga of Johnny Manziel turns another chapter on Monday when a Dallas County grand jury hands down an indictment against the former Cleveland Browns quarterback for an alleged assault on his   Colleen Crowley, in January. [The 2012 Heisman trophy winner faces a charge of misdemeanor assault, which carries a maximum punishment of one year in jail and a $4, 000 fine.  On Thursday a grand jury charged Manziel, but in Dallas County indictments are official after two working days, the Dallas Morning News reported.  Crowley maintains that on the night of Jan. 29 at the Hotel ZaZa in Uptown Dallas, Manziel beat her so bad that he burst her eardrum. After the incident Crowley secured a protective order preventing Manziel from seeing her for two years and mandating that the former Aggies icon stay at least 500 feet away from her home and place of work, reports WFAA News 8. Manziel’s string of bad news continues. Last week Drew Rosenhaus became the second sports agent this year to terminate a contract with the    Texan.  In February, agent Erik Burkhardt parted ways with Manziel shortly after the domestic assault allegation. Clearly, Burkhardt had had enough with Manziel after his repeated episodes of bad behavior, which included missed team meetings and alleged alcohol abuse. Earlier in April, Manziel’s landlord alleged that he and friends trashed the premises of her $4 million house to the tune of $32, 000 in damages. Moreover, Fox News reported that at the recent Coachella Rock festival, the NFL outcast “arrived wasted, partied wasted and stayed wasted. ” The Browns released Manziel after just two seasons last month. The indictment, atop numerous   issues, make Manziel surfacing with another NFL team anytime soon unlikely.
