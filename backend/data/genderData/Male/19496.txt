Sunday, on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said he is still fighting to beat Democratic   Hillary Clinton for the nomination.  Sanders said, “Right now we have about 45% of the pledged delegates. There are ten states and some other contests coming up. We think we’re strong in many of those states, including California, our largest state. We think we have a chance to win the majority of pledged delegates. It’s an uphill fight, I admit it. We need to win 65% of those votes. The states that are coming up are favorable to us. ” He added, “It’s difficult. It’s not impossible. We will need 65% of the remaining ten contests, plus DC, plus Puerto Rico, et cetera, to do it. Now, 65% is a pretty heavy climb. But, these are states, by the way, that I think we’re going to do very very well in. California is out there. California happens to be perhaps most progressive state in this country. They have the most delegates. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
