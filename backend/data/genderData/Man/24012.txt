Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough speculated on the implications of Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) defeating party   Hillary Clinton in next week’s California Democratic presidential primary.  According to Scarborough, such an upset by Sanders would be a “political earthquake. ” “California should be an easy win for Hillary,” Scarborough said. “The NBC poll yesterday, the field poll today, suggests this is a tight race. It’s going down to the very end. It’s going to be extraordinarily important if not in the delegate count in the public relations game. A Bernie Sanders win in California is a political earthquake. It’s that simple. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
