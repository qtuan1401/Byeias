New York (CNN) Anwar Sanders is a police officer in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He’s also a young black man. And, Sanders says, after a week where the world saw two videos of   men shot by police, followed by a sniper attack in Dallas that left five police officers dead, he feels ”like a victim of both sides.” ”I feel for the families. I live both those lives,” an emotional Sanders said in an interview Friday with Don Lemon on CNN’s Newsroom. For Sanders, it doesn’t matter if he’s in or out of uniform. He doesn’t feel safe. ”This morning, I woke up and I was afraid for my safety . .. jumping into my patrol car to go to work. I was afraid,” he said.  But when he’s   he emphasized, he is fearful of the very profession for which he works. ”Yesterday, I forgot my wallet, and I had my gun. And I was pretty nervous,” he said. ”We are at a breaking point, where law enforcement and young black men like myself are at a place where we need to come together and talk about these problems.”
