PMW translated the song’s lyrics as follows: The Zionists coveted [our] homeland, Compounding damage and enmity, But the popular revolution awaits [them] The orchard called us to the struggle, We replaced bracelets with weapons, We attacked the despicable [Zionists] We do not want [internal] strife or disputes, While this invading enemy is on the battlefield, This is the day that jihad is needed, Pull the trigger. We shall redeem Jerusalem, Nablus and the country. The Yafa Cultural Center’s Facebook page describes itself as a cultural NGO formed by the Committee for the Defense of Palestinian Refugee Rights with the aim of improving “the cultural and intellectual condition of Palestinians by providing them with a space to develop their talents and skills and to enrich their awareness of their national rights through civic education particularly on democracy and human rights. ” Through a variety of activities the center hopes to “empower Palestinians in fostering a strong and independent identity   …     while escaping the negative effects of the   Israeli occupation. ” Official Palestinian Authority television broadcast a performance of the same song in 2010.
