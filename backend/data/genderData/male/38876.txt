 (CNN) Dennis Rodman took a wild ride this summer, authorities say.  The   NBA champion is charged with four misdemeanors after driving on the wrong side of a freeway, being involved in a hit and run, not having a valid license and lying to police, according to the Orange County District Attorney.  The incident happened in June in Santa Ana, California, when the former basketball player allegedly drove   toward another vehicle while on the wrong side of the freeway. The other driver swerved to avoid Rodman’s SUV and crashed into a concrete wall.  Rodman did not exchange information with the victim, authorities said. He fled the scene before the California Highway Patrol arrived, according to the district attorney’s office. Police said Rodman could face up to two years in jail if convicted. He is scheduled to be arraigned January 20 in Santa Ana.  ”We agree that if anything, this is a misdemeanor traffic matter, and certainly not a felony,” said Darren Prince, a representative for Rodman. ”We appreciate the district attorney’s evaluation and know that it should resolve successfully when all facts are considered.” This is not the first time the basketball Hall of Famer has faced the law. In 2000, Rodman was sentenced to probation and required to attend an alcohol program after pleading guilty to driving under the influence.
