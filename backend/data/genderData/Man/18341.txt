Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” Republican presidential  candidate Dr. Ben Carson said of his rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) “what does this tell you about a person? If they will allow a campaign in which people clearly do things that are underhanded. ”  When Bartiromo asked Carson if he accepted Cruz’s apology for his campaign falsely claiming Carson was dropping out of the presidential race during the Iowa caucus Carson said, “Of course I accept the apology,” Carson said. “I think what has to be looked at is, what does this tell you about a person? If they will allow a campaign in which people clearly do things that are underhanded, and if you accept that, what does that say you will do as president? So I think it should be a moment of enlightenment for people. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
