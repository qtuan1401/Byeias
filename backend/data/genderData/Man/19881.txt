From Sascha Segan writing at PC Mag:  Twitter stepped neatly into Lord of the Shitlords Milo Yiannopolous’s trap this week by permanently banning him from the service, thereby justifying his entire thesis that he is a lone flag carrier for “free speech” being persecuted by powerful forces.   …     Although Milo has been involved in nearly every   harassment controversy on the Internet, for some inexplicable reason, Twitter decided to ban him yesterday for supposedly inciting the massive racial harassment of Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones. That reached a fever pitch after trolls apparently faked screenshots of Jones’s Twitter account to make it look like she was tweeting racist and   filth. Perhaps Milo is responsible for that, but only in the way dry timber is responsible for a forest fire. Banning Milo is like burning a witch and then saying you’ve done something about the plague. It makes him a scapegoat and a   martyr while doing absolutely zero about the broader problem he represents, which is widespread, anonymous, sexist, racist, and   abuse. Like a Mafia don in a friendly,   prison, Milo will have no problem ordering his legions from exile. In fact, his street cred has now improved. Read the rest of the story at PC Mag.
