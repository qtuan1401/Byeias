Wisconsin governor Scott Walker said Thursday that in the event of a contested convention, the Republican nominee will likely be someone who is “not currently running. ”[“I think if it’s an open convention, it’s very likely it would be someone who’s not currently running,” Walker said.  “I mean, who knows. The one thing I qualify  —   it’s like the qualifications you see on those ads you see for car dealerships. I think any of us who comment on this election have to qualify that almost every prediction’s been off, so it’s hard to predict anything,” Walker added. Walker’s own run for the presidency went down in flames before the Iowa caucus even happened, due in large part to Walker hiring a D. C.  team that didn’t know how to manage a conservative Midwesterner. Convention head Paul Ryan has not definitively ruled out the possibility that he could get the nomination in Cleveland. John Boehner said that he would support Ryan on a second ballot. 🎵 Mister we could use a man like Willard Romney again 🎵 https:  .   —   Will Rahn (@willrahn) March 24, 2016,  🎵 Mister we could use a man like Willard Romney again 🎵 https:  .   —   Will Rahn (@willrahn) March 24, 2016,
