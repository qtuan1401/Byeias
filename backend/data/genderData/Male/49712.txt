’   Aleppo has been almost completely destroyed as the regime of   Syrian President Bashar   has fought to retake the eastern   part of the city from rebels. ’ ”   The commercial capital of Syria, Aleppo was once a thriving   city with Western chains, shopping centers, and beautiful   mosques. But there’s not much left standing anymore. ” ’   Ahmed Juventus, an aid worker in east Aleppo who goes by a   pseudonym, described the city as ”a wasteland of rocks.” ’ ’   ”The regime did not win, the regime exterminated all of Aleppo   and occupied an empty and destroyed city,” he told Business   Insider via voice messages on WhatsApp. ’ ’   Civilians are being evacuated from Aleppo under a ceasefire   agreement, but thousands still remain. The bombing by the regime   and its Russian allies has slowed, but  ’ ’   ”It has gotten better only in the sense that the shelling   stopped. The ceasefire did stop the shelling but the price was   that we had to leave our homes. People’’s hearts are broken as   they are now forced into exile from their place of birth and   hometown.” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   The scale of destruction in Aleppo is stunning. But rebels have   vowed to keep fighting the oppressive Assad regime. ’ ’   ”Syria is now in a state of war which is wins and losses. This is   Syria for now,” Juventus said. ”The revolution is still alive   even though our future is unknown. As long as the regime   continues to massacre people, we will continue.” ’ ’  ’
