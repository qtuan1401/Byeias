Sunday during the Democratic presidential debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton doubled down on a claim her campaign had made that her opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) wants to effectively dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.  According to Clinton, Sanders health care efforts would be a setback to ObamaCare, which she declared to be a “path to universal health care. ” “I certainly respect Sen. Sanders intention, but when you’re talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people’s health care. He didn’t like that. His campaign didn’t like it either. And tonight, he’s come out with a new health care plan, and again, we need to get into the details, but here’s what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States works since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Health Care Act passed. We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the republicans repeal it and I don’t to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it. ” In his response to Clinton, Sanders denied any of what she was saying was true and that it was his goal to achieve universal health care. “Secretary Clinton didn’t answer your question because what her campaign was saying, Bernie Sanders whose worked for universal health care my entire life, ‘He wants to end Medicare and Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance program.’ That is nonsense. What a    program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman, and child, as a right. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
