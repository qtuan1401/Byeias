The iconic DeLorean   featuring its unmistakable   doors and stainless steel body will be introduced with a variety of upgrades, according to MLive. [Although best known among younger generations due to the Back to the Future films, DeLoreans are also known for their distinctive design and the troubled history of the company’s founder, John DeLorean.  The current incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company, which has no connection to John DeLorean’s original company, was founded in order to service the active DeLorean enthusiast market. There are an estimated 6, 500 DeLoreans on the road today, out of the total production of 9, 000 cars. The 2017 DeLorean will follow the design of the classic cars, but include a variety of improvements such as a more powerful engine, different wheels with better brakes, and updated electronics. DeLorean’s website includes a production blog providing updates on specifications. DeLorean is planning to produce a maximum of 50 cars a year that are expected to retail for $100, 000. New DeLorean cars have been rumored in the past, but the production of new vehicles have been enabled by the passage in 2015 of a law to set up specific rules for low volume vehicle manufacturers. DeLorean considers the finalization of the rules outlined in this law as their final hurdle with the government. Previous to this law, companies like DeLorean planning to produce low volumes of replica vehicles were burdened with regulations appropriate for typical high volume vehicle manufacturers like Ford and Honda. Although Back to the Future was a bit off the mark with its prediction of flying cars by 2015, ironically two years after the second film in the series takes place we will have the first new DeLoreans rolling on the road in 35 years.
