’  ’ ”   At a recent event, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu   said that a division of troops would be stationed in Chukotka,   Russia’s   region, just slightly more than 50 miles from   Alaska. ” ’   ”There are plans to form a coastal defense division in 2018 on   the Chukotka operational direction,” said Shoigu. ’ ’   He said that the deployment was ”to ensure control of the closed   sea zones of the Kuril Islands and the Bering Strait, cover the   routes of Pacific Fleet forces’’ deployment in the Far Eastern and   Northern sea zones, and increase the combat viability of naval   strategic nuclear forces.” ’ ’   Japan and Russia dispute ownership of the northern Kuril Islands,   where . The Bering   Strait is the narrow waterway that separates Alaska from Russia. ’ ’   Broadly, Russia has  as melting ice caps open up new shipping lanes   between the East and West. In that context, the deployment of a   division to the sparsely populated Chukotka region makes sense. ’ ’   In the past, Russia has bemoaned NATO and US troop deployments   near to its borders. How the US will respond to this   deployment remains to be seen. ’
