Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is considering running for New York City mayor, according to a report by TMZ. [TMZ reports that a source who was at a small gathering last month with Clinton and “some politically connected people” from New York said the former presidential candidate “has not ruled” out the possibility and is “taking a real look at it. ”  Clinton also told the close circle to measure “the level of interest and support” to a potential Clinton candidacy. Rumors of Clinton running for mayor to resurrect her political career after a humiliating defeat in November have been swirling around in New York political circles since the beginning of the year. But, despite the growing speculation, Clinton has not yet publicly commented whether she would mull a challenge against the incumbent, Bill de Blasio. ”Hillary for Mayor” signs spotted in NYC. pic. twitter.   —   Alexandra Rosenmann (@alexpreditor) March 1, 2017,
