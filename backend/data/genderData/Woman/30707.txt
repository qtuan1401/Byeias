The New York Post reports that Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s estranged husband has been visited by New York City’s children welfare office after the latest scandal surrounding the disgraced former Congressman broke:    officials are investigating Anthony Weiner in the wake of The Post’s exclusive report that he sent a lewd selfie that showed his young son lying in bed next to him, sources said Wednesday. The probe of Weiner was launched by the Administration for Children’s Services over his handling of    son Jordan, a city government source told The Post. Agency protocol requires a home visit within 48 hours, and ACS showed up at Weiner and estranged wife Huma Abedin’s Union Square apartment building on Tuesday, a worker there confirmed. Such initial visits are meant to ensure that a possibly   child has a room to sleep in and food to eat, the government source said. Exclusive video shot by The Post showed Weiner leaving his building alone around 6 a. m. Tuesday, and it was unclear if ACS gained access to his apartment.   Read the full story here.
