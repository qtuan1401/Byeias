’  ’ ’   Cam Newton was unhappy with the officiating after the Carolina   Panthers beat the Arizona Cardinals,   on Sunday. ’ ’   Though he was officially sacked just once and knocked down four   times, Newton felt that once again he was subjected to late hits   by defenders. ’ ’   Newton addressed the situation after the game, saying he was   going to talk to the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, about the   situation because he no longer felt safe on the field. ’ ’   ”It’’s really taking the fun out of the game for me,” Newton said.   ”Honestly, it really is. Because, at times, I don’’t even feel   safe.” ’ ’   Newton continued, saying that when he brought the issue up to   refs throughout his career, they said they missed the calls.   Newton called it ”bullcrap.” ’ ’   ”The story of my life, ever since I came in, was, ’’Oh, I missed   that one. Oh, I’’m sorry, I’’ll try to get it. ’’ That’’s bullcrap,   that’’s bullcrap. Players in this league, we do something stupid,   we get fined . .. And I can’’t just keep accepting, ’’Oh, we missed   that one,’’ or, ’’I apologize for doing that,’’ or, ’’I didn’’t see   it. ’’ That’’s horsecrap.” ’ ”   Newton said that for every flag a different quarterback draws for   taking a hit, he could name a hit in which he didn’t draw a flag.   When asked what his breaking point in Week 8 was, Newton said a   particular play could have torn his ACL. ” ”   Here’s video of some of the Cardinals’ hits on Newton, with   Newton’s postgame comments, via Fox: ” ’ ’ ”   Hits on Newton have been a point of contention since the   Panthers’ first game of the season. Facing the Denver Broncos,    some of   which came late (after he had gotten rid of the ball) and went   uncalled. Additionally, Newton wasn’t taken out of the game to   undergo tests for a concussion. ” ’  ’
