A White House official is blaming a “technical issue” for the sudden loss of sound on a White House video in which French President François Hollande said the words “Islamist terrorism. ”[Yesterday, a video of Hollande’s remarks was pulled from the White House website, according to a report from the Media Research Center. The video was reloaded on the website with a version that not only muted the French president’s remarks in French but eliminated the English translation as well.  A copy of the White House translation of Hollande’s remarks, however, showed that he referred to “Islamist terrorism. ” We are also making sure that between Europe and the United States there can be a very high level coordination. But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq. We therefore have to act both in Syria and in Iraq, and this is what we’re doing within the framework of the coalition. “The written transcript that was sent out from the White House and posted online is and has been accurate since it was released,” a White House official replied to Breitbart News when asked for comment. A second video of his remarks, posted by the Nuclear Security Summit, also included Hollande’s reference to “Islamist terrorism. ” But the White House says that their version of the video was faulty. “A technical issue with the audio during the recording of President Hollande’s remarks led to a brief drop in the audio recording of the English interpretation,” the official explained. “As soon as this was brought to our attention, we posted an updated video online with the complete audio, which is consistent with the written transcript we released yesterday. ” The link to the original video reappeared on the White House website today after the MRC report of the video landed on the Drudge Report.
