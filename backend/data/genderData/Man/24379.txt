Thursday during a segment about the future of black Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith addressed the white people who call him racist and the black people who call him an Uncle Tom, telling them he “doesn’t give a damn. ”  “White folks, some white folks, not most, not all, but some white folks call me racist. And some black folks call me an Uncle Tom. I don’t give a damn about either side. I’m a   individual,” he said on ESPN2’s “First Take. ” While Smith advocates the hiring of more black head coaches in the NFL, he indicated that Lewis’ tenure Bengals should be coming to an end.
