She continued: “I want a female president so that I can say to my daughter one day, you too can become president of the United States. I believe in that symbolic importance,” she said. “But I have seen symbolism in election, symbolism that fails the people that so desperately need the action to make change. The model added: “I want my first female president to be more than a symbol, I want her to have politics that can revolutionize. ” #notherefortheboys #VoteTogether #FeelTheBern pic. twitter.   —   Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) February 8, 2016,  Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Ratajkowski expounded on her comments, and questioned Hillary’s liberal credentials. “I understand the urge to want to support   …     a Democratic female candidate who has completely earned her stripes,” Ratajkowski said. “My initial response to Hillary was a positive one   …     depending on your politics, if you don’t agree with some of the things that, you know, I think are pretty extreme and very, very   …     to the right of where I’d like to see the party headed, it’s really that simple to me. ” Gloria Steinem told HBO’s Bill Maher last Friday young women are flocking to support Sanders over Clinton because they are chasing “the boys. ” “When you’re young, you’re thinking, ‘Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie,’” the feminist told Maher. Watch Ratajkowski’s full New Hampshire speech below:
