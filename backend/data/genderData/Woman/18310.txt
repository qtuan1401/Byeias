The FBI has arrested a mother of two teenaged daughters in Wisconsin, charging her with forcing her girls into prostitution, the agency revealed. [The FBI noted that the case in Racine, Wisconsin, was broken when an agent discovered that the woman was advertising the sex services of her daughters on a website. Upon investigating, the Bureau discovered the woman pimping out her   and    children to men looking for sex for hire.  The mother was one of 23 arrested after being seen advertising on the site or patronizing those who did. The FBI said Milwaukee agents rescued 11 minors between the ages of 14 and 17, WISN reported. The Bureau announced that the arrests came as a result of “Operation Cross Country X,” a joint operation to rescue children from exploitation, initiated by the agency, local law enforcement, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The FBI stated that the operation tracked cases of exploited children from Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand, Canada, and the United States and has led to the rescue of up to 82 minors and the arrest of about 239 sex traffickers.
