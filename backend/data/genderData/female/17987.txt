Megyn Kelly’s accusations of sexual harassment against former Fox News chief Roger Ailes will be the subject of a new film from   The Big Short screenwriter Charles Randolph. [According to Variety, Annapurna Pictures (the studio behind Seth Rogen’s raunchy animated comedy Sausage Party) has snagged the rights to the project, which will also center on the allegations made by other women against Ailes, including those of former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson.  Annapurna’s Megan Ellison will   alongside Margaret Riley and Randolph, while Randolph is also slated to write the script. Kelly detailed her allegations against Ailes in her   memoir Settle for More, in which she wrote that the    former chairman and CEO of Fox News made improper   advances toward her shortly after she joined the network in 2005. “Roger began pushing the limits. There was a pattern to his behavior,” Kelly wrote in her memoir. “I would be called into Roger’s office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of    game with me  —   veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e. g. about the ‘very sexy bras’ I must have and how he’d like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice. ” Ailes has vehemently denied all of the allegations made against him. He resigned from Fox News in July of this year. The   film will reportedly be the second project to tackle the subject matter after Jason Blum’s    television project based on author Gabriel Sherman’s reporting on Ailes.
