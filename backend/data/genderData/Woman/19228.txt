Perennial   Jaden Smith has found an outlet for his unusual fashion choices  —   the    son of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith has been announced as the new face of fashion house Louis Vuitton’s   2016 women’s collection. [Louis Vuitton Creative Director Nicolas Ghesquiere broke the news Sunday by posting two photos to his Instagram account of Smith wearing a skirt from the new collection.

The famously   young actor donned a dress to attend a high school prom in May, but was spotted experimenting with women’s clothing even before then. In June, Smith wore a white   Batman costume to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s wedding. In an interview with GQ earlier this year, the Karate Kid star explained how he decides what to wear each day. “I’m just expressing how I feel inside, which is really no particular way because everyday it changes how I feel about the world and myself, but I like wearing super drapey things so I can feel as though I’m a super hero, but don’t have to necessarily wear super hero costumes everyday,” Smith told the magazine.
