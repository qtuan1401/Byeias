Supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders  —   who last night won four primary states against Hillary Clinton’s seven  —   have rallied in London to show their support and draw attention to absentee voting. [Sen. Sanders’s supporters took to Parliament Square to express their support for the      Democrat politician.  Recently, Sen. Sanders’s followers were spotted in London’s Borough Market approaching people with American accents, asking them if they needed absentee ballots for the Democratic primaries. The model is a far cry from Hillary Clinton’s   activities, which include £   celebrity fundraising dinners at lavish West London homes. PICTURES:
