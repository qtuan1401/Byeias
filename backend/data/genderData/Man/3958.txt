“Saturday Night Live” is adding three cast members as it enters its 42nd season, NBC announced on Monday. The season begins Oct. 1. One, Mikey Day, has been a writer for the show since 2013, while the others, Melissa Villaseñor and Alex Moffat, are new to “Saturday Night Live. ” All three have been brought on as featured players. In August, NBC announced that three cast members  —   the principals Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah, and a featured player, Jon Rudnitsky  —   would not return for the   season. Mr. Day, who this year was a head writer and cast member on the NBC variety show “Maya  Marty,” has also been a member of the Los Angeles troupe the Groundlings, which counts other “Saturday Night Live” stars, including Kristen Wiig and Will Forte, among its alumni. (“Maya  Marty,” which, like “Saturday Night Live,” is produced by Lorne Michaels, has not yet been renewed for a second season.) Ms. Villaseñor performs   comedy and impressions, which are central to the show’s brand of political satire during election seasons. Mr. Moffat has been onstage in Chicago with the iO and Annoyance Theaters.
