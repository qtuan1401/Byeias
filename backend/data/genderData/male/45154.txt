’  ’ ’   The Golden State Warriors avenged their 2016 Finals collapse with   a   win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 to win the   2017 championship. ’ ”   The title marks the Warriors’ second in three years, and   potentially, the beginning of a dynasty. ” ’   After going up   in the series, the Warriors ran into a Cavs   team with perhaps more fight left than anyone expected. Following   a Game 4 trouncing in Cleveland, the Cavs once again gave the   Warriors a test in Game 5, buoyed by the    magic of   LeBron James and Kyrie Irving and some hot shooting from J. R.   Smith. ’ ’   But in the fourth quarter, leading by five, the Warriors turned   to the man they brought in to get them back over the hump: Kevin   Durant. Durant was nearly flawless in Game 5, scoring 39 points   on   shooting, with seven rebound and five assists. ’ ”   He wasn’t alone, of course. Stephen Curry chipped in 34 points on     shooting with six rebounds and 10 assists. The Warriors   also got a huge game from Andre Iguodala off the bench, as he   contributed 20 points in 38 minutes and dutifully locked down   Irving and James. ” ’’ ’   In the process, the Warriors may be looking at the beginning of a   dynasty. They face a big offseason, with the free agencies of   Durant, Curry, Iguodala, and Shaun Livingston. But Durant is   reportedly willing to take less than the max to   with the   Warriors. In doing so, the Warriors will not need cap space to     Iguodala and Livingston. And Curry, after years of being   underpaid, will be eligible of a max contract worth approximately   $205 million over five years. ’ ’   The Warriors have a core of four   stars, in their primes,   eligible to be locked up long term. Odds are, this is not the   last we see of them. ’ ’The Golden State Warriors avenged their 2016. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
