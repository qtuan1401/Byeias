He also   debuted    where people can submit resumes for leadership positions in his   government. ” ’   ”It’s 40 days until I take the oath of office,” Cooper said in   a news release. ”It would be irresponsible to wait any   longer to tackle the issues we campaigned on across the state.” ’ ”   But McCrory hasn’t given up  —   his team lodged ballot   challenges in 50 of North Carolina’s 100 counties,   in some cases alleging votes were fraudulently   cast by dead people and convicted felons. But some of the   challenges were thrown out because of a lack of evidence. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   McCrory can call for a statewide recount if his final deficit   is within 10, 000 votes of Cooper. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’    ’
