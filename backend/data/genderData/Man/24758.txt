Several top journalists and TV news anchors RSVPed “yes” to attend a private,    gathering at the New York home of Joel Benenson, the chief campaign strategist for Hillary Clinton, two days before she announced her candidacy in 2015, according to emails Wikileaks has published from John Podesta’s purported accounts.  The guest list for an earlier event at the home of John Podesta was limited to reporters who were expected to cover Clinton on the campaign trail. The email thread starts with Jesse Ferguson, the campaign’s Deputy National Press Secretary and Senior Spokesman, describing the venues and target audience of each gathering: We wanted to make sure everyone on this email had the latest information on the two upcoming dinners with reporters. Both are   . 1) Thursday night, April 9th at 7:00p. m. Dinner at the Home of John Podesta  …     This will be with about 20 reporters who will closely cover the campaign (aka the bus). 2) Friday night, April 10th at 6:30p. m. Cocktails and Hors D’oeuvre at the Home of Joel Benenson  …     This is with a broader universe of New York reporters. The “broader universe of New York reporters” includes several top news anchors for network and cable channels, many of whom are listed as a “yes” for the appearance: From ABC: Cecilia Vega, David Muir, Diane Sawyer (who could only stay for 30 minutes) and George Stephanopoulos. From CBS News: Norah O’Donnell. From CNN: Brianna Keilar, Gloria Borger, John Berman, and Kate Bolduan. From MSNBC: Alex Wagner and Rachel Maddow (“TRYING”). From NBC: Savannah Guthrie. “Yes” respondent George Stephanopoulos worked for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign and was a Senior Adviser to the President during Clinton’s first White House term. Stephanopoulos does not disclose this fact when reporting on the 2016 Clinton campaign for ABC News. The nascent Clinton campaign invited Jeff Zucker and Phil Griffin, the presidents of CNN and MSNBC, respectively. Zucker declined while Griffin RSVPed “yes. ” Wikileaks’ release of emails from the Democratic National Committee showed   Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz scheduled or attempted to schedule private meetings with both executives. Other “yes” RSVPs come from journalists who have been sighted in the Wikileaks Podesta emails, outing them as friendly or fawning towards Hillary’s campaign. CNBC’s John Harwood, who was also a moderator for a 2015 presidential debate, emailed Podesta frequently, practically begging for approval and access. Politico’s Glenn Thrush also emailed Podesta periodically. On Monday, a   email revealed a particularly humiliating incident where Thrush sent Podesta a passage from an upcoming article for his personal approval. “Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u,” Thrush wrote. “Please don’t share or tell anyone I did this  …     Tell me if I fucked up anything. ” Sandra Sobieraj Westfall, Washington Bureau Chief at PEOPLE magazine, boasted two days after this confab that stories on Clinton’s campaign were generating “absolutely off the charts” traffic and asked for “color you can whisper on background” about what Hillary was up to. The full RSVP list for Benenson’s gathering is shown in an attachment on a separate email: This is an    cocktails with the key national reporters, especially (though not exclusively) those that are based in New York. Much of the group includes influential reporters, anchors and editors. The goals of the dinner include:(1) Give reporters their first thoughts from team HRC in advance of the announcement( 2) Setting expectations for the announcement and launch period( 3) Framing the HRC message and framing the race( 4) Enjoy a Frida night drink before working more,  : As a reminder, this is called for 6:30 p. m. on Friday, April 10th .
