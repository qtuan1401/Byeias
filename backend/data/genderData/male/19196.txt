The video of a woman marching through a Target store in protest of the chain’s   bathroom policy is going viral on YouTube, drawing almost 400, 000 views in only four days. [The video shows a woman carrying a Bible and telling customers that the department store’s   bathroom policy is dangerous.  On the video, the woman says she is a “mother of 12” and insists the bathroom practice is “wicked,” opens Target’s bathrooms to “perverted men,” and represents the retail chain’s “perverted” LGBT agenda. A group of young people, perhaps her family, are seen in the video marching with her.  By her accent the woman is clearly from the Midwest, but neither the woman nor the location of the store was made known by the YouTube poster, on an account that is only a month old. The video comes a month after Target announced it intended to allow men claiming to be women to use the women’s bathrooms and changing rooms at its U. S.  stores. It was a decision that sparked a boycott petition effort which garnered over 1. 2 million signers in only a week. The move has also likely led in part to a downfall in profits and stock price for the retailer. By some accounts, Target has lost several billion dollars in stock value over the last month since the policy was announced.
