’  ’ ’   Lawmakers in three states have filed bills that would regulate   bathroom access in public buildings, despite cries from critics   who call the bills discriminatory against transgender residents. ’ ’   Language used in the proposed ”bathroom bills”  —   filed in    on Thursday, and    and    earlier this week  —   mirrors that of North Carolina’’s House   Bill 2, a law that polarized the nation and led to  of lost statewide revenue. ’ ’   All three bills would effectively force transgender   residents to use the public restrooms and locker rooms that   correspond to their biological sex as listed on their birth   certificates, rather than their gender identity. ’ ’   While none of the proposed bills use the word ”transgender,”   LGBT advocates are already condemning them,   arguing they needlessly single out the transgender   community. ’ ’   ”Across the country   …      ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Patrick has been an outspoken proponent of  which on top of the bathroom provision,   also prevents local governments from passing     ordinances to protect LGBT residents. ’ ”   Since HB2’s passage in March, North Carolina has seen   businesses boycott the state and freeze major expansions,     musicians cancel shows, and the NBA relocate   the 2017   Game, originally scheduled for Charlotte. ” ’   The economic fallout in Texas could be even more damaging. A    unveiled this week found   that   laws could cost Texas as much as $8. 5 billion and   185, 000 jobs. ’ ”   Robert Marshall, the Virginia delegate, did not respond to a   request for comment, nor did Democratic Rep. Rick Nelson,   architect of Kentucky’s bill, or Republican Sen. Lois Kolkhorst,   who wrote the Texas bill. ”
