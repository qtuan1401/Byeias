 (CNN)”You’re so hot!” Like most fathers would be, Chris ”Burr” Martin was taken aback when he saw that comment posted in response to one of his    daughter Cassie’s sexy selfies on her Instagram account. Instead of telling her to stop posting the photos or giving her a lengthy lecture, the Spokane,   comedian creatively decided to take some selfies of his own. ”I did it because she posted something and the guys in the comment section were too much,” Martin said. ”So to put water on the fire, I posted one like it and said, ’What about me, guys?’ and that did it.” Martin has   five of Cassie’s selfies and proudly posted them to his Instagram account. Yes, the   ”selfie dad” has even mastered the duck face. He now has more than 16, 000 followers on Instagram. How did Cassie react? ”She rolled her eyes at first, but once she saw her friends thought it was funny, she was OK with it,” Martin said. ”I enjoy making people laugh.”  Martin is just one of many fathers in the United States who have used humor as a part of parenting and have drawn lots of attention while doing it. In 2013, Utah dad Scott Mackintosh wore   shorts in a photo posted online when he didn’t want his daughter Myley to wear shorts shorter than what he approved of. Just like Cassie, Myley couldn’t help but chuckle. ”My dad’s humor has always been twisted in with his parenting,” Cassie said. ”I think some parents should tie in some comedy with their opinions on certain life choices their kids make, but understand your child first before doing it. Different families have different ways to express their voices.”
