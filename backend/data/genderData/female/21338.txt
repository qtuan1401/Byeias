Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review argues that Republican lawmakers “are planning to promote the Muslim Brotherhood’s agenda” as a response to the Orlando terror attack. [From Conservative Review:  You can’t make this stuff up. Democrats respond to Islamic terrorist attacks by blaming inanimate objects. Now Republicans are planning to promote the Muslim Brotherhood’s agenda. Which response is worse? Next, Republicans could bring legislation to the House and Senate floors finally designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group, thereby freeing up law enforcement do expunge them from our government and go after the mosques controlled by Brotherhood front groups.

It would also remove the Muslim Brotherhood foxes guarding the hen house within our sensitive counterterrorism advisory boards for the FBI and DHS. The bill designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terror group (H. R. 3892) already passed the House Judiciary Committee in February. But no. Republicans will have none of that.
