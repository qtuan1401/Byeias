Tuesday on CNN’s “Wolf,” Democratic National Committee chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) speculated on how her party will ultimately select its presidential nominee.  Wasserman Schultz told host Wolf Blitzer that despite the possibility of unpledged delegates making it possible for Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton to win over Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) without getting the lion’s share of the popular vote, she expected the pledged delegates selected by the voters to be enough to determine who the nominee will be. “There are 719 unpledged delegates and they have up until the actual convention to make a decision on who they’ll vote for and they have never made a difference in deciding who our nominee is and I don’t expect them to now,” she said. “I think the nominee will ultimately be selected by pledged delegates that were selected by voters. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
