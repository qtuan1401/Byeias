April 20, 2017   Authorities tell CNN that they are taking steps to seek the arrest of Assange, preparing criminal charges against the WikiLeaks founder. The investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks dates back to 2010 but prosecutors struggled with the question of whether the First Amendment protected Assange. Now, they reportedly have found a way to proceed but offered no details on the nature of the charges they plan to file.     May 3, 2017   During a Senate hearing, FBI director James Comey refers to WikiLeaks as ”intelligence porn,” declaring that the site’s disclosures are intended to damage the US rather than educate the public. ”People can argue that maybe there is conduct WikiLeaks has engaged in the past that’s closer to regular news gathering but in my view, a huge portion of WikiLeaks’ activities has nothing to do with legitimate news gathering,” Comey says.  May 17, 2017   Manning is released from prison.
