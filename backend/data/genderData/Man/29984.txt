CNN, the   cable news network, is in the middle of another round of layoffs. Nevertheless, according to Page Six, 40 staffers are set to lose their jobs and CNN star (and Jeff Zucker favorite) Robin Meade is about to enjoy a $100, 000 toilet:  CNN staffers are hopping mad that bosses are building anchor Robin Meade an expensive private toilet while employees are being laid off at their Atlanta headquarters. HLN anchor Meade has demanded a loo and a sink in her office at Atlantaâ€™s CNN Center, and, according to internal   the lavish latrine could cost up to $100, 000. But the malodorous move has been met with fury by CNN International staffers who have been told to reapply for their jobs. As in our government when Leftists take over, under President Zucker, the rich get richer at CNN as the little guy gets screwed.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
