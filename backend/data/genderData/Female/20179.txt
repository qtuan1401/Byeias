Author and activist Gloria Steinem argued that younger women are supporting Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) over fellow candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton because they’re going where the boys are and “The boys are with Bernie” on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time. ”  Steinem said that Clinton’s lack of support among younger women was partially due to the fact that “Men tend get more conservative because they gain power as they age, and women get more radical because they lose power as they age.
