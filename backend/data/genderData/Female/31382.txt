A disabled Air Force veteran and his dog were both recently hired by a Texas Lowe’s store, Fox 8 reports.  Clay Luthy cannot work without his service dog, Charlotte, which has made finding work difficult. Charlotte, a    golden retriever, is trained to help Luthy if he falls. Luthy has undergone five surgeries on his left knee after being deployed three times to Uzebekistan and two times to Qatar, and the knee does not bend very far. We went through the interview process, and Clay and his own merit won the job,” said Jay Fellers, a human resource manager for Lowe’s. “And we knew he was gonna make a great employee —   we just got the benefit of getting Charlotte right along with him. ” “I’m just a disabled vet, and I can’t stand to be sitting at home. Instead of medications, I have Charlotte,” Luthy said. Luthy was worried when he applied at Lowe’s, but Fellers assured him that service dogs work “all throughout” Lowe’s. Luthy and Charlotte both got the job and sport the Lowe’s vest. A Facebook user uploaded this photo of the pair: Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
