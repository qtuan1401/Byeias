This week on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” Kate McKinnon as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoofed an ad mocking Clinton’s desperate attempts to get votes.  In the ad, McKinnon’s Clinton sounded eerily like her fellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) and she eventually transformed into a creepy looking Sanders in the end. Partial transcript as follows: “I know you millennials. You’re fired up, you’re angry and I’m angry, too. Because the top 10 percent of the top one percent controls 90 percent of the wealth in this country. And I’ve always said that. Ever since I was a young boy growing up in Brooklyn. “And when it comes to that darn Wall Street, I’ve always believed no bank can be too big to fail. No executives too  —   you know the rest. It’s that famous mobilizing sentence that works on you guys that I’ve been saying this whole time. So thank you, millennials, for lending your support to the biggest outsider Jew in the race  —   Hillary Rodham Clinton. There’s a lot of work to be done, and that is why I am sick and tired of hearing about my own damn  . ” She concluded the ad, saying, “I’m whoever you want me to be, and I approve this message. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
