’’ ’Salesforce shares dropped as much as 8% in   trading on Wednesday following a soft guidance and billings growth .’ ’Its   revenue guidance was slightly lower than analyst forecasts of $2. 13 billion, while deferred ’ ’Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff admitted that ”softness” at the end of the quarter, particularly in the US market, was attributed to the lower than expected results, although he pointed out that it’’s temporary and part of the normal   sales cycle.’ ’’ ’’ ”Keith Block, Salesforce’s president and COO, added that the company followed up with a thorough review process of its US business and came back confident that it’ll turn it around in the second half of the year. He also highlighted that it signed another huge enterprise deal worth over $100 million in the quarter, the   quarter when it’s signed a   deal.” ’Block continued:’ ”In fact, despite unfavorable    changes that affected its overall business, Salesforce was still able to raise its   guidance for the third time this year to the range of $8. 275 billion to $8. 325 billion. That’s on top of an earnings beat that gave the company it’s first $2   revenue quarter  —   a 25% increase   .” ”Given that enterprise software typically closes a lot more deals in the second half of the year, Salesforce’s numbers could improve as management indicated. Rather, it could be a case of the market just having grown used to seeing Salesforce hit record numbers quarter after quarter, as its stock price has jumped 30% over the past two years.” ’’
