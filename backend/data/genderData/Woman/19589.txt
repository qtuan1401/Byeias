A Saudi court ruling allowing a woman to watch her husband’s flogging, which he received as punishment for biting her, has been a cause for concern for some of the kingdom’s men. [In addition to three days’ imprisonment for assaulting his wife, the man was sentenced to 30 lashes for the crime and an additional 30 as “reparation” for his wife.  The fact that the woman would be allowed to watch his flogging has been seen by many as a deliberate attempt to humiliate him. “The fact that the court allowed her to watch the punishment being carried out is in itself another punishment,” Fahde wrote. @HashKSA (وتتيح للمرأة حضور التنفيذ) هذا بحد ذاته جلد إضافي 😊  —   فهدة محمد (@too0old) October 26, 2016,  “Great, he should learn how to behave,” Yasmina wrote. “Inshallah men like him will start to fear the consequences. ” @HashKSA احسن خليه يتربى ، و ان شاء الله يخاف الي زيه 🙂👏🏻👏🏻  —   ياسمينة 🎙 (@DSemony) October 26, 2016,  “Great, I’d like to see him get it before his wife,” Reem wrote. @HashKSA ههههههه احسسسن ودي اشوفه وهو ينجلد قدامها,  —   ريم (@reemalsahli_s) October 26, 2016,  A livid Mohamed Almteiri tweeted: “If I were the judge I’d tell the woman to get lost before I bite her as well. ” @HashKSA لوني من القاضي تفلت بوجه الزوجه وقلتلها اذلفي برا لأعضك انا بعد 😂💔  —   محمد المطيري’ (@Mohamed3055) October 26, 2016,  An angry woman replied: “That’s because you were brought up a primitive. ” @Mohamed3055 @HashKSA لأنك متربي على التخلف.  —   Besh The Lawyer♑️.
