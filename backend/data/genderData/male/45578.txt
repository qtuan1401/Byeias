’The Miami Heat are in a slump, having lost eight of their last ten games.’ ’The Heat are one of the worst offensive teams in the NBA, ranking 22nd in offensive rating and 27th in   shooting, hitting just 32. 9% of their attempts.’ ”To try and give their offense a boost, they’ve been looking at an unlikely source  —   and apparently have been for quite some time.” ” the Heat have been trying to lure    sharpshooter Ray Allen out of retirement for the last two years, with little success. The Heat tried to sign him last season, when he reportedly was weighing a return, but ultimately didn’t. Skolnick reports that the Heat have reached out to him again, through multiple mediums, this season, leaving him a standing offer to return.” ”However, according to Skolnick, it’s not going well.” ”Allen is famously one of the most fit players to ever play the game, keeping himself in tremendous shape. Yet he hasn’t played since the   season, and at 40, there would be quite an adjustment period needed for him to give a team valuable minutes.” ”What’s strange, however, is that Miami seems so bent on signing Allen. The Heat aren’t a young team built around several notable veterans, including their stars, Dwyane Wade (34) and Chris Bosh (31). Whereas most teams turn to the   to give tryouts to young, hungry players, it’s odd that the Heat continue to knock on Allen’s door.” ”Based on Skolnick’s report and Allen’s decision not to play last year, it seems the Heat and the rest of the NBA have little chance of signing him.”
