An online study performed by digital security company AVG Technologies claims children are more proficient in operating a smartphone than in completing basic everyday tasks. [According to AVG Technologies, 58% of children aged between 3 and 5 can successfully operate a smartphone but fewer than 1 in 6 can perform simple tasks such as making their own breakfast. Tim Elmore, founder of Growing Leaders, a non profit organisation based out of Georgia that works with schools and civic groups to promote leadership qualities in children, said, “I see many parents doing everything for their kids instead of letting them figure out how to fend for themselves. ”  Understandably many skills such as   a letter have slowly become less important in our modern world due to the rise of technology however skills such as cooking, cleaning, and navigating are still relatively essential. Parenting experts suggest that parents spend time with their kids, teaching them how to develop skills that can be used in day to day life as well as fostering a healthy interest in other aspects such as gardening. It’s long been claimed by older generations that technology has limited the ability of children to communicate effectively. While there may be downsides such as limiting creativity and affecting sleep patterns, by allowing children to use this technology, we must also be realistic in our understanding of how fast technology is progressing these days and how essential it has become in day to day life.  As with all things, and especially with children, moderation and supervision is very much needed.
