Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said he has a “problem” with the “many millions of dollars” his opponent Democratic   Hillary Clinton’s foundation has gotten in donations from foreign dictatorships.  Partial transcript as follows: TAPPER: You have not been critical of the Clinton Foundation but there are those who say there’s something inherently wrong with an American charity especially one with ties to a secretary of state taking money from the Saudis and other foreign governments that don’t represent our values. Is that a fair criticism? SANDERS: Yes it is. You asked me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, governments which are dictatorships. You don’t have a lot of civil liberties, democratic rights in Saudi Arabia. You don’t have a lot of respect there for opposition points of view for gay rights, for women’s rights. Yes, do I have a problem with that, yeah, I do. TAPPER: Do you think it creates the appearance of conflict of interest? SANDERS: I do. I do. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
