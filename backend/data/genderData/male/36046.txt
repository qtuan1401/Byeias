Washington (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to President Barack Obama in honor of Independence Day, the Kremlin government said Monday. In the message, Putin signaled he wanted the U. S. and Russia to resume a positive relationship.  ”The history of   relations shows that when we act as equal partners and respect each other’s lawful interests, we are able to successfully resolve the most complex international issues for the benefit of both countries’ peoples and all of humanity,” Putin wrote, according to the Russian readout. The Kremlin said Putin suggested past work between the two countries would ”help to set the dialogue between Russia and the United States back on a constructive track” to address global concerns.  The White House declined to comment on the message Monday.  The message comes amid tensions between the Russia and the U. S. Russian warships and planes have been engaging in aggressive maneuvers with U. S. military forces, and Moscow has engaged in Syria in ways the United States has said is not constructive in the fight against ISIS.
