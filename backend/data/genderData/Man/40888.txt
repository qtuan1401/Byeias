Washington (CNN) Ben Carson says President Barack Obama is a psychopath.  His comment came in an exchange between the neurosurgeon who’s likely to mount a bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and his chief adviser, Armstrong Williams, captured by a GQ reporter on the night of this year’s State of the Union address. Williams had said Obama looked ”elegant” that night.  And Carson responded: ”Like most psychopaths. That’s why they’re successful. That’s the way they look. They all look great.”  Later in the exchange, Carson accused Obama of knowingly selling the American public ”a lie.”  ”He’s trying to sell what he thinks is not true!” Carson reportedly said. ”He’s sitting there saying, ’These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything. ’”  It’s the latest in a long string of controversial comments from Carson, who’s touted himself as an outsider    someone who isn’t a career politician and doesn’t carry himself as one.  His blunt comments about Obama have been part of Carson’s appeal to conservatives who have detested the President during his   years in office.  Carson has also compared Obama’s signature health care law to ”slavery,” and said homosexuality is a choice because some people enter prison straight and leave it gay.
