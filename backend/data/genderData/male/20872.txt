On March 23 Nebraska state senator Ernie Chambers ( . 11) said he would grab “a semiautomatic weapon” and “mow everybody down” if he were a white guy. [Chambers is black.  According to the Lincoln Journal Star, Chambers made the statement because he was “frustrated” with the political “debate on a measure to prohibit job discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. ” He viewed much of the debate from an office outside the Senate chamber, then said, “If I was up here I’d probably pick these books up and start throwing them around. If I was a white guy, I’d go get my semiautomatic weapon and come down here and mow everybody down. ” Afterward, Chambers stood his ground amid backlash from Senate colleagues and other office holders who thought his words went a step too far. He indicated that people should be glad that he was only talking, rather than following through with actions. Chambers said, “Be glad when the snake rattles, my words are all that I’m using. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
