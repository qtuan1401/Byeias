’  ’ ’     startup Otonomo is capitalizing on the fact that   cars, once the symbol of American escapism, are becoming   repositories of your personal data. ’ ’   Cars have only become connected to the internet in the last few   years, but sensors to support autonomous driving capabilities and   smart infotainment consoles are contributing to an influx of data   that the auto industry has never seen before. ’ ’   Big Data is poised to grow even more as automakers pursue fully     vehicles and the government preps to    allowing future cars to talk with each other while driving. ’ ’ car data could   become a $750 billion industry by 2030. ’ ’   So it’s no wonder everyone wants a slice of the pie. ’ ’   ”The emergence of new business models and changes in existing   ones will not only unlock new customer segments, but will also   attract industry newcomers,” McKinsey & Co. wrote in its   report. ”Traditional car manufacturers will be joined by     providers,    mobility providers,   infrastructure providers, and insurers in the competition for the   connected customer as new services and business models will allow   them to access customers in the car and target this new value   pool.” ’ ’   That’s where Otonomo comes in. ’ ”   Founded in 2015, Otonomo uses a cloud solution to collect data,   organize it, and sell it to third parties. The startup says it   works with 9 major automakers and has a partnership with   Mercedes’ parent company Daimler, but declined to name the other   carmakers using its service. ” ’   The startup has raised $40 million in total funding and boasts   Steve Girsky, former vice chairman and board member of General   Motors, as a backer. ’ ’   ”Google and Apple are the best in the world at monetizing data.   They want to do it also in the car and the car guys understand   it,” Otonomo CEO and   Ben Volkow told Business Insider.   ”[Automakers] see us as a strategic partner to help play the same   game.” ’ ’   Otonomo has 70 partners buying up the data, ranging from players   in the retail space and insurance industry, Volkow said. More   than 1 million cars on the road are already connected to the   Otonomo platform, and that number will rise to 5 million by the   end of 2017. ’ ’   The startup splits whatever it makes selling the data with the   the automaker that supplies it. Volkow declined to say exactly   how much Otonomo takes away, but said it’s less than half. ’ ’  ’ ”   Otonomo is already selling vehicle owners’ data, but questions of   privacy still remain as cars are set to collect more data going   forward. ” ’   Currently, Otonomo adheres to the Driver Privacy Act of 2015 that   states all data collected by a vehicle is the property of the   owner or lessee of that vehicle unless the owner gives explicit   consent to share it. ’ ”   What drivers may not realize is that they have consented to hand   over that data simply by agreeing to the terms and services of   their infotainment consoles, like Daimler’s COMMAND or General   Motors’ OnStar. ” ’   The McKinsey report found vehicle owners are pretty evenly   divided when it comes to sharing this kind of information. ’ ’   Of the 3, 184 respondents surveyed, 55% said they would allow it   and 24% said they would not allow it under any circumstances. The   other 21% said they would share data that helped improve the   car’s product, under the condition it would not be sold to third   parties. ’ ’   That means 45% of people surveyed were opposed to their data   being sold to third parties. ’ ’   How consumers opt in and out of privacy standards may change. The   government is looking to mandate V2V communication, allowing cars   to communicate about traffic patterns and congestion in the   ultimate hope of cutting down accidents. ’ ’   But as mentioned earlier, that’s going to result in entirely new   streams of data being shared and collected. ’ ’   The Federal Trade Commission and National Highway Traffic Safety   Administration  the privacy and security issues   related to V2V on June 28. (The public comment period on the   topic closed Thursday.) ’ ’   The government will also have to address consumer privacy when it   comes to   vehicles. NHTSA released  for the vehicles in   September that include a safety assessment for consumer privacy,   but has yet to propose regulations. ’ ’   Still, there may be instances where consumers want to share   certain kinds of data, similar to how people use their   smartphones today. For example, drivers may elect to share their   location to get alerts about open parking spots nearby. ’ ’   Volkow mentioned other ways an open data platform could improve   the driving experience. Otonomo can monitor everything from tire   pressure to battery life, meaning it can inform a driver they   need to see a mechanic before a car breaks down. ’ ”   For   cars, fleet managers could receive alerts if   there’s problem and program the car to drive back to its home   base for further evaluation. ” ’   ”[Car manufacturers] will need to give you the visibility   somehow to see what is being done with your data and how to   control it,” Volkow said. ”But I think in many places there’s a   strong motivation for you to give it.” ’ ’  startup Otonomo is capitalizing on. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
