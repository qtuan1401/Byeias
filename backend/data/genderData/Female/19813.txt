Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to answer moderator Jorge Ramos’s question at the Democratic debate in Miami on Wednesday evening about whether she would drop out of the race if indicted over her email scandal. [At first, she dodged the question. When Ramos put it to her again, she dismissed it: “I’m not even answering that question,” Clinton said, to cheers.  Rival Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) again declined to comment. Ramos had also asked Clinton whether she had been given permission to use a personal   account for her State Department communications, even though her official policy had prohibited department employees from doing so. Clinton replied that she did not need permission, and claimed that her predecessors had also used personal   accounts. (That is true  —   but they did not use their own personal servers, or delete   they sent or received.) Speculation has mounted that Clinton may face indictment since an aide received immunity last week from prosecution in exchange for cooperation with the FBI. Ramos preceded his question by disclosing that his daughter works on Clinton’s campaign. The debate was   by CNN and Univision. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
