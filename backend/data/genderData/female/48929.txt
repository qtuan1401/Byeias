’  ’ ’   In California, where a doctor’s note will get you all the legal   weed you could ever want, companies are always looking for new   products to capitalize on the growing trend of legal marijuana   consumption. ’ ’   So it’s surprising that pot wine, even though it’s been around   since the days of ancient China, is just now starting to emerge   as a hot product. ’ ’   While many states have laws on the books that prohibit mixing   legal marijuana with alcohol or other drugs for sale, California   has no such law, so these winemakers are operating in a weird   grey market at the moment. ’ ’   That hasn’t kept them from acting like completely legit   operations, however. One company, the producers of Mary Jane   Wines, have been utilizing social media and     business summits to get the word out about their alcohol and weed   infused wine. ’ ’   As you can see, the wine really does take on a strange greenish   tint from the infusion. And while the mix could certainly be a   dangerous one in terms of knocking consumers off their feet, it’s   unlikely that people are going to go TOO wild with the wine, if   only because it’s really, really, really expensive.     range in price, depending on the winery, from $ $400. It’s no   wonder, at those prices, why so many new entrants are trying to   sell the product. ’ ’’ ’   Even folk singer Melissa Etheridge has got a dog in the fight   with her wine, No Label. She shares her experience with the wine   saying, “There’s a little flush after the first sip, but   then the effect is really cheery, and at the end of the night you   sleep really well. ” ’ ’   Haha. I’m sure sleep is not a problem after consuming this stuff. ’
