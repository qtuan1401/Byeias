Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Bloomberg Politics Mark Halperin, a   of the show “With All Due Respect” said that allegations of sexual misconduct aimed at former President Bill Clinton were never “disproven,” but instead were “confirmed. ”  Halperin pointed to a statement from his wife Hillary Clinton, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, arguing accusers have a right to be heard until their accusations are disproven. And that according to Halperin means those behind accusations aimed at Bill Clinton should be heard. “Hillary Clinton said that people have a right to be heard until their allegations are disproven,” he said. “And I think that in some of the most prominent cases, not only were the accusations not disproven, they were confirmed and acknowledged by President Clinton. ” Halperin listed examples of those allegations. “He acknowledged he had a relationship with Gennifer Flowers,” Halperin added. “He paid Paula Jones off in a settlement and has acknowledged much of what Monica Lewinsky said happened. So those are three pretty prominent examples. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
