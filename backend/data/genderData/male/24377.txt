Longtime Democrat pollster and consultant Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Thursday, “The thing that I think we all should be thankful for is that the American people decided they were going to   their sovereignty as the sovereign masters of this country and not the political class and their media outriders, who believed that the American people were pawns to be pushed around in some dynastic game between the Bushes, the Clintons, and others. ”[Caddell also said, “I’m thankful for my country that we at least put a halt  —   if we are not going to have massive change, at least we’re putting a halt  —   to what I think has been a descent in our national politics away from the American people having a say. ”  He also cited “corruption” as one of the major factors in this year’s election. “The word forbidden to be spoken in Washington was finally allowed to come to the surface. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
