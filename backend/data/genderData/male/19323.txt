The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and the Daily Mail, among other news outlets, published stories based on research from Breitbart News Senior    and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer revealing that Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta’s firm Joule Unlimited received millions from a   Russian government fund. [And despite the GAI report’s   news coverage, missing from the pack were   press shops. Among the New York Times, CNN, NBC, CBS, Washington Post, LA Times, POLITICO  —   not a single one has covered the bombshell revelation or reported asking Podesta for a comment on his involvement in Joule Unlimited.  This media blackout persists, oddly, after “John Podesta” catapulted to the top of Facebook North America’s treading topics list on Monday, thanks to Schweizer’s new Russia revelations. It’s obvious that these mainstream media firms  —   namely, CNN, NYT, and POLITICO  —   have no problem covering   stories. They’ve done so, repeatedly, over several news cycles. Do these alarming facts detailed in the   GAI report not warrant a question from Hillary Clinton, a candidate seeking America’s highest office? Or course they do. That John Podesta’s name was trending among America’s most popular news items on the world’s largest social media platform is evidence of immense interest from the public and, presumably, journalists. If contacting Joule Unlimited is the real obstacle, a link to company’s contact page has been provided here. What’s more, the executive summary of the GAI report, titled “From Russia with Money: Hillary Clinton, the Russian Reset, and Cronyism,” also includes bullet points that can easily be transformed into a useful line of inquiry.
