Twitter’s VP of Communications, Natalie Kerris, has quit her role after just 6 months at the head of the company’s PR operation, reports BuzzFeed. [Twitter has struggled to define itself and its product as the platform’s user growth continues to flounder. This was once again underscored by the company’s disappointing earnings report, which caused the value of Twitter’s stock to plunge by $1. 6 billion last week.

Its suspension of Milo Yiannopoulos has generated a   campaign of protest from angry Milo fans, who are often highly motivated conservative activists. So far, Twitter has seen   slogans scrawled outside its offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, NYC, Toronto and Dublin. A Milo activist even walked into Twitter’s London offices, asking to speak with the “ . ” Nor can the company escape its detractors on the web. During the company’s   earnings call, its #TWTR hashtag was flooded with young activists demanding answers over Milo’s suspension. CEO Jack Dorsey was ultimately compelled to address the controversy personally, although his comments are unlikely to calm the company’s detractors. Kerris, a former Apple employee, will be replaced by Leslie Berland, Twitter’s Chief Marketing Officer. Berland will now lead both marketing and communications at the company. With Twitter facing unprecedented problems, it’s likely that she now faces an even more difficult task than Kerris did when she joined the company. In a statement to Business Insider, Twitter said “During her time leading communications at Twitter, Natalie helped us share the Twitter story with the world. We are grateful for her energy and enthusiasm and the impact she’s had, even in this short time. We wish her all the best. ” You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.
