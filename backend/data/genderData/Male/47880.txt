’   We are already getting glimpses of what the retooled Golden State   Warriors will look like. ’ ”   Though Stephen Curry is sitting out the Olympics, new Warrior   Kevin Durant is playing alongside Klay Thompson and Draymond   Green in the US Men’s National Basketball Team scrimmages, and he   is already trying to pick up some of the Warriors’ habits. ” ”   During Tuesday’s scrimmage between Team USA and China, Durant   drove the lane and threw a nice pass to a   Kyle Lowry in   the corner. As Warriors players are wont to do, Durant then threw   his hands up in celebration, played with the crowd, and began   running the other way before the shot went up, assuming it would   go in. ” ’   Unfortunately for Durant, Lowry missed the  . ’ ’ ’ ’   This is one of the cockier examples of this mishap, mostly   because Durant was waving the crowd on, confident the shot was   going down. In past examples, players might begin running the   other way, but rarely do they gesture as obviously as Durant. ’ ”   Durant does have company, however. His former Thunder teammate   Steven Adams once celebrated Durant’s own   too early. ” ’ ’ ”   LeBron James wasn’t successful at it, either. ” ’ ’ ’   For the finale, we turn it over to former Warriors center Andrew   Bogut for a lesson in this celebration. ’ ’ ’ ”   Perhaps the biggest takeaway from all of this is that it’s much   easier to pull of this celebration when you get to kick the ball   out to Stephen Curry. Durant will have that chance this season. ”
