’  ’ ’  ’ ’     Customers are becoming more involved in the manufacturing     process.   ’ ’     Tesla, the electric car maker, serves as . Buyers     can customize their entire car online, on their own. They can     choose the number of batteries and seats, add air filtration,     smart air suspension, sound systems, towing gear  —   all in the     space of five minutes. Then, a couple of weeks later, the     bespoke car is delivered.   ’ ’     It’s not just the   assembly lines that are being brought     into question, or the traditional dealerships that are being     challenged. Decades of   and       paradigms are being altered. If it wasn’t for what we call     “smart manufacturing” systems, with their collaborative     hardware and software bots and   this level of     customization would still be in the realm of science fiction.   ’ ’     The development of smart and flexible manufacturing is an     essential part of the . When an era is marked by a     version number all of its own, you know something major is     afoot. You know that it will change the world in the same way     that steam, electricity and information technology have done.   ’ ’       For the past decade, the manufacturing industry has brought       down its costs by working with partners in   regions.       Electronics industries look to China, textiles and clothing       businesses to Mexico or Honduras, shoes to Vietnam, and so       on. But smart manufacturing is about to reverse that. With       digital systems and data science, automation and adaptive       processes, smart manufacturing is being used to move       production closer to the markets that originate the demand.       This is in addition to accurately identifying what those       customers want, and tailoring products meant just for them.     ’ ’       One of the key technologies driving this is the internet of       things. This  offers       dynamic new ways to sense demand, reconfigure supply chains       and   manufacturing processes. And it can do this       with information flow in real time, and across the value       chain, blurring the boundaries between demand, design,       manufacturing and supply.     ’ ’       Admittedly, the concepts behind the internet of things are       still relatively new. But the starting point for smart       manufacturing is easy to identify: it begins when production       and manufacturing plants are brought online. But how do we do       this?     ’ ’       By focusing on these four key areas, for a start:     ’ ’       Until now, manufacturing equipment has had sensors that are       rudimentary by comparison to today’s standards. Much of the       existing manufacturing assets need to be retrofitted with       intelligent sensors that record data and also transmit it in       real time to central systems for alerts, analytics and        . Many of these sensors will also be required       to carry out the first level of analytics  —   for example,       deciding what data to send in real time and what to hold off       on. Advanced sensors will also have the ability to inspect       equipment automatically and troubleshoot without forcing       production lines to a grinding halt.     ’ ’       A number of disparate networks will come into play to enable       the internet of things, which forms the bedrock of smart       manufacturing. Current network standards and protocols will       have to be understood, and sensors made compatible and       flexible, to enable seamless          communication. Standardizing modes of communication between       equipment, their operators and   applications will       become a major area of focus for manufacturing. How these       issues are handled will determine the speed and efficiency of       the new manufacturing processes.     ’ ’       This is an area of concern that goes beyond smart       manufacturing to everything and everybody that is part of the       internet of things. But network, application and data       security is a relatively new and unique concern for       manufacturing that has, so far, had to contend more with       security and surveillance of a physical nature (theft,       sabotage, leaks). No connected system is safe from       cyberattack, and production plants with robots and other       connected equipment can become targets for hackers, and pose       a risk for production, business reputations and bottom lines.     ’ ’       No real change can occur without examining plant design and       optimizing it for   processes. The good news is       that current technologies make it easy to create virtual       plant designs, validate them through simulations and then       commission them. This could, in the long run, create more       flexible plants, by reducing building and maintenance costs,       improving safety, lowering emission standards and reducing         requirements.     ’ ’       The question is: what is it going to cost to do all of this?       In theory it looks effective and smart. But in practice the       investments required may be beyond most budgets. Think about       it this way: if smart manufacturing can show a   percent       improvement (translating to $2. 5 million savings) a year, and       contribute to business growth by appealing to more customers,       surely it is worth investigating.     ’ ’ This piece first appeared in World Economic Forum’s       . ’ ’ Saksham Khandelwal leads Wipro Ltd. ’s Strategic       Marketing  —   Innovation and Thought Leadership team.
