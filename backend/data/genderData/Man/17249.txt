Since the 1940s, the University of Nebraska has celebrated its football team’s first score of the game by releasing a large amount of red balloons.  Now, an activist in Omaha, NE wants the tradition banned, according to a Fox News report. Randall Krause filed a lawsuit last week alleging that the balloon release is in violation of the 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which prohibits the open dumping of solid waste. The Wall Street Journal released the statement from University of Nebraska spokesman Steve Smith that says the school does not comment on pending legislation. “It is, however, worth noting that every balloon released in Memorial Stadium is natural latex biodegradable, and they are tied off with 100% cotton strings,” Smith said in the statement.
