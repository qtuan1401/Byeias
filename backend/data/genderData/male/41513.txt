 (CNN) You’re only as old as you think you are. Or in this case, as old as a computer algorithm thinks you are. In a machine learning experiment that’s taken social vanity to new heights, Microsoft has created a website that tells you how old you look just by analyzing your photo. Sometimes it’s dead on. Other times it’s hilariously, outrageously wrong. It’s simple: Upload a selfie, wait a few seconds    then the machine gives you a number. And since it can analyze anyone’s photo, you can compare yourself to your friends, family, and foes. But guessing someone’s age is a dangerous game, even for a robot. That’s probably why the site comes with a sheepish apology. ”Sorry if we didn’t quite get the age and gender right,” it says after each result.  The company unveiled the website at a conference in late April as a way to show off its new software. Part of a new initiative called Project Oxford, Microsoft says you could use this face detection technology for tasks like sorting through a large photo collection. But we’re human    so we’ll probably just use it to judge our own looks. And everyone else’s.
