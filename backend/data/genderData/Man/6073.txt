A    black man whose fatal shooting by the police in September prompted days of   protests in Charlotte, N. C. died from gunshot wounds to the back and the abdomen, according to an autopsy performed at the request of his family. The results, released on Wednesday, show that the man, Keith Lamont Scott, was shot three times: in the back, the abdomen and the wrist. The Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner’s Office has not yet released the results of its own autopsy. “The Scott family authorized this release of information because, as they have maintained from the very beginning, they are simply seeking transparency,” Charles G. Monnett, a lawyer for the family, said in a statement. “We will continue to pursue justice for this family. ” The autopsy was performed on Sept. 30, at the Newberry County Memorial Hospital morgue by Newberry Pathology Associates. Mr. Scott was in a sport utility vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex on Sept. 20 when police officers, there to serve a warrant on someone else, confronted him. He was rolling a marijuana cigarette and held a gun up, the police said. His family has disputed that Mr. Scott was armed. Officer Brentley Vinson, who is also black, fatally shot Mr. Scott, whose actions he perceived as threatening, the police have said. In   obscured footage of the shooting, released by the   Police Department, Mr. Scott did not appear threatening, although officers can be heard at one point shouting, “Drop the gun!” His right hand appeared empty, but it was unclear if he was holding anything in the other hand. The shooting immediately drew protests, which lasted for several days. On the second night, one protester was fatally shot.
