 (CNN) While Noah and Emma were the most popular U. S. baby names of 2014, Oliver and Amelia were the most popular baby names across the pond in England and Wales for the second year in a row. Olivia, Isla and Emily were among the most popular girls names, while Jack, Harry and Jacob were among the most popular boys’ names, the BBC reported.  British parents who are fans of the television show ”Game Of Thrones” have also been inspired to name their children Arya, Khaleesi and Tyrion after characters in the show. The 2011 birth of Harper Beckham, the daughter of David and Victoria Beckham, has increased the popularity of her name.  In the United States, Biblical Noah held onto the top boy spot for a second year in a row, while Emma returned to the top girl spot for the first time since 2008.  The classic name James, which rose to the top in the 1940s and 1950s, made a return to the U. S. list in ninth place.  Predating the birth of the new Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana on May 2, 2015, the name Charlotte appeared on the U. S. top 10 list for the first time ever in tenth place. Expect Charlotte to attract a few more American fans this year. (Elizabeth was in 14th place, and Diana in 297th place). U. S. girls         1. Emma2. Olivia3. Sophia4. Isabella5. Ava6. Mia7. Emily8.

Parents in England and Wales can review the 2014 report and previous years at the Office of National Statistics site.  You might wonder how the U. S. government knows such things about your newborns. That’s because many U. S. parents file for a Social Security number with the federal government about the same time that they’re filing for their baby’s birth certificate with their local government.  Social Security gave birth to a baby, too: an interactive blog where people can ask questions about retirement, survivors, disability, and Medicare benefits.
