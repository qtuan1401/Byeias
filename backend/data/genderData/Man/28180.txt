Hillary Clinton dropped into a bar with her entourage and found herself crashing a bachelor party, a situation that turned into a photo op for the Democratic candidate for president. [Joe Schreck and his groomsmen were having a round of Bloody Marys to celebrate his upcoming wedding when Clinton and her campaign staff descended on Saffron, a café and bar in Charleston, South Carolina, reports the Washington Post.  “I love having men at my feet,” Clinton said, as her personal photographer, Barb Kinney, suggested some of the groomsmen kneel around Clinton for a photo. “This is exciting,” Clinton added. “That looks like a really good Bloody Mary. ” Schreck  —   who says he is a big fan of Clinton’s but is still undecided about whom he will vote for in the primary  —   invited Clinton to his wedding, but she declined.
