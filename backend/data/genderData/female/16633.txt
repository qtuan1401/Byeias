Wednesday at the White House Nowruz celebration for the Iranian New Year, first lady Michelle Obama said diversity is important “right now” at a time of  “disturbing and hateful rhetoric. ”  Obama said, “This is the people’s house. Yes. So enjoy. As Barack says, ‘just don’t break anything.’ That’s why when Barack and I first got here, we committed to opening this place up to as many people from as many different backgrounds as possible. Especially folks who have never been through these doors before. And that is particularity true for so many of the young people we bring into this house who would have never thought they would walk into the White House and have a place to call their own. We think America is strongest when we recognize our many traditions, when we celebrate our diversity and we lift each other up. And in times like these when we think of all that’s  —   that’s most important than ever before right now today with what’s going on. Right now when we are hearing so much disturbing and hateful rhetoric, it is so important to remember that our diversity has been and will always be our greatest source of strength and pride here in the United States. We are a nation of immigrants and we should cherish the talent and energy and the beautiful traditions and cultures that come with that heritage. ”
