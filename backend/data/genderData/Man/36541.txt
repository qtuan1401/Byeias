New York (CNN) And now he takes over the DNC. After a week at the Republican National Convention, ”Late Show” host Stephen Colbert emerged in Philadelphia on Sunday clad as ”Hunger Games” announcer Caesar Flickerman, just like how he marked his stay in Cleveland. In a blue wig and garish blue eyebrows, Colbert roamed around the floor of Wells Fargo Center engaging passersby, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.  CNN’s John Nowak tailed Colbert on his first day in Philadelphia. ”The first thing Colbert did was comment on the fact that big banks are an issue, and we’re here at the Wells Fargo Center,” Nowak said. Colbert’s political commentary pervaded every aspect of his act. Clutching a stuffed   animal, he waved a phone in front of it and said, ”All right, hit the scent . .. Scent!” He then threw it across the floor, saying, ”Go find the emails, go, go!” Nowak said, ”He put credentials on the stuffed weasel he was carrying around. You can tell he puts everything into the act. When someone looked over, he just stroked it like a weird pet. I think he called it Caligula.” ”What’s fun to watch is that he’s so in character and so funny. He goes through different jokes, tries different stuff.” But as soon as they did a cut, Colbert stepped out of character and talked to the producers and camera people to make sure the joke worked.
