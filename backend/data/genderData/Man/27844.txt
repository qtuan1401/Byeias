Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with President Bill Clinton on a private plane. [A source tipped off the local ABC affiliate about the brief meeting, which reportedly lasted about 30 minutes, at the Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International Airport.  President Clinton reportedly learned Lynch was arriving soon and waited to meet with her. According to ABC 15, the meeting occurred hours before the House Select Committee on Benghazi released its final report to the public. The private meeting comes as Lynch’s Justice Department is investigating presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal, private email server during her time as Secretary of State. “Lynch said the private meeting on the tarmac did not involve these topics,” ABC 15 reports. “I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving and spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,” Lynch stated, confirming the meeting. “Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix. ” “There was no discussion on any matter pending before the Department or any matter pending with any other body, there was no discussion of Benghazi, no discussion of State Department emails, by way of example I would say it was current news of the day, the Brexit decision and what it would mean,” Lynch said about the meeting.
