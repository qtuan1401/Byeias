Rep. Peter King ( ) spoke Sunday on New York AM 970’s “The Cats Roundtable” on the topic of the Syrian refugee crisis.  King told host John Catsimatidis that President Barack Obama’s plan to allow 100, 000 Syrian refugees into the U. S. could be dangerous for the country. “There is no way that we can be assured that the refugees coming from Syria are not ISIS terrorists,” he said. King stated Belgium was “not equipped” to handle the recent terrorist attack in Brussels, adding that the attack should be “a wake up call” for Europe. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
