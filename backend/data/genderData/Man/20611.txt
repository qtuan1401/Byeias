On Monday morning an armed clerk thwarted a robbery at the “Obama gas station”  —   a gas station renamed in honor of President Barack Obama  —   in Richland County, South Carolina. [The incident occurred around 3:30 a. m.  According to Live5News, Richland County Sheriff’s Department says a clerk called them after a man allegedly approached the counter and “flashed a weapon. ” The clerk says he responded by pulling his own gun, thereby causing the suspect to flee. Lt. Curtis Wilson says the clerk did not shoot but “the [suspect] fired shots while running away. ” No one was hit by the suspect’s gunfire and the suspect was not able to take anything. The gas station was named after President Obama in 2011, after owner Sam Alhanik “got the idea from a friend who created an Obama Gas Station in Michigan. ” Alhanik is originally from Yemen and told Live5News that Obama is “the first president of black people. ” “It’s our president. We like him,” he said. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
