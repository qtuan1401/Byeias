’  ’ ”   Costco’s   swap had . Now Citi   says the transitional struggles are coming to a close. ” ’   On Friday, Citi executives addressed the problems Costco members   faced in June when the firm became the exclusive issuer of Costco     credit cards, with the budget retailer switching from   American Express to  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”We’’re working through that,” CEO Michael Corbat  after  ”We’’re gaining on it. We’’re very   focused on it. We’’ve got a lot of resources deployed against it,   and it’’s something we can fix in the short order.” ’ ’   According to Corbat, Citi faced ”extremely high calling volumes”   from customers with questions about card activation, statements,   and payments. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”It’’s got to be one of the largest     transfers on a single day that’’s ever been attempted,” said Citi   CFO John Gerspach. ”That’’s not to give us excuses   …     But again,   it’’s a massive program.” ’ ’   Citi’s inability to respond to customer questions was one of the   biggest problems in the Costco   transition in late   June, with members facing long wait times and dropped calls while   waiting to speak with Citi   representatives. ’ ’   ”Worst credit card transition ever  —   4 hours and counting on the   phone with Citibank and they still can’’t get my cards to me,” one   Costco member . ”Saving money isn’’t worth alienating your   members . .. seriously rethinking my patronage.” ’ ’   Other issues included customers  ’ ’   Now Citi says wait times are decreasing. With customers more   easily able to talk with representatives, other problems are   being addressed and resolved. ’ ’   Despite the complaints, the company says the swap has been an   overall success. ’ ’   Citi reported more than 337, 000 new account acquisitions to date   since the switch  —   a number that significantly exceeded Citi’s   expectations. Purchase sales on Costco Visa   cards   totaled $5. 7 billion in the three and a half weeks following the   transition. ’
