Twitter has finally responded to its users. After months of fighting against Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and his authoritarian droogs, we the people have received what we’ve been waiting for  …     confetti animations that pop up out of the   button when you like a tweet! [It’s the social network’s second button change within the past few months, after Twitter replaced their previous “favourite” star buttons with the red   “like” buttons we have today.  Just noticed the new animation on @twitter like button. Like a mini celebration every click #littlebigdetails #ui pic. twitter.   —   Every Interaction (@EveryInteract) March 21, 2016,  The feature was added during Twitter’s 10th Anniversary celebration on Monday, where the social network also launched the hashtag #LoveTwitter to encourage users to post about what they love about the site. The social network’s celebration was not taken so well by some, however. In an age of social media censorship and a clampdown on free speech which has seen Twitter shadow ban conservatives and create a “Safety Council” to carefully monitor and police its users, some decided to use the celebration to fight back. Users took the opportunity to list the problems that exist on the platform, including Dorsey’s reluctance to be straight with his userbase and tell the truth, highlighting Twitter’s lack of urgency to deal with these problems if confetti animations were at the top of the drawing board. A #HateTwitter hashtag was also formed, with people using it to display their dissatisfaction of the platform. #LoveTwitter #HateTwitter pic. twitter.   —     Rolfe (@RolfeIt) March 20, 2016,  #HateTwitter because all they do is censor and ban conservatives but at the same time, we don’t have many other options than this crap.  —   Casey Ryan (@Frozensword14) March 20, 2016,  why are idiots like #lovetwitter people should be using #hatetwitter,  —   Itachi Uchiha (@Itachi2745) March 21, 2016,  Oh wait so @twitter is doing algorithms too?  Then forget the #lovetwitter —   I’m going to #hatetwitter  —   Is there any other good platforms?  —   Kellee Riley (@KelleeArt) March 21, 2016,  I #HateTwitter   It’s evident when hashtags go missing   lists  @ addresses stop  . @LindaSuhler @Nero,  —   #WTFook (@SnafuWorld) March 21, 2016,  Instead of #LoveTwitter let’s have #HateTwitter,  —   Bad Accounts (@BadTwitAccounts) March 21, 2016,  I’m enjoying @twitter’s new Like button animation of a bleeding heart blowing up the company, it’s a great homage to @jack. $TWTR,  —   Pax Dickinson (@paxdickinson) March 21, 2016,  Last week, Twitter made their new   algorithm default on every account, meaning that the “best tweets” were now displayed at the top of users’ feeds instead of the usual   list. This prompted further outrage from users, particularly after Dorsey had previously promised that no such move would take place. It’s somewhat worrying that with Twitter’s stock price falling by the day, and account numbers declining, Twitter has decided to throw this smokescreen of a celebration instead of dealing with the problem’s that they face at hand. Their users are leaving, and they need to do something about it. Charlie Nash is a frequent contributor to Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.
