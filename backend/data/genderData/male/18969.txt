On February 26, President Obama cited the Kansas shootings during a speech in Jacksonville, Florida, and pledged to keep pushing Congress to pass more gun control. [He did not mention that alleged Kansas gunman Cedric Ford was a felon who was completely barred from purchasing guns or possessing them. Ford faced 100 percent gun control.  Obama also pointed to the February 20 shootings in Kalamazoo, but was mum on the fact that the alleged gunman, Jason Brian Dalton, used a gun he had “registered” and which he owned “legally. ” Ford and Dalton, coming from opposite ends of the legal spectrum, actually prove the futility of added gun control. Yet a pledge for more gun control is exactly what Obama delivered. According to CBS News: “These acts may not dominate the news today, but these are two more communities in America that are torn apart by grief,” he said. “And I felt it was important for me to say something today because somehow —  as I’ve said before —  this becomes routine, these sort of mass shootings that are taking place. ” President Obama added, “Right now this Congress may not have the appetite to do something about it, but we need one that does,” then vowed, “As long as I hold this office, I’m going to keep bringing this up. Even if it’s not getting the same attention that it should. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
