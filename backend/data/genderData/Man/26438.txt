GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) called fellow GOP candidate Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) “the Republican Obama” in a campaign ad. [The television ad, airing in Iowa, states, “Tax hikes, amnesty, the Republican Obama  —   that’s Marco Rubio. ”  “[He is] the Republican Obama who championed Obama’s amnesty and led the ‘Gang of Eight,’” the ad says, referencing Rubio’s failed Gang of Eight immigration bill. Rubio’s campaign responded to the ad in a statement to The Hill: “Instead of campaigning on his record, Senator Cruz is pumping millions into negative and false attack ads days before the caucus because he knows Marco is gaining momentum,” said spokesman Joe Pounder. “Considering that he stood with Barack Obama just months ago to weaken our intelligence programs, this ad is another in a litany of examples of Ted Cruz desperately saying or doing anything to try to win an election. ” The ad comes just three days before the Iowa caucus.
