Families of   victims say it “is a slap in the face” for President Obama to lobby against a bill that would hold the Saudi government responsible for aiding and abetting the jihadists who carried out the terror attack in 2001. [From the New York Daily News:  Outraged   families accused Saudi Arabian officials Saturday of blackmailing the U. S. to hide their alleged role as financiers of the World Trade Center terrorists. The fierce attacks came after a Saturday report that the Saudis threatened to sell off up to $750 billion in U. S. assets if Congress passes legislation allowing its government to be held liable in    lawsuits. Families who lost loved ones in the terror attacks say President Obama, who is lobbying intensively to derail the bill, according to The New York Times, is on the wrong side of the issue. “I’m furious. This is a slap in the face to the   families,” said Jim Riches, the retired FDNY deputy chief whose firefighter son Jimmy died in the Trade Center rubble. “Let them keep their money. We don’t want their money. It’s not worth 3, 000 American lives. Call their bluff. ” Riches slammed Obama, five months shy of the 15th anniversary of the attacks. “How in his right conscience can he do this?” Riches asked. “Meanwhile, they slap us in the face. Stand up for our principles. ” Read the rest of the story here.
