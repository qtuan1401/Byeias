 (CNN) The Pokemon Go craze came to the State Department on Thursday, when a reporter was called out for playing the popular game during a briefing.  ”You’re playing the Pokemon thing right there, aren’t you,” State Department spokesman John Kirby asked a reporter during the daily briefing. Kirby had been in the middle of discussing ongoing efforts by the   coalition to fight the terror group.  The reporter, who hasn’t been identified, responded, ”I’m just keeping an eye on it.” RELATED: Pokemon GO consumes everything, including politics, Kirby resumed talking about the coalition    saying the fight ”won’t be easy” and the department is ”  about the work” it has to do.  Then he circled back to the Pokemon Go playing reporter, asking him, ”Did you get one?” The reporter responded that he did not, because ”the signal’s not very good.” Kirby said, ”I’m sorry about that” before continuing the briefing.
