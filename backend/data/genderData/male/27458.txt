Fox Searchlight released the latest promotional poster for its upcoming slave drama The Birth of a Nation on Friday that features the movie’s main character, slave rebellion leader Nat Turner (as played by Nate Parker) being hung with a noose fashioned from an American flag.  The Birth of a Nation  —   which stole the show at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, winning both the audience and grand jury prize awards   —   revolves around the 1831 slave rebellion engineered by Nat Turner in the antebellum South. Fox Searchlight snatched up the film at Sundance for a festival record $17. 5 million, and the film is already widely considered to be the frontrunner for Best Picture at next year’s Academy Awards. The latest poster was released Friday on  ’s Tidal streaming service. In addition to starring as Turner, Parker also wrote and directed the film. The first trailer for The Birth of a Nation was released online last month. The film is due out in theaters October 7.    Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum,
