’’ ”Moments ago, the People’s Bank of China, or PBOC, announced its Tuesday fixing level for the yuan  —   and it’s weaker again.” ”The   rate was set at 6. 5169, higher than Monday’s fix of 6. 5032 but below yesterday’s closing level of 6. 5338. Trade in the currency will resume shortly at 12:30 p. m. AEDT.” ’A higher figure indicates that the US dollar has strengthened against the Chinese currency.’ ’Unlike the reaction seen yesterday, markets have taken the weakening in their stride. Risk assets have moved marginally higher on the news, indicating relief that the fix was not as high as the previous closing level.’ ”Ever since the renminbi was first admitted to the IMF’s special drawing rights basket (SDR) in early December 2015, it has been nothing but   traffic for the currency. Day after day it has been weakening, heightening fears that capital continues to flee the country in search of greater returns, and safety, abroad.” ’The   chart below tells the story:’ ’Trade in Chinese markets will resume at 12:30 p. m. AEDT.’
