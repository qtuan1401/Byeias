 (CNN) Leonard Nimoy was beloved by geeks, including the character of Sheldon Cooper on the hit CBS show ”The Big Bang Theory.” The series paid tribute Thursday night to the ”Star Trek” star, who died Friday at the age of 83.  At the end of the episode, a picture of Nimoy appeared, with the caption ”The impact you had on our show and on our lives is everlasting.” The character of Cooper, played by   actor Jim Parsons, is obsessed with Nimoy and his Mr. Spock character. The show even featured the game ”Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.”  Nimoy never appeared physically on the show but did provide the voice for a Mr. Spock action figure in a dream sequence.
