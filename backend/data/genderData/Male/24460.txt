The Seattle Mariners came back from a   deficit to shock the San Diego Padres at home Thursday night. [“I knew going in if I could hold ’em to 12,” Mariners starter Wad Miley quipped after the game, “we had a chance. ”  Down   in the sixth, the Mariners went to work. Kyle Saeger hit a   double in the inning before Dae Ho Lee belted a   homer to cut the lead in half. In the seventh, the Padres chipped away in workmanlike fashion by unleashing eight runs on seven singles with two outs in the inning. They took a   lead after trailing by ten the previous inning. The Padres added a run in the bottom of the seventh. That’s where the scoring stopped, giving Seattle an improbable   road win. “You don’t see that very often, all the   singles, seven in a row?” Saeger told reporters. “That doesn’t happen. That was just an unbelievable experience and something I’ve never been a part of. ”
