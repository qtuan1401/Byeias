Minding was last of the five runners coming into the home Stretch but surged ahead of the field to finish a length ahead of Queen’s Trust in second and Jemayel in third. ”It was always going to be a messy sort of race,” Moore later said in comments carried by the UK’s Press Association news agency. ”I just tried to keep it as simple as I could. She was only doing what she had to do. ”She’s run in seven Group ones in a row and has won six   she is a very special filly,” he added. Minding’s trainer Aidan O’Brien was equally delighted with the performance. ”We’ve been very happy with her at home and she’s thrived from race to race,” O’Brien said.  ”Physically, she’s getting stronger, and she has a super mind. She loves racing. ”It can get messy in those small fields, but Ryan handled it great. He said she did what she had to do and has become very professional,” O’Brien added.
