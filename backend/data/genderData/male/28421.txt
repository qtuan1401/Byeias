An armed grandma who confronted three suspects in her home said, “I decided that it’s either them or me. ”[The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon in Boynton Beach, Florida.  According to CBS 12, a suspect began “banging” on the grandma’s door and ringing her doorbell around 12:45 pm. Through the peephole she saw the suspect leave and return with “a   over his head” and she noticed he was “putting on gloves. ” The grandma immediately moved toward her bedroom to retrieve her handgun and, as she did, the sound of breaking glass filled the house. She said, “It was really scary,” and added, “I decided that it’s either them or me, you know. I had to save my life. ” The grandma stood inside her bedroom with the gun raised and trained on the doorway. She said it wasn’t long until “one of them came to the door here and opened it and when he did I had the gun in his face. ” She said the looks on the faces of all three suspects convinced her they never dreamed a grandma would have a gun. “I called them bastards and I said I’m gonna kill you! All three of them started running for the door. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
