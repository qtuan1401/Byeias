Melissa   commented on the 2016 primary race Saturday on her MSNBC show, saying the fact that there are only two Democratic candidates remaining at this point shows how “anemic” the party is.  “I would argue that for me, Thursday night, watching Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, already this early, we are in New Hampshire. and our party is so anemic, that we are down to two candidates, right? Say what you want to say about the mad house going on on the Republican side. They’ve got all kinds of folks that still want the Republican nomination. We have two folks who are advanced in age, who have been in government for a long time. ”   later added that it is “whiter than the Oscars” in the Democratic race.
