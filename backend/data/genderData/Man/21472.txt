A man revealed to be part of a conspiracy to murder a Texas judge and commit banking fraud is now reported to be on the loose in the Houston, Texas region. [Marcellus Antione Burgin, 26, of Cypress, Texas is reported to be at large and is “considered armed and dangerous” according to FBI comments provided to Breitbart Texas. Federal agents note that Burgin was last seen fleeing from an automobile crash into a wooded area on Richmond Avenue.  Burgin allegedly participated in a   conspiracy from 2012 to 2015 that used “skimmers” and cameras placed on ATM machines in Texas and Louisiana to drain unsuspecting customers’ bank accounts. Beginning in 2011, the group lifted credit card numbers from retailers to convert funds into gift cards to later fence purchased merchandise. A complicated plot of filing false income tax returns for refund checks to establish and draw upon accounts was also uncovered with bank employees found accepting bribes for their assistance. In November 2015, Burgin agreed to aid   Chimene Hamilton Onyeri in the attempted murder of Texas District Court Judge Julie Kocurek of Austin, whom the group feared would soon sentence their leader to prison. As Breitbart Texas reported at the time, Judge Kocurek sustained multiple injuries from gunshots and shrapnel in her driveway but later survived the attack. Federal and state police are urging residents of the Houston area to be cautiously alert for Burgin. Crime Stoppers Houston is currently offering up to $5, 000 for information leading to an arrest (  ) and the FBI San Antonio Field Office is seeking information as well (  ).
