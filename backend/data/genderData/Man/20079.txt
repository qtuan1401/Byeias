Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that fellow candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) “is the only person” that “would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment” during Thursday’s Democratic candidates debate on MSNBC.  Hillary said, “Senator Sanders is the only person who, I think, would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment. And I’ve got to tell you that it is really quite amusing to me. People support me because they know me. They know my life’s work. They have worked with me, and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day, they endorse me because they know I can get things done. I am not going to make promises I can’t keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like   and then not level with people about how much it will cost. A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year. I’m not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes, and not your taxes, and not mean it. Because I don’t want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises, that would raise taxes, and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
