At a campaign rally held last week at the MorningStar Fellowship Church in Fort Mill, South Carolina, for GOP presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) radio talk show host Glenn Beck begged those in attendance to support Cruz’s campaign.  “I am telling you right now, this is your last call, America,” Beck proclaimed. “This is your last call. ” A video compilation created by the People for the American Way’s RightWingWatch. org shows Beck imploring attendees to seek God and ask Him who they should vote for in the forthcoming presidential elections. “I’m here as a citizen, as a fellow citizen,” Beck said. “And I’m begging you, please do not dismiss the peril we are in. Do not dismiss. Fall to your knees and pray to God to reveal to you what the hour is. Ask the dear Lord, our dear Lord, to show you who the man is that has the integrity, who has the connection, who will fall to his knees at the Resolute Desk, who, before he acts, doesn’t think of a poll but looks to the Constitution and the Holy Scriptures  —   our Bible and the Constitution both come from God they are both sacred scriptures. ” Beck closed his speech by lobbying for those to go beyond voting and actively campaign for a candidate, which he declared to be Cruz. “I know there is a God,” he said. “I testify to you that I see a storm coming. And God does have a place for each and every one of us. It is your job now to be able to sleep at night to go door to door, to talk to every person you know, to find the candidate that will stand where God is telling him to stand in an unshakeable way. Get your family to vote, friends to vote. You cannot stand on the sideline. It is not enough for you to just go out and vote. You must be an evangelist for the Constitution of the United States. This is your last call, America. Stand, stand, stand for the man I believe was raised for this hour: Ted Cruz. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
