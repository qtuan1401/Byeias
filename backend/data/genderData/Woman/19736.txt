While campaigning for her son in New Hampshire, Barbara Bush said she thinks Jeb Bush is “too polite. ”[“I love my son and I know that America needs him,” Barbara Bush told CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell. “He’s honest, dependable, loyal, relatively funny! Good looking, but funny. ”  “He’s got the same values that America seems to have lost.   …     He’s almost too polite,” she added. “I don’t advise him, but if I gave him advice: I would say, ‘Why don’t you interrupt like the other people do? ’” “I’ve gotten better at interrupting, mom, come on,” Jeb Bush responded to his mother’s statement. “You mean interrupt during the debates?” O’Donnell asked. “Yes. He’s so polite. We brought him up that way,” Mrs. Bush replied. “And he does not brag like some people we know. ” “Who are you talking about?” O’Donnell asked. “I can’t remember,” Mrs. Bush said. “You can say it,” Jeb Bush said, chuckling.
