McAllen, Texas  â€”   More than 200 illegal aliens have been stuffed in car trunks, sealed into tractor trailers by human smugglers, or placed in danger through other tactics this fiscal year as they attempt to get around inspection checkpoints. The period of time is from October 1, 2015 through today. [Since the start of the 2016 fiscal year (October 1) U. S. Border Patrol agents have rescued illegal aliens from dangerous smuggling attempts, information provided to Breitbart Texas by the agency revealed.   Once human smugglers get aliens over the Rio Grande, they tend to place them in stash houses until they are able to prepare their smuggling attempt in order to bypass the federal checkpoint located between 30 and 80 miles north of the river.
