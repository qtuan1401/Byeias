 (CNN) The Senate is likely to approve Loretta Lynch as the nation’s next attorney general in the next two or three days, an influential Republican said Sunday.  Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on ”State of the Union” that he expects a deal to quickly come together this week to clear both Lynch and an   trafficking law that Democrats have blocked due to an   provision.

His comments come after Obama called the delay over a vote on Lynch ”embarrassing.”  ”Enough. Enough. Call Loretta Lynch for a vote, get her confirmed, let her do her job. This is embarrassing,” Obama told reporters during a joint White House press conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,   has held up Lynch’s nomination as leverage to get Democrats to drop their filibuster against the   trafficking bill. A McConnell spokesman said as soon as that bill advances, Lynch will get a vote.  ”There are times where the dysfunction in the Senate just goes too far,” Obama said. ”This is an example of it.” Lynch would be the country’s first   woman to hold the post. Her nomination has stalled longer than any attorney general pick since the Reagan administration.
