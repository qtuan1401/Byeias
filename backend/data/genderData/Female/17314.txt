A Michigan woman is facing threats of fines from her townhome complex for hanging an American flag on her door. [Doris Fladzinkski hung the flag on her door at Kearsley Creek Townhomes and received a notice that she would be fined $25 per day for every day the flag remained up until she took it down.  “I pay to live here. The door, as far as I’m concerned, is my property until I step on the sidewalk,” Fladzinkski said to WNEM. “I don’t care what kind of flag you want to hang, as long as our flag is on top. ” Managers of the townhome complex told WNEM that restrictions are in the lease and that allowing one type of flag on one door would open a figurative door to potentially offensive displays.
