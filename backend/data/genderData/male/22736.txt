Citing security concerns, WikiLeaks has cancelled an   “October surprise” announcement by Julian Assange, which many have theorized will expose   information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. [WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange was scheduled to appear on the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Tuesday, where he has claimed asylum since 2012, to make the announcement. Assange will instead now appear via video livestream on Tuesday for a press conference to discuss “the past, present  future of WikiLeaks,” according to the group.  According to @wikileaks, Julian Assange will appear via video link at Berlin press conference on Tuesday AM,  —   Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) October 2, 2016,  WikiLeaks press conference 10:00 am Berlin time on the past, present  future of WikiLeaks #wikileaks10 https:  .   —   WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 3, 2016,  During the   to the 2016 presidential election, Assange has released thousands of documents and emails exposing numerous controversies surrounding Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. In July, a leak of over 19, 000 emails from the DNC showed that the party had actively worked against Bernie Sanders’ campaign for nomination, plotting tactics to give Clinton a favourable chance from the start. Further emails have since been released showing that Clinton took orders from George Soros as secretary of state, lied about her knowledge of Libyan arm exports, and had   meetings with a number of friendly news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal. In August, WikiLeaks offered a $20, 000 reward for information about murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich. Rich, who was shot and killed in July, was heavily hinted at by Assange to be the source of the DNC leaks. Since the cancellation of Assange’s balcony appearance, WikiLeaks have tweeted an old quote allegedly from Clinton on the editor, stating, “Can’t we just drone this guy?” Hillary Clinton on Assange ”Can’t we just drone this guy”   —   report https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 3, 2016,  Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
