Thursday at the CNN Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn, NY, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) squared off against his opponent Democratic   Hillary Clinton and questioned her judgement on the grounds of foreign policy, trade and campaign finance.  Sanders’ attack was in response to a Washington Post story in which the Clinton campaign suggested the Vermont senator was qualified to hold the land’s highest office. “Well, I’ve known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years? We worked together in the Senate. And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign. The Washington Post headline says “Clinton Campaign Says Sanders Is Unqualified,” and that’s what the surrogates were saying. Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president? Of course she does. But I do question her judgment. I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of   jobs. And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street. I don’t believe that that is the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
