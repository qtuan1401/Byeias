Hillary Clinton slammed the allegedly disparate   criminal justice policies established by her own husband. [“Well, sadly, it’s reality” that black male lives are cheap in America, Clinton claimed in the Democratic debate Sunday night in Charleston, South Carolina, that was hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.  Her husband, Bill Clinton, served as president from 1993 to January 2001. “There needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system,” Clinton said. Clinton said America should start “looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to bring the disparities that stalk our country into relief. ” “Very often the black men are arrested, convicted, and incarcerated” at higher rates than white men, she said. Clinton did not mention that her own husband Bill Clinton signed a bill in 1995 to preserve stricter criminal penalties on a federal level for crack cocaine violators than for powder cocaine, which were widely claimed to have had a greater impact on   criminals than on white criminals. Sanders pushed back for calling to “  our police departments so that they don’t look like occupying armies,” and for “police departments to look like their communities in terms of diversity. ”
