Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) chief, Charlie Beck, says police located a “kill list” in UCLA gunman Mainak Sarkar’s Minnesota home. [The name of the professor killed at UCLA was on the list, as “was the name of a woman whom police later found dead. ”  According to CNN, Beck said police searched for the woman after seeing her on the list and found her body in a residence in a “nearby town in Minnesota. ” She was “deceased by gunshot wound. ” Breitbart News previously reported that Sarkar allegedly shot and killed Klug in a   zone just before 10:00 a. m. on Wednesday, then turned the gun on himself, taking his own life. Sarkar claimed that Klug had stolen his computer code and given it to someone else. Chief Beck made clear that “UCLA says [the allegation] is absolutely not true. ” The school said Sarkar’s claims were “the workings of his imagination. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
