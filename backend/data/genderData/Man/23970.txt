From Washington Examiner’s Paul Bedard:[The national union that represents 7, 000 U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers claims that House Speaker Paul Ryan is playing a role in the national immigration crisis by not voicing strong support for law enforcement’s war on the administration’s   practices.  In a stinging letter to Ryan, the president of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council charged that Ryan’s legislative moves and rhetoric have led to more illegals entering the country with the belief they can stay. “I am sorry to say that your rhetoric could be adding to that perception. Children crossing our border are molested and perish. Any political leader who truly cares about these children will stop the rhetoric and begin working with law enforcement to develop sound immigration policy to end the crisis on our nation’s border,” wrote union president Chris Crane.
