Wednesday on 800 WVHU’s “The Tom Roten Morning Show,” in referencing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s medical incident causing her to nearly collapse when leaving the   memorial service in New York City early and the campaign later revealing Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia, Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said, “When they trotted out that diagnosis of pneumonia a couple days after the fact, America just didn’t buy it because they assume the Clintons will probably lie to you anyway. ”  Paul said, “I think it is troubling when we look at the reports from Clinton —  not just the potential health problems that she has —  but also the dissembling the dishonesty about it. And when they trotted out that diagnosis of pneumonia couple days after the fact, America just didn’t buy it because they assume the Clintons will probably lie to you anyway. And I think it is concerning really, even if you are her family member and you are very concerned about her health. Maybe they need to look deeper into finding an answer, because people with the pneumonia who are recovering from the pneumonia who are not febrile and sort of fluid don’t go out in 79 degree morning weather and faint. So you know there are a lot of other possibilities they need to look into, heart, neurological,   type syndromes on the brain. So there are a lot of things they need to look into with her health. I think it hurts her politically because she doesn’t appear to be forthcoming about it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
