In an interview that aired Friday during CNN’s “The Situation Room,” Gov. John Kasich ( ) a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, dismissed the suggestion he would be a good running mate instead of a presidential nominee.  Kasich told CNN’s Gloria Borger he would in fact be a worst vice president than current Vice President Joe Biden. “I would be the worst vice president anybody could ever imagine,” Kasich said. “I’d be worse than Biden. Because I’m my own man. I’m not going to take orders from these people. It’s not what I do, it’s not who I am. I’m basically an unrelenting agent of change. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
