REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  —   The ongoing hunt for the leader of the Gulf Cartel in this border city has led to more than nine days of continuous gun battles. The clashes resulted in the deaths of at least 14 individuals  —  including most of the gunmen. Anecdotal accounts by residents place the death toll much higher.   As Breitbart Texas reported, Mexican authorities have been targeting the leadership of the Gulf Cartel in this city. Officials focused their efforts on capturing or killing Gulf Cartel leader Julian “Comandante Toro” Loisa Salinas, also known as Juan Manuel Loisa Salinas.  Law enforcement officials consulted by Breitbart Texas point to El Toro possibly being forced out of Reynosa and turning control of the plaza to another Gulf Cartel commander. The ongoing violence has sparked rumors about a   curfew placed in the city where residents were asked to not be out on the city streets after a certain hour. Those rumors spread through social media as well as messaging applications raising the level of concern among citizens. Breitbart Texas reached out to Tamaulipas law enforcement officials who stated that government agencies at the local, state nor federal level implemented no such measure. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
