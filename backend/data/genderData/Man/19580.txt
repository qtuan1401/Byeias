Thursday on ESPN Radio’s “Dan Le Batard Show,” ESPN NFL draft guru Mel Kiper Jr. spoke with   Jon “Stugotz” Weiner about last week’s NFL combine and the upcoming NFL draft, much to the chagrin of Dan Le Batard.  Le Batard, who appeared bored during the Kiper interview, eventually got up and walked out of the studio. Kiper was asked if he would come back for the next segment and said only if Le Batard would ask him a question and “shows a little interest in what we do here. ” “Le Batard, what’s the deal, man?” Kiper asked.
