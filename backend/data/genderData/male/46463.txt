’’ ’The death of US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13 may have forced the high court to be more discerning about the cases it takes on.’ ’With an even number of justices presiding, as well as a fairly even ideological split, justices risk a split ruling on controversial cases.’ ”The court appears to be choosing cases carefully, in an attempt to avoid the appearance of being hamstrung by the vacancy caused by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death.” ’’ ’Although the court usually agrees to hear eight cases (for the next cycle) on average during the   period, this year it has agreed to hear just three, none of which appear to be particularly controversial.’ ’In fact, the court has agreed to hear just eight cases for the October 2016 to June 2017 session, as opposed to the 70 cases typically heard during a session.’ ’Although the Court may be hedging its bets for the future, its current caseload appears to be designed to show off the problems with an eight justice court.’ ”The court has come to a tied    decision twice since Justice Scalia’s death in February, and there are still more controversial cases on the docket.” ”Prior to Scalia’s death, it appeared that the court would rule   in a decision that had the power to shape the future of unions.

California Teachers Association unions case disappointed plaintiffs, who plan to file a rehearing petition. They hope the case will be heard when the court is back at full strength.’
