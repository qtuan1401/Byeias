’  ’ ’   What does Doug Haynes, president of Point72 Asset Management,   look for in young people wanting to work for him? ’ ’   In the  with Skiddy von Stade of OneWire,   Haynes explained what qualities he looks for when hiring college   students for the Point72 Academy. The academy  for the firm, and Point72   recently  to Europe and Asia. ’ ’   ”We like people who have demonstrated grit,” he said. ”Somebody   who has financed their own education, somebody who has had a       job of one kind or another.” ’ ’   Haynes is also interested in hiring graduates with different   experiences. ’ ’   ”We don’’t want to hire all finance backgrounds, nor do we want to   hire necessarily all   backgrounds,” Haynes said. ’ ’   Instead, Point72 looks to candidates who have ”a demonstrated   interest in the markets,” regardless of their background. ’ ’ ’ ’   Such diversity, Haynes believes, will add value to his firm. ’ ’   ”If everybody sees things the same way, you start to create a lot   of risk because all the thinking gets correlated, and when there   is a problem, you don’’t have the diversification of ideas and   perspectives that makes you aware of it,” he said. ’ ’   Point72, with headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, was  in 2014 and manages about $11 billion   in assets. Haynes joined the firm in 2014 as managing director of   human capital and later became president. ’ ’   To the graduating class of 2017, Haynes said following your   passion is not as important as creating opportunities to learn. ’ ’   ”A young person graduating from college may think that they know   what they want to do for the rest of their lives  —   I can   guarantee you it’’s not true,” he said. ”I strongly think you make   your first decision based on your opportunities to grow   personally and professionally and then have an open mind.” ’
