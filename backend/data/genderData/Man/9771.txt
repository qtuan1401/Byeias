On Tuesday’s “Good Morning America,”   George Stephanopoulos and ABC Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz stated that the attack in Manchester could lead to   backlash.  Stephanapolous said that while people are determined to go back to their normal lives, “this is also likely to inflame   sentiment across Britain, across Europe. ” Raddatz responded, “It sure could, George. You know, Manchester itself is a very multicultural city. There’s a large Muslim population, with many there for generations. So, a headscarf attracts little attention there. And notably, Manchester did not vote in favor of Brexit, but an attack like this, as you said, is much bigger than Manchester itself, and will likely create backlash depending, of course, on the details of this attack, George. ” (  WFB) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
