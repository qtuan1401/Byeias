CBC reports: A Montreal mosque is facing a police complaint and rebukes from the larger Muslim community after a video of an imam delivering a sermon in which he asks for Jews to be killed surfaced online. [The sermon took place at the Dar   Mosque in the city’s   neighbourhood on Dec. 23, 2016. The video was posted to the mosque’s YouTube channel three days later. The imam in the video is Jordanian cleric Sheikh Muhammad bin Musa Al Nasr  —   he was reportedly an invited guest of the mosque.  In the video, the imam recites in Arabic the verse: “O Muslim, O servant of Allah, O Muslim, O servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. ” CBC independently verified the speech and its translation. The controversial verse comes from a religious text known as a hadith, which interprets the words and actions by the Prophet Muhammad. The hadith in question deals with end times and tells how stones and trees will ask Muslims to come and kill Jews hiding behind them. Read more here.
