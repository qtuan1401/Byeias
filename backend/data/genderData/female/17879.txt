Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has spoken out against the government’s regulation of the Internet through net neutrality in a video message Breitbart Tech can exclusively share with readers. [When asked whether he supports more or less restrictions on the Internet, Bush answered, “No, I think we should probably repeal the FCC rule that creates a public utility for access to the Internet. ”  “Ultimately, it’s going to give too much government power to get to content,” he continued. “Which would be the death knell of the Internet. ” “You need to have an environment that is open so you have the kind of investment to increase broadband, to increase access, and creating a public utility by using a 1934 law is an unmitigated disaster,” Bush argued.  Bush joins fellow GOP presidential hopefuls Sen. Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina, Gov. Chris Christie, and Sen. Marco Rubio in speaking out against net neutrality in videos recorded for the nonprofit organization Protect Internet Freedom. Protect Internet Freedom, which boasts 1. 6 million members, told Breitbart Tech: “We believe a unanimous consensus on the importance of protecting real Internet freedom, unfettered by government interference, sends a powerful message that we won’t stand by and allow Washington to turn the vibrant empowering Internet into a neutered government agency. ” Jerri Ann Henry, Public Advocate for PIF, added: “I am so encouraged to see our candidates address this crucial issue. Protecting the First Amendment is one of the most important issues a president will face  —   it transcends almost every other issue. ” “The FCC’s heavy handed move to regulate the Internet threatens free speech and it is imperative we take steps to ensure future generations have the ability to speak freely and exercise rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution,” she stated.
