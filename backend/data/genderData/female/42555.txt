 (CNN) Oops, she did it again. Britney Spears and her beau of eight months, Charlie Ebersol, have reportedly split.  The singer has scrubbed pics of Ebersol from her Instagram account just weeks after fans were buzzing that she and the producer may have been heading down the aisle. Ebersol is the son of actress Susan St. James and NBC Sports Chairman Dick Ebersol. In March, Spears told People that Ebersol had a good relationship with her young sons, Sean Preston and Jayden James. ”They relate to him really well, and they have fun together,” she said. ”He’s refreshing to be around and really  .” Ebersol seemed equally smitten with the singer, who popped up on his social media accounts as well. Talk had already started heating up that Spears had moved on when she tweeted a picture of herself with    Harris Beall, accompanied by the caption ”So nice to be home! Nothing like Louisiana boys.” But Beall told ”Access Hollywood” that he and Spears had just met when he ran into her and her family at the Prop Stop in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, where he works. ”Later that day, I was walking down the dock, and Britney said, ’Can I take a picture with you?’ because she liked my shirt,” he said. ”Britney and I are not affiliated with each other at all.”
