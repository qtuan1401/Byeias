Major school exams across the UK have been moved to accommodate Islam and students who fast during the month of Ramadan, following new measures set in place by education authorities. [The GCSE and   schedule has been rearranged so that some exams in key subjects are clustered before the start of Islam’s month of fasting.  This year Ramadan is expected to fall in early June and the examination boards say they have met with Muslim groups and complied with their wishes to avoid scheduling exams in the most popular subjects during the period. “Where possible,   GCSE and GCE [ ] subjects are timetabled prior to the commencement of Ramadan and consideration is given to whether they are timetabled in the morning or afternoon,” said the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) which represents examination boards in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Anne Longfield, the government’s children’s commissioner for England, said she applauded the move when she appeared before parliament’s education committee at a hearing on Wednesday. She added that it is “important we understand the individual children in this. ” Plenty of other groups asked just why it was that the entire British education system should be changed to accommodate just one faith with followers that make up just 4. 8 per cent of the population.  Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said that her union had been campaigning on the issue of exams during Ramadan for more than a year. “As educators we want all children to be able to achieve their best in exams that are so crucial to their future,” she said. “We shall continue to raise awareness of best practice and how education staff can support students during Ramadan. ”
