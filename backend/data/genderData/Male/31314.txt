The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) shows two interesting facts about Omar Mateen, the man identified by law enforcement as the terrorist who shot up a gay nightclub in Orlando. [1. He possessed a “Security Officer” license in Florida. 2. He possessed a “Statewide Firearms License” in Florida. Radio host John Cardillo made this discovery, tweeting out a screenshot:  #Orlando terrorist had FL Security Officer and Firearms licenses. Was background checked.

And according to the FDACS website, an individual with a class “D,” “M,” or “MB” security license must also get a Statewide Firearms License (class “G”). The firearms license allows the security licensee to carry two guns on his person when performing security duties in the state. Background checks are required for both the Security Officer license and the Statewide Firearms License. Those checks include thorough criminal checks, too. Mateen would have had to pass such checks to acquire his licenses and possess firearms. Despite passing these background checks, Mateen shot and killed 50 individuals at the “Pulse” night club, which catered to gay customers. He wounded 53 victims, as well, before police killed him. A Democratic lawmaker on the House Intelligence Committee said that Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and Mateen’s father told reporters that his late son was enraged by the sight of two men kissing several months ago.
