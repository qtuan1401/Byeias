They’ve never interfered with anything I’ve said on radio,” he explained. “It’s a pleasure to be associated with them and the other great broadcast companies that carry my program. ” “The next decade will determine the fate of the nation. Will we live as a free and prosperous people, or will we succumb to a growing soft tyranny and lose what remains of our republic?” Levin asked. “These are perilous and daunting times. And I intend to continue to use my platform and other avenues to rally the people to defend the America heritage, which is their birthright. ” “And through it all, we will continue to be passionate, joyful, and fun loving because that’s also part of living and being Americans,” he stated.

Larry Solov, Breitbart News President and CEO, said of Levin: “Mark Levin fearlessly and passionately stands up for conservatives and everyday Americans whose voices the mainstream press often tries to marginalize or silence. And like Andrew Breitbart, Levin has a way of cutting through the mainstream press’s filter with his words and is never afraid to have arrows slung at him by the institutional left on the front lines of the fight. ”
