 (CNN) Here’s a look at controversial police encounters in the news. 1991   Los Angeles   Rodney KingMarch 3, 1991   LAPD officers beat motorist Rodney King after he leads police on a   chase through Los Angeles County. George Holliday videotapes the beating from his apartment balcony. The video shows police beating King more than 50 times with their batons. Over 20 officers are present at the scene, mostly from the LAPD. King suffers 11 fractures and other injuries. March 15, 1991   A Los Angeles grand jury indicts Sergeant Stacey Koon and Officers Laurence Michael Powell, Timothy Wind, and Theodore Briseno in connection with the beating. May 10, 1991   A grand jury refuses to indict 17 officers who stood by at the King beating and did nothing. April 29, 1992   The four LAPD officers are acquitted of beating King. Riots break out at the intersection of Florence and Normandie in South Central Los Angeles. Governor Pete Wilson declares a state of emergency and calls in the National Guard. Riots in the next few days leave more than 50 people dead and cause nearly $1 billion in property damage. May 1, 1992   Rodney King makes an emotional plea for calm, ”People, I just want to say, can we all get along? Can we get along? Can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids?” August 4, 1992   A federal grand jury returns indictments against Koon, Powell, Wind, and Briseno on the charge of violating Rodney King’s civil rights. April 17, 1993   Koon and Powell are convicted for violating King’s civil rights. Wind and Briseno are found not guilty. No disturbances follow the verdict. August 4, 1993   US District Court Judge John Davies sentences both Koon and Powell to 30 months in prison. Powell is found guilty of violating King’s constitutional right to be free from an arrest made with ”unreasonable force.” Koon, the ranking officer, is convicted of permitting the civil rights violation to occur. April 19, 1994   The federal court awards King $3. 8 million in compensatory damages in a civil lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles. King had demanded $56 million, or $1 million for every blow struck by the officers. June 1, 1994   In a civil trial against the police officers, a jury awards King $0 in punitive damages. He had asked for $15 million.  June 17, 2012   King is found dead in his swimming pool.  1992   Detroit   Malice Wayne GreenNovember 5, 1992   Two white police officers approach Malice Wayne Green, a    black motorist after he parks outside a suspected drug den.

Green dies of his injuries later that night.   November 16, 1992   Two officers, Larry Nevers and Walter Budzyn, are charged with   murder. Sgt. Freddie Douglas, a supervisor who arrived on the scene after a call for backup, is charged with involuntary manslaughter and willful neglect of duty. Another officer, Robert Lessnau is charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm. November 18, 1992   The Detroit Free Press reports that toxicology tests revealed alcohol and a small amount of cocaine in Green’s system. A medical examiner later states that Green’s head injuries, combined with the cocaine and alcohol in his system, led to his death.  December 1992   The Detroit police chief fires the four officers.  August 23, 1993   Nevers and Budzyn are convicted of murder after a   trial. Lessnau is acquitted. Nevers sentence is 12 to 25 years, while Budzyn’s sentence is eight to18 years. The charge against Douglas had been dismissed before the trial.       The Michigan Supreme Court orders a retrial for Budzyn due to possible jury bias. During the second trial, a jury convicts Budzyn of a less serious charge, involuntary manslaughter and he is released with time served.      A jury finds Nevers guilty of involuntary manslaughter after a second trial. He is released from prison in 2001. 2006   Nevers’ book about the incident and the trial, ”Good Cops, Bad Verdict: How Racial Politics Convicted Us of Murder” is published.  2013   The city demolishes a structure with a memorial for Green, a mural painted on the building near the street where the fatal confrontation took place. 1997   New York   Abner LouimaAugust 9, 1997   Abner Louima, a    Haitian immigrant, is arrested for interfering with officers trying to break up a fight in front of the Club   nightclub in Brooklyn.
