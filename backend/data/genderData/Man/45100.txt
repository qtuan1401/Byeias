’  ’ ”   The Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry is not paid like one of   the top players in the NBA. However, he has a great perspective   on that status, and it comes from his father, Dell Curry, a   former NBA player. ” ’   Stephen Curry, the   reigning NBA MVP, is in the final   year of a   $44 million extension he signed with the   Warriors in 2012. His salary this season  —   $12. 1 million  —      and fourth among his teammates. ’ ”   While the contract has been a steal for the Warriors,  at the time. Curry was a gifted shooter, but   he had been plagued with ankle injuries and hadn’t yet developed   into an   player. ” ’   In a recent interview with  Curry was asked how he dealt with playing with   lesser players who made a lot more money. Curry said he kept   things in perspective by leaning on some advice his father once   gave him. ’ ’   ”One thing my pops always told me is you never count another   man’’s money,” Curry told Kawakami. ”It’’s what you’’ve got and how   you take care of it. And if I’’m complaining about $44 million   over four years, then I’’ve got other issues in my life.” ’ ’’ ”   Curry added that when he signed the deal, he knew he was taking   less than other players but wasn’t going to regret the decision: ” ”   While Curry is making $12. 1 million at a time when Harrison   Barnes, his former teammate, is making nearly twice that ($22. 1   million) with the Dallas Mavericks, Curry’s situation could soon   be rectified. ” ’   If Curry   with the Warriors this summer, as expected, he   will be eligible for a   $207. 4 million contract,   . His salary next season would jump to $35. 7 million   and reach about $48 million in the final season. ’ ”   If that happens, you can be certain that other players will be   counting Curry’s money. ” ”The Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry is not. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
