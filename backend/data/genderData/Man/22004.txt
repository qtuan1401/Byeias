In an interview with The New York Times, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed that the media have “erected a demon” by protecting Hillary Clinton from criticism. [In an interview with journalist Jo Becker via Facebook, Assange claimed that the liberal media were doing their nation a disservice by refusing to cover Hillary Clinton’s less than pristine record.   “The American liberal press, in falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton, are erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone’s necks as soon as she wins the election, which is almost certainly what she’s going to do,” said Assange.  Becker questioned Assange’s own political leanings, asking whether or not his biases were affecting his objectivity. Assange replied that WikiLeaks’ “enormous range” was not highlighted by the media and that WikiLeaks had released over 10 million documents on multiple organisations across many countries, highlighting money laundering schemes and the “  mill” in Russia.  Assange has openly stated his distrust of Hillary Clinton in the past and released info relating to both Clinton and DNC corruption. He has also claimed that Silicon Valley tech companies such as Google are purposefully painting Clinton in a positive light and are “directly engaged” in Clinton’s presidential campaign. Assange denied that he was purposefully targeting Clinton, saying, “We don’t target the West. We are an investigative publisher. ”  “We also represent whistleblowers who want to speak to the public like a lawyer to the greatest court in the world, the court of public opinion. We don’t target anyone,” he stated. Assange has claimed that he has damning information relating to Clinton for an “October Surprise,” saying, “People have a right to understand who they are electing,”  Lucas Nolan is a conservative who regularly contributes articles on censorship and free speech to Breitbart.
