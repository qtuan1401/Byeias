Seventeen passengers aboard a ferry on the Hudson River were injured after it struck a dock in Jersey City on Saturday night, a city spokeswoman said. Three people were removed on stretchers and the rest were able to walk off the ferry, the Peter R. Weiss operated by New York Waterway, said the spokeswoman, Jennifer Morrill. All of the injuries were minor, she said. A spokesman for the Coast Guard, Petty Officer Third Class Steve Strohmaier, said the ferry hit the Paulus Hook dock at a “fast rate of speed” around 7:20 p. m. The ferry, with 57 people on board, was arriving from the World Financial Center in Manhattan when it struck the dock, said Pat Smith, a spokesman for New York Waterway. He described it as a “hard landing” and equated it to a jolt passengers get while the riding the subway. Accounts of the number of injured varied. Ms. Morrill, citing figures from the Jersey City Fire Department, said five passengers were taken to Christ Hospital and 12 to Jersey City Medical Center. Mr. Smith said crew members reported six people injured with bumps and bruises, and Petty Officer Strohmaier said 15 people were injured, with four of them seeking medical attention. Mr. Smith said the ferry, which has a capacity for 150 passengers, was not damaged. Petty Officer Strohmaier said the Coast Guard was investigating.
