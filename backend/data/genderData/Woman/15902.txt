On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Washington Post Reporter Chris Cillizza argued “the greatest thing that happened to the Republican Party is Barack Obama. ”[After agreeing with host and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough that the Democrats don’t have a bench, Cillizza said, “I always say that the greatest thing that happened to the Republican Party is Barack Obama. Yes, he spent eight years in the White House, but during those eight years they have made massive gains. I wrote last year, if you look at the full party, and this was assuming Barack Obama in the White House and maybe Hillary Clinton in the White House, the Republican Party, much healthier overall than the Democratic Party. ”  He added that Hillary Clinton’s “emergence as the sort of de facto nominee” almost eight years ago glossed over the fact that “they don’t have a lot of people underneath it. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
