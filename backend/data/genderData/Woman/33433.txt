 (CNN) We always knew Missy Elliott’s music would save lives one day, and this week, New York Presbyterian Hospital confirmed our suspicions.  In an effort to help train first responders in   CPR, the hospital dropped a   playlist   with artists from Beyonce to Lynyrd Skynyrd. The hospital site lists out all the CPR steps, but the key number to remember is 100 compressions per minute. That’s where the playlist comes in.  With every song bumping at the 100    benchmark, each works as a guide for timing compressions. Headlining the playlist is the most applicable song: ”Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees. However, if you want a song that’s less   the hospital also recommends ”Hips Don’t Lie” by Shakira and ”One Week” by Barenaked Ladies.  Although this playlist was created to help save lives, it could easily double as the perfect soundtrack for a middle school dance. So whether you’re saving someone in cardiac arrest or simply want to get through your workday, it’s time to throw on ”Dancing Queen” by ABBA and get that heart pumping.
