’  ’ ”   A Tokyo suburb will help women cover the cost of freezing their   eggs in a pilot program aimed at countering Japan’s declining   birth rate. ” ’   The city of Urayasu, about 14 kilometers (9 miles) east of Tokyo,   is allocating 90 million yen ($850, 000) over three years to fund   the research project conducted by Juntendo University Urayasu   Hospital. ’ ’   The hospital hopes that preserving eggs will encourage women to   give birth when they are ready instead of giving up having   children. ’ ’   Dr. Iwaho Kikuchi of the hospital said Thursday that using public   funds to support this kind of study may be a first in the world. ’ ’   The average cost of such procedure is around 500, 000 to 600, 000   yen ($4, 700 to $5, 700) but a woman will only pay 20 percent of   the cost with the subsidy. Women between the age of 25 and 34 who   live in Urayasu, also home to Tokyo Disneyland, are eligible to   participate. ’ ’’ ’   Kikuchi said 12 women are in the process of starting the freezing   process, and about   of them or their husbands have some   sort of health issue. ’ ’   The success rate of pregnancy from frozen eggs is slim. If a   woman freezes eggs at the age of 25, the chance of successfully   giving birth is 30 percent. At the age of 34, it drops to 20   percent. ’ ’   Japan has been struggling to boost its declining birth rate,   which would depress the working population and increase the   financial burden on them as the older generation retires. ’ ’   Urayasu mayor Hideaki Matsuzaki called the low birthrate a   national problem. ’ ’   ”In general, pregnancy and childbirth is an individual issue. But   when the situation has become this far, I consider it a social   problem,” Matsuzaki said. ”I view using public expenditure as the   right thing to do.” ’ ”URAYASU, Japan (AP)  —   A Tokyo suburb will help women cover the cost of freezing their eggs in a pilot program aimed at countering Japan’s declining birth rate.”
