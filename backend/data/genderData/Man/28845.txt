An astonishing video shows a squad of Stanford University’s tiny µTug robots pulling the full weight of a car and driver.[  The Biometric Dextrous Manipulation Laboratory at Stanford has combined the peculiar organizational abilities of ants hauling food with the unique gripping power of gecko toes to create a group of microbots that can pull the more than 3, 900 lb. weight of a car and its driver, despite the robots weighing less than 3. 5 grams combined. Ants are pretty impressive, but while they can work together to move things 100 times their own weight, these robots are moving more than half a million times their combined weight. Think about that for just a moment. The engineers at Stanford tried bots that hopped and walked before settling on a simpler   design. (This is the point where I’m not going to make a “reinventing the wheel” joke, but I could have.) For now, just enjoy the video, and trying to calculate what size a robot would need to be to move an actual mountain. My own rough calculations say we need a roughly 40, 000 ton squad of microbots before we can make the greatest YouTube video of all time.
