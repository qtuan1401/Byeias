The New York Daily News hates God, hates guns, hates cops, and really hates conservatives. Apparently, though, even in   New York City, enough readers are hating the Daily News back to spark yet another round of layoffs for the floundering tabloid:  After a painful fall in which the Daily News was recovering from a downsizing that claimed the jobs of numerous longtime newsroom employees, has the tabloid been hit with cuts yet again? Three sources familiar with the matter told POLITICO as much on Friday. Of late, The Daily News has attempted to remain relevant with a series of shrill, hysterical,   covers.  Hate doesnâ€™t sell. Even to    Democrats. Ask CNN.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
