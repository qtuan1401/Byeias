From David Goldstein writing at McClatchy DC:  Maurice King worked for Joerns Healthcare, a medical furniture manufacturer, for nearly 43 years. Until suddenly one day, he didn’t. Joerns shuttered its plant in Stevens Point, Wis. in 2012 after years of gradually outsourcing work to China. It cut loose 175 workers. Now the    former local steelworkers union president works a   p. m. shift at a fan factory. No more local fish fries on Friday nights with his wife, or his side job for 25 years as town chairman in Dewey, population 975. He hasn’t yet earned a week of vacation. As for retirement?
