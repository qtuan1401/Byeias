 (CNN) Kesha dropped one of her lawsuits against her label and music producer Lukasz ”Dr. Luke” Gottwald in an effort to revive her stalled music career.  Kesha’s attorney told Rolling Stone the singer dropped her civil lawsuit in California, but will continue to pursue appeals in New York where a judge dismissed her sexual abuse claims against Gottwald in April. (The sole claim pending is a request to terminate Kesha’s contract with Gottwald’s company.) Kesha will now focus her efforts toward fulfilling her contract with Gottwald’s Kemosabe Records and parent company Sony Music Entertainment. She recently provided the label 28 new songs in hopes of releasing an album and single soon, her lawyer said. ”My fight continues,” Kesha wrote in a Facebook post. ”I need to get my music out. I have so much to say. This lawsuit is so heavy on my once free spirit, and I can only pray to one day feel that happiness again.”  Kesha’s music career has been in a holding pattern since 2014 when she first brought multiple claims against the famed pop producer, including allegations he drugged, emotionally abused and sexually assaulted her.  Gottwald denied these claims and filed a defamation lawsuit against Kesha. On Monday, Gottwald’s attorney told Rolling Stone the singer dropped her sexual abuse case in California because she had ”no chance of winning.”  In February, a New York judge declined to release Kesha from her contract, citing lack of evidence. Two months later, Kesha faced another legal set back when the same judge threw out most of her claims. As Kesha’s legal battles have waged on, she has drawn public support from fellow artists, including Adele and Taylor Swift.  ”Thank you for all your support,” Kesha added in her statement. ”The support of my fans has been so beautiful and I’m so grateful for it. I’m not sure where I would be without you all.”
