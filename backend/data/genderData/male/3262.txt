After 19 years and five championships with the San Antonio Spurs, Tim Duncan announced Monday morning that he would retire at age 40. Duncan was an elite player on an excellent Spurs team for his entire career. The Spurs made the playoffs every year in his tenure, never with a winning percentage lower than . 610, and won five titles, with Duncan the finals’ most valuable player in three of them. He also won the league M. V. P. Award twice. A relative latecomer to basketball growing up in the Virgin Islands, the    Duncan was initially a swimmer. He was the No. 1 pick in the N. B. A. draft after four years at Wake Forest. (The Spurs had the top pick as a result of a rare down season largely caused by an injury to David Robinson.) The player selected just after Duncan, Keith Van Horn, has been out of the league for a decade. Duncan initially starred in a “twin towers” lineup with Robinson, winning two titles. After Robinson’s retirement in 2004, Duncan carried on as the team’s star, winning three more N. B. A. crowns, most recently in   over the Miami Heat in LeBron James’s last year there. Duncan’s   nature often kept him out of the spotlight, but the sheer force of his accomplishments pushes him onto just about every list of the greats. Duncan ranks fifth in career blocked shots (3, 020) sixth in rebounds (15, 091) seventh in games played (1, 392) and 14th in points (26, 496). Duncan’s playing time had gradually been reduced in recent years, and he had ceded his starring role on the Spurs to Kawhi Leonard. Though he started 60 of the 61 games he played this season, he hit career lows in just about every category. But he was an   as recently as 2015. Duncan’s retirement was as quiet as Kobe Bryant’s was colorful and protracted. The Spurs released a statement highlighting his achievements, but without a quotation from the player. That did not stop many others from singing his praises on Monday: Now Duncan is highly likely to join Bryant in the Hall of Fame in 2021.
