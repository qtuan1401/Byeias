Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos spoke at Dartmouth University tonight giving a speech titled “In Defence Of Hazing” ending his event with a real life fraternity hazing in which he was waterboarded, slapped and smeared with whipped cream.[  MILO was delivered a bottle with a label marked “PISS” by Breitbart writer Mike Ma, and took a sip before experiencing his very own hazing, being creamed and waterboarded by his tour entourage.  Breitbart Tech writer Allum Bokhari delivered a whipped cream slap into the face of MILO who sat, covered in water and foam before returning to the podium for a QA.   Watch the full event below.
