 (CNN) If all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you too? What if your Pokémon took you there? Two men in their early 20s fell an estimated 50 to 90 feet down a cliff in Encinitas, California, on Wednesday afternoon while playing ”Pokémon Go,” San Diego County Sheriff’s Department Sgt. Rich Eaton said. The men sustained injuries, although the extent is not clear. Pokémon Go is a    app that gets users up and moving in the real world to capture fictional ”pocket monsters” known as Pokémon. The goal is to capture as many of  the more than hundred species of animated Pokémon as you can.  Apparently it wasn’t enough that the app warns users to stay aware of surroundings or that signs posted on a fence near the cliff said ”No Trespassing” and ”Do Not Cross.” When firefighters arrived at the scene, one of the men was at the bottom of the cliff while the other was   of the way down and had to be hoisted up, Eaton said. Both men were transported to Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla. They were not charged with trespassing.  Eaton encourages players to be careful. ”It’s not worth life or limb,” he said, In parts of San Diego County, there are warning signs for gamers not to play while driving. San Diego Gas and Electric tweeted a warning to stay away from electric lines and substations when catching Pokémon.  This is the latest among many unexpected situations gamers have found themselves in, despite the game being released just more than a week ago. In one case, armed robbers lured lone players of the wildly popular augmented reality game to isolated locations. In another case, the game led a teen to discover a dead body.
