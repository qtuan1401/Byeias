On January 6 —  the day after President Obama announced executive gun controls to prevent “mass violence” in America —  the Associated Press reported that Obama’s actions would not have stopped one mass shooting in recent memory. [The AP specifically points to the attacks on the Aurora theater, the DC Navy Yard, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Chattanooga military recruitment officers, Umpqua Community College, and San Bernardino —  because the gunmen in all these instances passed background checks to acquire their firearms.  In San Bernardino, Syed Farook passed background checks for his handguns and acquired the rifles through someone else who passed checks for them. Either way, checks were passed, and the impotency of those checks was on full display for the world to see. The AP points to the one heinous attack that Obama and the Democrats bring up again and again —  Sandy Hook Elementary School. However, Obama’s executive gun control would not have hindered, much less prevented, the Sandy Hook attack from occurring, either, because gunman Adam Lanza did not buy his guns. Instead, he sidestepped every facet of gun control by simply stealing his weapons. The New York Daily News came to the same conclusion the AP did, reporting that Obama’s expansion of background checks is “meaningless” because “mass killers” already pass background checks to acquire their firearms. Therefore, when one looks at Obama’s executive orders in their essence, what one sees is that Obama traded a little more of our freedom for the promise of security, but he did so without actually delivering more security. So we simply lost freedom. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart. com.
