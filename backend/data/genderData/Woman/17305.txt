A Rasmussen Reports poll released March 31 shows slightly more than four out of five Americans reject the plan for   cities to pay killers not to kill with guns. [The poll revolved around plans in Baltimore, Toledo, Washington, D. C. and other cities to use money to try to curtail the behavior of killers untouched by a myriad of gun control laws.  Rasmussen asked, “In an effort to reduce their homicide rates, several cities are considering a plan to pay criminals not to commit gun crimes. Do you favor or oppose a plan in your community to pay criminals up to $1, 000 a month not to kill someone with a gun?” In response, five percent of respondents agreed with such a plan, while 81 percent rejected it outright. The Washington Post reports that such a program already exists in Richmond, California, where overlooking certain crimes —  and even an occasional homicide —  is par for the course to keep the program rolling. And this month, the D. C. City Council voted to allot funds to begin financing a program that mirrors the one in Richmond. “Council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (  5) has promised to shift money from the mayor’s other   priorities to launch the program. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
