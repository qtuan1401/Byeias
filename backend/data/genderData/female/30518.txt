The singer later edited her post and removed the hashtag. Clinton and her rival for the Democrat nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, remain locked in a virtual dead heat ahead of Saturday’s crucial Nevada contest. Clinton will attempt to shore up support among younger voters after Sanders won 83 percent of   voters in New Hampshire and 84 percent of millennial voters in Iowa earlier this month, according to CNN polls.
