During MSNBC’s coverage of the shooting of police officers in Dallas, TX, anchor Brian Williams asked Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) whether any “good guys with guns” intervened to stop the shooting of police officers.  Williams asked, “Nothing about last night was political. This guy was a gunman and not a politician, but we’ve heard some politicians say, especially in recent months, that if you have more good guys with guns than the bad guys with guns, that’s going to give you the upper hand in a gunfight. You have an open carry state. Did anything like that happen last night, or were police, perhaps, outgunned at the start of this?” Paxton responded, “I’m a believer in the Second Amendment. Texas has been very liberal in granting people the ability to carry. I think it’s been successful. Obviously, nothing works perfectly, but I think Texas will continue down that path, because if people that are   citizens have the ability to protect themselves, we believe that that’s the better policy. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
