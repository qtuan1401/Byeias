 (CNN) A cruise ship struck a wall in the Eisenhower Lock in upstate New York on Thursday night, injuring some passengers, the U. S. Coast Guard said. Michael Lecuyer, with St. Lawrence County Emergency Services, told CNN that 17 people suffered very minor injuries. CNN affiliate WWNY said the injured, accompanied by 13 of their relatives, were taken off the ship, the Saint Laurent, to be checked out at a local hospital. All were treated and discharged before being brought back to the ship early Friday. There were 274 people, including passengers and crew, aboard the   cruise ship when it hit the lock wall in the Saint Lawrence Seaway in Massena, the Coast Guard said in a news release. As of 6 a. m. ET Friday, the cruise ship remained in the lock and all the passengers are still on board, Lecuyer said. Inspectors will assess the damage during the morning and determine if and when the ship will be able to leave, he said.  A Coast Guard boat was deployed to the scene late Thursday from Alexandria Bay, New York.  The cause of the collision is still being investigated.  The Saint Lawrence Seaway extends more than 2, 000 miles from the Atlantic Ocean to the head of the Great Lakes. The Eisenhower Lock is one of two U. S. locks on the      Canal, which provides access to Lake St. Lawrence.
