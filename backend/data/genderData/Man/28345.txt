President Obama reacted to the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia after wrapping up his golf game in California this afternoon. [“Tonight we honor his extraordinary service to our nation and remember one of the towering legal figures of our time,” Obama said, describing him as a “brilliant legal mind with a pugnacious style, incisive wit, and colorful opinions. ”  The president made his statement at Rancho Mirage, California. But Obama quickly vowed that he would nominate a replacement to the Supreme Court and expected the Senate to confirm his choice. “I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time,” he said. “There will plenty of time for me to do so and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote. ” Obama said he took his constitutional responsibilities “seriously. ” “They’re bigger than any one party,” he added. “They’re about our democracy. ”
