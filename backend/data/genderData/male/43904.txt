’  ’ ’   House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday defended the House GOP   leadership’’s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act,   calling the overhaul of the healthcare system an ”act of mercy”   and guaranteeing it would have enough votes to pass the House. ’ ’   Ryan said the legislation, called  fulfilled Republican   promises to repeal and replace Obamacare and would help to   unburden average Americans from high healthcare costs. ’ ’   ”If we did nothing the law would collapse, and leave everybody   without affordable healthcare,” Ryan said at a press   conference with other House GOP leaders. ”We are doing an act of   mercy by repealing this law and replacing it with     healthcare reforms.” ’ ’   Ryan also said that the ACA was ”collapsing” on its own,   despite relatively stable enrollment numbers in the individual   insurance exchanges over the past few years. ’ ’   The speaker claimed the bill was being   progressed transparently, as opposed to the ACA, which he   said was ”jammed through to an unsuspecting country.” The new   plan, however, has not yet received a score from the   Congressional Budget Office to assess its budgetary or coverage   effects. ’ ’’ ’   Ryan said he plans to have the bill for a floor vote in two   weeks. By comparison, Timothy Jost  —   a professor of health policy   at Washington University in St. Louis who favors the Affordable   Care Act  —   documented  on the ACA over a year, heard from   181 witnesses during that time span, and added 121 amendments to   the law. ’ ’   The press conference occurred shortly after members of   the influential House Freedom Caucus and conservative senators    in   its repeal. Despite the pushback, Ryan said that he would have   the 218 votes needed pass the bill. ’ ’   ”When this thing comes to the floor, we’’ll have 218,” said Ryan.   ”I can guarantee you that.” ’ ’House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday defended the. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
