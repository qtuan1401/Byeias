During a panel discussion hosted by Judicial Watch, former U. S. Attorney for the District of Colombia Joseph diGenova said reading Clinton Cash is the first thing FBI agents investigating Hillary Clinton’s private email server are told to do. [“And the fact that FBI agents are now assigned, the first thing they are told is read Clinton Cash. The Book, and then come and start your investigation,” diGenova said.  “When Mrs. Clinton ordered the deletion of over 30, 000 emails, that was a crime,” diGenova said. “She stole government property. Nobody knows what’s in those emails. She considered them personal. Guess What? She considered the Clinton Foundation personal. ” Days before its May 5, 2015 release, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich was referred to as the “most anticipated and feared book of a presidential cycle,” according to the New York Times. New York Times bestselling author, Breitbart News editor, and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash was the first of its kind to meticulously scrutinize donations received by the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and foreign individuals while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Judicial Watch has sued the federal government in its pursuit to recover documents and information concerning the multiple email accounts and the private server that   of state Hillary Clinton and her aids used to conduct official government business while she was in office.
