Secretary of State John Kerry wants media to stop covering terrorist attacks so “people wouldn’t know what’s going on. ”[The Islamic State “kills people because of who they are,” Kerry said in Bangladesh, adding, “it will take a generation or more to solve it, but let me tell you something: We are defeating Daesh and we will defeat Daesh. We will defeat   and Boko Haram, and we are on the road to achieving that now. ”  Kerry then echoed remarks made by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf last February, who declared “we cannot kill our way out of this war” against the Islamic State, blaming Muslim terrorism on “root causes,” such as a “lack of opportunity for jobs. ” “It’s not just the battlefield it’s the minds. And if we have too many young people who can’t go to school, or too many young people who are frustrated, or they can’t find a job  —   if we leave those minds out there for extremists to recruit, then it will continue and none of us would be doing our jobs if we allowed that to happen,” he added. It’s better if the public is kept in the dark about Islamic terror attacks in their nations, according to Kerry, who warned earlier in his speech that terrorists “no respect for national boundaries. ” “Remember this: No country is immune from terrorism,” Kerry said. It’s easy to terrorize. Government and law enforcement have to be correct 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. But if you decide one day you’re going to be a terrorist and you’re willing to kill yourself, you can go out and kill some people. You can make some noise. Perhaps the media would do us all a service if they didn’t cover it quite as much. People wouldn’t know what’s going on.
