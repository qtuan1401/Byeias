Los Angeles (CNN) Marion ”Suge” Knight’s legal issues are far from over. The former Death Row Records executive has been hit with yet another lawsuit, this time by the widow of Terry Carter, whom Knight is accused of killing in a    in January.  Knight, who has pleaded not guilty to an initial murder charge in Carter’s death, is not alone. Fellow rap moguls Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are also named in the wrongful death lawsuit, along with Cle ”Bone” Sloan, Universal Pictures and other parties involved in the upcoming film ”Straight Outta Compton.” During its production, Knight and Sloan got into a fight in a parking lot, ultimately leaving Sloan injured and Carter dead.  In the new suit, Lillian Carter claims Knight, 50, had a ”custom, practice, and habit of breaking the law.” Carter accuses Universal Pictures and other parties of being negligent toward Knight’s violent past, criminal history, and   problems with certain people working on the film.  Knight is expected in court on July 7 for a preliminary hearing to address the    case and an unrelated robbery charge. He recently hired attorney Thomas Mesereau, known for defending celebrities such as Michael Jackson.  When asked for comment regarding the new allegations, Mesereau said Knight ”denies any liability” and was ”defending himself at all times.”  CNN has also reached out to representatives for Dr. Dre, Cle ”Bone” Sloan, Ice Cube and Universal Pictures.
