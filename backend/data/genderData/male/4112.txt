Q. I’ve been in a lot of restaurants in New York, and I’ve never seen an F in any of those inspection grading cards given out by the health department. Does this mean that all of the restaurants in New York are above average? A. Actually, many of the city’s roughly 24, 000 restaurants do get the worst grades, but the trick is that C, not F, is the lowest one. By now, most New Yorkers are familiar with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s   system, which was introduced in 2010, and assigns ratings based on a   system that is calculated by the amount of major and minor infractions found by inspectors. The dirtier the restaurant, the more points accumulated, the worse the grade. According to a city database, there are more than 200 restaurants that currently have C ratings. There are more than 800 “grade pending” restaurants, because operators of restaurants are given the choice of displaying a “grade pending” sign or a letter grade while they contest any violations. If this makes you a little queasy, keep in mind that New York is generally a culinarily clean city: The A rating is by far the most common, with more than 21, 500 restaurants claiming that blue card. There are more than 1, 500 B ratings. So if you’re contemplating entering a C restaurant, rest assured that moving a few feet down the street might land you in A territory. The health department does not force any restaurant to close over ratings. Restaurants are closed by the department as a temporary emergency measure when there is an immediate public health hazard, such as a severe pest infestation. A restaurant can also be closed as a result of repeated violations or an extensive number of violations. “Once these issues have been corrected, a restaurant may request a reopening inspection,” Carolina Rodriguez, an assistant press secretary with the health department, said in an email.
