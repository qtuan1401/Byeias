The theater was showing Schumer’s film Trainwreck at the time of the shooting. She has since pushed for the expansion of background checks, even though the alleged Lafayette gunman bought his gun in a store and passed a background check to acquire it. Other celebrities —  including Julianne Moore, Brooke Shields, Ron Howard, Sarah Silverman, and Seth Gilliam —  tweeted photos for gun control on Thursday too, but they were all clothed.
