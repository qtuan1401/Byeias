Friday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Democratic National Committee chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) said the Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton was not “a target” of the FBI investigation into her handling of classified material on her private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.  Partial transcript as follows: HEMMER: When that question was posed the to the FBI director this week, James Comey said ‘I don’t know what that means. We are conducting an investigation. That’s the bureau’s business, that’s what we do. I’m not familiar with the term security inquiry.’ Is she taking this as seriously as the FBI is? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I think it’s important to underscore that Secretary Clinton isn’t even a target of this inquiry investigation or whatever “i” word you want to use. HEMMER: how do you know that? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I have repeatedly been told that. My understanding is that Secretary Clinton is not the target of this investigation or whatever you want to call it, HEMMER: Did the FBI share that with you? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I’m only repeating what my understanding is. But beyond that this election will be decided by voters who make sure they have a president who has our backs and won’t take people’s healthcare away now that 20 million people have it who didn’t have it before. And won’t take us back to a time when another president plunged our economy of into the economy since the great depression. HEMMER: In the 5 seconds I have left. Is she taking this FBI matter seriously, yes or no? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: When you release 55, 000 pages of emails and demonstrate the transparencies she has throughout this “i” word, most definitely, and that’s still not what the voters will be making this decision on when they decide who they are voting for for president.
