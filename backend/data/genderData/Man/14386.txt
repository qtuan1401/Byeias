Vice President of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, Dan Gainor, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday for an   discussion of media bias, as well as how media covers   protesters. [“The reality of this country is, according to Gallup, that the Left is   of the country,   percent,” said Gainor. “Conservatives are   percent. And of course, moderates in the middle making up the rest. They [the media] don’t want to remind you of that. ”  Gainor continued, “Then you look at the media landscape, and the media, whether it’s the CNNs of the world, the Washington Post, the New York Times, or, of course, our   media at NPR and PBS, they land smack dab in the middle of the   percent” that is on the Left. “So that means in their world, you’re moderate if you’re to the right of them. That means other liberals. ” “You’re conservative, the David Brookses of the world, if you land in the middle,” he went on. “And you are far right if you’re one of   percent of the country. They want to marginalize you. And honestly, I’m tired of it. I think a lot of conservatives are. ” Concluded Gainor, “We’re tired of being subjected to abuse by media who don’t represent   percent or more of the country. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
