PHILADELPHIA  —   Bakari Sellers tells CNN that New Jersey senator Cory Booker “literally believes in love. ”[The kind words followed Booker’s speech at the Democratic National Convention.  Don Lemon’s     show from the CNN Grill retains some of its Cleveland cast, with the exception of former Ted Cruz employee Amanda Carpenter. “Cory Booker literally believes in love,” said Lemon panelist Bakari Sellers, a former member of the South Carolina state legislature. “Personally I like him,” Lemon said of Booker. Lemon also had former Bernie Sanders comms director Symone Sanders on the show, who defended the   rebels. Bernie Sanders supporters booed almost every speaker at the convention in Philly. It remains unclear whether Bill Clinton, speaking Tuesday night, will get booed as well.
