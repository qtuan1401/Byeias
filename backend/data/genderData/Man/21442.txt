Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” host Joy Reid disagreed with chairman of the Black Republican Caucus of Florida Sean P. Jackson when he said that if it was not for Republicans,   would still be enslaved.  “Sean, Abraham Lincoln is long dead. Let’s talk about the current Republican nominee,” Reid said. “I think the reason   have civil rights is because   fought for them. ” “Republicans are the ones that passed it when Democrats continually turned it down,” Jackson replied. “No, that’s not true, either,” Reid interrupted.
