SIMI VALLEY  —   During an exclusive interview with Breitbart News at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Friday, Newt Gingrich shared a fond memory he had of late First Lady Nancy Reagan.[  He described a side of her most never had the opportunity to see. “We were here [at the Reagan library] with Nancy for dinner one night and Merv Griffin was here. And after dinner, we went over and gathered around the piano. And Merv sang ‘Nancy With a Happy Face,’ which is a Frank Sinatra song. ” Gingrich said Nancy expressed “joy” while the song was being dedicated to her. “She was basking in an old friend and a song that she could sort of identify with. And you could send some of the relaxed part of Nancy as opposed to the public figure. It was a really great evening. ” Nancy Reagan was laid to rest next to her husband’s grave on Friday.
