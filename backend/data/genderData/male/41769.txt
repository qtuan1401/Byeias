Washington (CNN) HBO’s ”Game of Thrones” lost a viewer Tuesday morning: Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. The Democrat, an avid tweeter, cited a particularly ”gratuitous rape scene” that ended the most recent episode Sunday night as her reason for signing off.  ”Ok, I’m done Game of Thrones. Water Garden, stupid. Gratuitous rape scene disgusting and unacceptable. It was a rocky ride that just ended,” McCaskill tweeted Tuesday morning.  The blockbuster HBO fantasy series, based on George R. R. Martin novels and now in its fifth season, has been characterized by its extreme violence and sex since it began in 2010.  On Wednesday, McCaskill tweeted: ”Ok, winter is definitely coming. I just expressed an opinion. Cumulative effect violence  brutality took its toll. Sansa rape last straw. #GOT” ”Kinda depressing that so many more people have opinions about #GOT than reform of US intelligence gathering that I also tweeted about ystrdy,” she followed up. Since arriving in Washington in 2007, McCaskill has been a vocal advocate on issues related to sexual violence, including cosponsoring legislation targeting sexual assault’s prevalence on college campuses and in the military.  She’s also known for her active embrace of Twitter, using the social media platform to share her often relatively unfiltered opinions on politics as well as pop culture, technology and sports.
