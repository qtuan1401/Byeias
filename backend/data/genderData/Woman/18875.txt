Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” host Joy Reid defined “identity politics” as a “slanderous way” of saying to not talk about people of color, people of the LGBT community or other marginalized communitites.  “[T]here is this big debate among Democrats, whether or not they should throw what they are calling ‘identity politics,’ which is sort of a slanderous way of saying, ‘Don’t talk about people of color, LGBT people and other marginalized communities anymore because we need to focus on white,   people,’ and there’s a debate over whether to do that or not,” Reid said to former DNC pollster Cornell Belcher.
