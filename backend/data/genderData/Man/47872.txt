’  ’ ’   Eight years after the subprime crisis, news of a startup bringing   institutional   exposure to individual investors may be   met with some skepticism. ’ ’   But Michael Burry, the hedge fund manager who foresaw the housing   market’’s nosedive and was immortalized in the movie ”The Big   Short,” clearly doesn’’t think so. ’ ’   He was an early investor in a new        lending platform called . ’ ’   PeerStreet, cofounded by Brett Crosby and Brew Johnson, is   applying the    lending model to real estate, giving   investors access to   private   loans. ’ ’   As investors diversify assets in a    world,   Crosby and Johnson seek to take an asset class that was   traditionally only available to institutional investors like   banks and hedge funds and make it accessible to a wider audience   of accredited investors. ’ ’   To qualify as an  a person must have an income of at least   $200, 000 per year or a joint income of $300, 000 per year in each   of the last two years. ’ ’      lending is the practice of lending money to people   or businesses through online services that match lenders directly   with borrowers. With lower overheads and smaller fees, these   lenders offer consumers a chance to get loans quickly and easily,   compared with banks and other financial institutions that have   tightened   policies after the financial crisis.   While online lenders often lend to those who may not qualify for   bank finance, they also run the risk of higher defaults. ’ ’   The modern    lending industry in the US really started   with the launch of Prosper and Lending Club in 2006, and it is   forecasted to reach over $150 billion by 2025, . ’ ’  ’ ”   PeerStreet works with local, private, nonbank money lenders from   17 states to source   loan investments. PeerStreet’s   loans are all for business properties not occupied by the owner. ” ’   ”Typically, the borrowers that work with our lender partners are     entrepreneurs who are purchasing properties for   investment, with the intention to make improvements to the homes   and then sell them,” Crosby said. ’ ’   Alternatively, a borrower may be purchasing a property and   looking to stabilize it by getting a tenant in place so that they   can refinance into a traditional mortgage. ”They only need     financing, and banks typically don’’t offer attractive   options for them, if any,” Crosby said. ’ ’   The loans are underwritten by PeerStreet using advanced   algorithms,   analytics, manual processes, and      due diligence to filter and select the ones that   are high quality. These loans are then funded by accredited   investors on the online platform. ’ ’   Crosby previously founded the web analytics company Urchin   Software, which was sold to Google in 2005. He stayed on at   Google for 10 years, building out mobile, advertising, and   Chrome, and cofounding Google Analytics. ’ ’   Crosby grew up in Orange County, California, and met fellow   cofounder Johnson at the University of Southern California. ’ ’  ’ ’   Johnson was a   attorney who eventually approached   Crosby with his idea of using technology to make     financing accessible to the individual investor. PeerStreet was   born. ’ ”   Accredited investors can choose investments    or use an   automated investment tool that matches a person’s investment   criteria to loans in the portfolio. ” ’   The minimum investment amount is $1, 000. Usually the loans are   crowdfunded to the total amount, and PeerStreet claims investors   can earn   returns. ’ ’   The loans are typically   ranging from six to 24   months, and are made across the country on different types of     projects, with different originators and different   property types, to create a wide diversification of potential   investments. ’ ’   The company opened to investors in October 2015 and has funded   over $75 million in   loan investments on the platform,   returning over $25 million to investors so far. ’ ’   While    lending has recently faced scrutiny in the   wake of the  that called into question the   integrity of the model, Crosby points to the robust and   conservative underwriting platform that PeerStreet employs. There   have been zero defaults thus far, but the startup is still in its   infancy. ’ ’   For now, ”the sky is the limit,” Crosby told Business Insider. ’ ’   Their goal was to give everyone access to these     private   loans, but current regulation means that the   startup is limited to only opening up the asset class to   accredited investors. ’ ’   ”If and when regulations change, and it becomes less cumbersome   to provide everyone access to our investments, we would   definitely like to open up to a more   investor   base,” Crosby said. ’
