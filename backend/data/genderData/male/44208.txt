’  ’ ’   On Wednesday, Škoda announced plans to unveiled an     electric crossover SUV concept called the Vision E at the 2017   Shanghai Motor Show. ’ ’   Unfortunately for US car buyers, Škoda, a subsidiary of   Volkswagen Group, is not available on this side of the Atlantic. ’ ’   Which is a real shame because the Vision E looks like a winner. ’ ’expects the electric crossover to offer   as much as 311 miles of electric range. ’ ’   The Vision E will be driven by a pair of   electric   motors  —   one mounted on each axle. Together, the duo create a   virtual    system while producing roughly 300 total   horsepower. ’ ’   Škoda did not offer an expected   time, but did say that   the concept should be able to reach a top speed of 112mph. ’ ’   In addition, the concept is also slated to conform with level 3   requirements for autonomous driving. ’ ’   ”It can operate independently in traffic jams, go into autopilot   on motorways, stay in lane and swerve, carry out overtaking   maneuvers, independently search for free parking spaces and park   and leave parking spaces alone,” Škoda wrote in a statement. ’ ’  ’ ”   The sleek four door crossover will be built on VW Group’s MEB   electric car platform. ” ”   According to the Czech automaker, the Vision E offers a glimpse   into the company’s future electric mobility strategy. ” ’   ”Škoda is intensively pursuing the electrification of its model   range, and will be offering five purely electric models in   various segments by 2025,” the company wrote. The first of the   those models to appear will be a   hybrid version of the   Skoda Superb sedan in 2019. ’ ’   The 2017 Shanghai Motor Show will run from April 21  —   28 at the   National Exhibition and Convention Center next to Hongqiao   International Airport. ’ ’On Wednesday, Škoda announced plans to. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
