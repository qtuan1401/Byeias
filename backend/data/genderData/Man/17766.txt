A white male student at San Francisco State University was harassed by a black female student for having dreadlocks and therefore “appropriating” African culture. [The video, which starts halfway through the incident, shows the black student confronting a white student wearing dreadlocks.  The video begins with the woman threatening the man by asking her friend whether he has a pair of scissors. An argument ensues as the student insists on his right to have dreadlocks regardless of the style’s cultural origins. “You’re saying I can’t have this hairstyle because of your culture? Why?” asks the student. “Because it’s my culture,” responds the student. The woman proceeds to grab him as he begins to walk away from the situation. When the white student pushes back, she accuses the man of putting his hands on her. The incident ends with the woman realising that she is being filmed and proceeds to grab the camera away from the person filming.

The University has clarified that this is not the case.
