Martha Raddatz, who is set to moderate Saturday night’s Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire, had President Barack Obama as a guest at her wedding. [Raddatz married Obama’s Harvard Law School classmate and Harvard Law Review cohort Julius Genachowski in 1991, years before Obama appointed Genachowski to head the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Obama went to the wedding, years before he became a national politician.  As Breitbart News’ Matt Boyle reported in 2013: ABC News chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz said Monday evening that the fact President Barack Obama attended her wedding to her now   Julius Genachowski —  Obama’s Federal Communications Commission chairman —  ’had nothing to do with what I did at the debate.’ Raddatz told Breitbart News at that time: I didn’t do anything. I mean, I didn’t have to handle that. It was  —   and I’m really not going to comment about that. That was something that happened two days before the debate. It had been in The New York Times quite a while before that, I believe. I just got to put this out of my head. That had nothing to do with what I did at the debate. Nothing. Raddatz, who recently became   of the ABC Sunday morning program This Week with George Stephanopoulos, is now getting ready to moderate the ABC News debate, where she will question the Republican candidates ahead of Tuesday’s   New Hampshire primary.
