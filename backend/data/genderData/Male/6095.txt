SEOUL, South Korea  —   North Korea launched an   ballistic missile, but the test failed as the projectile exploded shortly after liftoff, the South Korean military said on Sunday. The North’s   missile, also known as the Musudan, took off at 12:33 p. m. on Saturday near an airfield in the northwestern city of Kusong, the South said in a statement. The test was the first involving the   since North Korea successfully launched the same missile in June. North Korea has had a spotty record with   test flights. The June launch was the first successful test after five failures. The projectile flew about 250 miles over the sea between North Korea and Japan, reaching an altitude of 878 miles. That test alarmed the United States and its allies in the region. Their defense officials said the missile’s launch at a sharp angle prevented it from falling too close to Japan but still demonstrated its potential to reach an estimated range of more than 2, 000 miles. The   is the North’s only tested missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in Guam in the Pacific, and in South Korea and Japan. After the June test, the North Korean leader, Kim   boasted that his country had the capability to strike those bases. But the failure on Saturday indicated that North Korea has yet to perfect its   system. The   is a   missile, so it can be moved around the country and hidden in tunnels, making it more difficult to target in a   strike. North Korea has vowed to build a ballistic missile capable of striking the continental United States with a nuclear warhead. The North has never conducted a test flight for such a   missile. It conducted its fifth underground nuclear test on Sept. 9.
