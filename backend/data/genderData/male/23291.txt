The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 forever changed the New York City skyline but the resolve of New Yorkers has never wavered. Fifteen years later a touching memorial now stands in remembrance to the more than 3, 000 people who lost their lives when terrorists flew two airplanes into the World Trade Center towers. [Standing in the footprint of the twin towers now sits two spectacular pools lined with the names of those who perished:    The Freedom Tower built after the attack casts its shadow over the memorial: People from around the world pay homage at the memorial and several leave flowers and other mementos for the departed:  Firefighters stand at attention outside the firehouse near the memorial: Every anniversary the families of the fallen read the individual names of all those who died in the attack: People bring pictures of the people they lost to keep their memories alive:  A Choir sings and bagpipes play:  Former Governor George Pataki who was governor during the attack comforts people in the crowd: Signs of patriotism are everywhere:  While heightened security keeps everyone safe: Jen Lawrence and Mona Salama also contributed to this article.
