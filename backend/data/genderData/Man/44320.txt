’  ’ ”   If you’re to believe Uber’s lawyers, the fate of the $69 billion   company  from an opponent trying to   stop its work on   cars.  ” ”   Waymo, a subsidiary of   company Alphabet, sued Uber   in February claiming it stole trade secrets. Weeks later, it   filed a preliminary injunction to try to stop Uber’s work on     cars until the case resolves.  ” ”   Uber obviously doesn’t want that to happen, but not because it   may just slow down its research. A stop to the   car   work would apparently threaten to topple Uber’s entire   business.  ” ’   In its  Uber said stopping its work on     cars would threaten its future as a ”a viable   business.” ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’   Of course, many people question whether a company that’’s believed   to be losing billions of dollars a year is a ”viable” business to   begin with. The    company hasn’’t yet figured out   how to make humans in the drivers seat work as a profitable   business, and it’’s also tackling everything from food delivery to   vertical take off planes. ’ ’   Discussions about the current viability aside, Uber continues to   repeat that   cars are ”existential” to its future   even though internally the company crowned 2017 the year of   the driver (the human kind). ’ ’   Even when it comes to its bottomline, Uber hasn’’t bet the house,   based on its own internal calculations. In March,  that removing the driver from the   equation would ”only increase Uber’’s projected   net   profit margin by as much as 5 percentage points,”  ’ ”   So if a robocar fleet is the El Dorado of profitability, why does   it consider   cars the only way it can remain viable?   It’s because its CEO Travis Kalanick has a great fear of his   entire business being left behind and has already bet that   autonomous cars are the future.  ” ’   Take this interview with Business Insider in August 2016 right   after it purchased Otto, the company at the heart of the lawsuit   (emphasis ours): ’ ” Biz Carson: You called the development of autonomous     vehicles existential to the company, and you’ve also called     buying Otto another existential move. So what is so existential     about it and where is that threat really coming from? ” ’     Kalanick: I think it starts with understanding that the     world is going to go   and autonomous. Because,     well, a million fewer people are going to die a year.     Traffic in all cities will be gone. Significantly reduced     pollution and trillions of hours will be given back to people  —       quality of life goes way up. Once you go, ”All right, there’’s a     lot of upsides there” and you have folks like the folks in     Mountain View, [California,] a few different companies working     hard on this problem, this thing is going to     happen. So if that’’s happening, what would happen     if we weren’’t a part of that future? If we weren’’t part of the     autonomy thing? Then the future passes us by, basically, in a     very expeditious and efficient way. ’ ” Carson: How soon will   cars realistically     be a significant portion of Uber’s fleet? ” ”     Kalanick: That is the   question, and I wish     I had an answer for you on that one, but I don’t. What     I know is that I can’t be wrong. Right? I have to make sure     that I’m ready when it’s ready or that I’m making it     ready. So, I have to be tied for first at the least.   ” ”   Calling a single injunction a threat to Uber’s future may be   a bit of hyperbole on the behalf of Uber’s lawyers, but it   does match the paranoia of Uber’s CEO. ” ”   Kalanick strongly believes that Uber needs to be among the   leaders of the   car revolution, even if internally   the company doesn’t think it’ll radically change the business.   Uber’s already  in multiple ways,  which is trying to   impede its development. Uber may sound hysterical that its future   could really be up in smoke if a preliminary injunction goes   through, but in the mind of its CEO,   cars are one   thing that it has to have before the future passes it by. ” ”If you’re to believe Uber’s lawyers, the fate. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
