PARIS (AP)  —   With a    video game and   rhetoric, French   candidate   Melenchon is rattling financial markets by swelling in polls just 11 days before the presidential vote. [Melenchon’s surge is the latest surprise in a   campaign that’s being closely watched around Europe, and in which   populism has played a starring role.  Most polling agencies still show that centrist Emmanuel Macron and   candidate Marine Le Pen are leading ahead of the April 23 first round and advance to the May 7 runoff. But Melenchon has risen in recent weeks to roughly third place, around even with conservative Francois Fillon. Melenchon’s   wit during the two presidential debates have boosted his standing. He promises to heavily tax the rich and pull France out of NATO and trade pacts.
