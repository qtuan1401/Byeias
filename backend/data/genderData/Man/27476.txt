A former professional wrestler took down a man who tried to rob him at a Florida gas station.[  Former WWE star Shad Gaspard, 35,   the   robber at a Valero gas station in Coral Springs, WPLG reported. Surveillance video shows Gaspard walking into the gas station convenience store and being approached by a man in a   shirt and dark pants. Police said the suspect, Jason Felix, 35, got angry after he ordered Gaspard to buy him a beer and he refused. “He lifts up his shirt and reaches and grabs a gun,” Gaspard told WPLG. “So he puts the gun into his waist belt and he goes, ‘You need to get out of here, man, because I’m about to rob this place. ’” Gaspard discovered that the weapon he had was just a BB gun. Gaspard grabbed the gun and pinned Felix to the ground outside the store until police arrived. “I grabbed him by the back of the head and I run him into the store door,” Gaspard said. “And when I run him to the store door, I get him outside, I grabbed him in a rear choke and I throw him up and I get him on the ground. ” Gaspard said he did not use his wrestling moves, but used moves he learned as a personal bodyguard. “I just did what came natural. I wasn’t trying to be a hero,” he said. Coral Springs police said Felix was arrested on an armed robbery charge, UPI reports. Gaspard, who now lives in California and works as an actor, was half of the WWE wrestling duo known as Cryme Tyme.
