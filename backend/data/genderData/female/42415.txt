 (CNN) The City Council of Spokane, Washington, unanimously voted Rachel Dolezal off the Police Ombudsmen Commission on Thursday after an investigation showed she and two other members acted inappropriately.  Dolezal, the woman who is accused of lying about her race, chaired the volunteer commission, which is meant to provide citizen oversight of the police department.   The misconduct allegations, which include workplace harassment and improper government action, came to light in a whistleblower complaint and are unrelated to the race accusations, which catapulted her into the national spotlight this week. The city of Spokane had started the investigation in May and found that three commissioners, including Dolezal, created an negative work environment and tried to adopt policies before a new ombudsman was in place.  Spokane Mayor David Condon called for the the resignation of the commissioners  Wednesday.   ”The conduct of these three members is a very serious violation of the public trust that we cannot tolerate violation of the three,” he said.
