Sarah Hopkins, an   of alleged gunman Cedric Ford, is charged with supplying the guns tied to the February 25 shooting, which took three lives in Hesston, Kansas. [Ford was a felon who could not buy guns on his own, nor could he legally possess them. Hopkins faces up to ten years if convicted for supplying them.  According to NBC News, a pawn shop employee said, “Hopkins bought the guns in March 2014. ” One was an   variant, and the other, a Glock handgun. On Friday, Hopkins told the ATF that in August 2015, she removed the guns from the home she once shared with Ford, “but returned them to Ford after he threatened her. ” USA Today quotes a Witchita Eagle report that police helped get the guns out of Newton, Kansas, when Hopkins and Ford ended their relationship. But she is now “charged with one count of knowingly transferring a firearm to a convicted felon” for allegedly taking the guns back to Ford. Hopkins is “the mother of Ford’s two children. ” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton believes Ford may have been set off Thursday when presented with a protective order around 3:30 p. m. His shooting spree began about 90 minutes later. Hopkins is not the woman who asked law enforcement to serve the protective order, however. The woman associated with the protective order remains unnamed. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
