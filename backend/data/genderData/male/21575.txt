Monday on MSNBC while discussing Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein’s attempts to initiate recounts of the presidential vote in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, former DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) said, “Since with Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, are all states where the margin has narrowed and essentially is razor thin,” the recount is a “good thing. ”  Wasserman Schultz said, “Well, anything we can do to make sure that there is more confidence than currently exists in the wake of this election, particularly since with Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, are all states where the margin has narrowed and essentially is razor thin. The Jill Stein campaign made a decision to pursue a recount. They apparently intend to pay for it. Hillary Clinton’s campaign, rightfully so, wants to be represented by counsel to make sure the recount moves forward properly. And that’s a legal and perfectly acceptable avenue to pursue. And if it gives more confidence to the outcome, then that’s a good thing. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
