A man has been charged with assault and battery after he posted a video on Facebook showing himself boxing with his    son. [The father, identified as Tavis Sellers, said the boxing match between him and his son was intended as punishment for the boy’s decision to swear at his school teacher earlier that day.  “All day went by, he didn’t call. So now it’s discipline time because he didn’t do what I told him to do. He chooses to do what he wants to do,” Sellers said. Sellers said he prefers boxing to beating his boy with a belt, first, “for not following my directions” and “secondly, [to] teach him how to defend himself. ” After a brief prelude, Sellers pointed the camera toward his son and began sparring.

You gonna cut up in school this is what you gotta deal with when you come home,” Sellers said to his son as the two traded punches. “I ain’t worried about blood. I ain’t worried about blood. Look at the wall,” Sellers said as the boy sobbed and winced from the pain. “Clean yourself up,” the father said before forcing his son to deliver an   apology to his teacher. Sellers turned himself in to police and was released on $5, 000 bond,  according to WUSA, while his son is in the care of family members. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson.
