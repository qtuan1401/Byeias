Recent search engine results indicate Google, whose CEO is a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, is suppressing negative search results about the Democratic party’s presidential nominee. [Searches for “Hillary Clinton’s  ” across three different search engines provide quite different results. When searched on Google, the first suggested searches provided are “Hillary Clinton’s headquarters,” “Hillary Clinton’s health plan,” and “Hillary Clinton’s healthcare plan. ”  Search results on Bing return the suggestions, “Hillary Clinton’s health,” “Hillary Clinton’s health issues,” and “Hillary Clinton’s health and weight,” while search results on Yahoo return the suggestions, “Hillary Clinton’s health problems,” Hillary Clinton’s health,” and “Hillary Clinton’s health issues. ” Earlier in August, New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo called on Google to “fix” search results related to Clinton’s health. “Google should fix this. It shouldn’t give quarter to conspiracy theorists,” he tweeted. This isn’t the first time that Google has been accused of favouring one presidential candidate over another. In June, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange accused Google of being “directly engaged in Hillary Clinton’s campaign. ” Later that month a video was released proving that Google was altering search results in favour of the Democratic Presidential nominee.  Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, runs a   digital group called The Groundwork which directly focuses on Clinton’s digital media presence.
