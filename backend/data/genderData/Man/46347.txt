This myth from the country’s folk traditions has persisted, and the niggling suspicion that the  may still be out there among the rocks has even led to Icelandic road and housing plans being altered to avoid sites associated with them. Now, there’s an  that shows you exactly where such sites can be found.’ ’Iceland’s  compiled and published the map last fall, linking traditional folk tales featuring   Huldufólk (“hidden people”) with locations all across the island. While deciphering the attached stories can be a challenge for those who don’t speak Icelandic, what’s striking is the   volume of tales mapped.’ ’Zoom into any corner of the map and you will find an incredibly dense scattering of sightings, stories, and legends about the hidden people, sprinkling almost all of the island’s   landscape with an intricate network of tales and supposed elf sightings. This past winter, a large portion of this unpopulated zone was back in the (Icelandic) news, as campaigners, including Björk and her  have lobbied to have the region protected by a .’ ’’ ’If created, the park would cover 40 percent of the entire country.

Having this stark, ominously beautiful landscape in their backyards could help to explain why Icelanders’ belief in nature spirits has persisted.

I would personally challenge anyone to visit the highlands and not feel a little spooked.’ ’The folk tales mapped across this terrain are, by contrast, entirely human in their concerns. Icelandic stories told about elves were, like all folk tales, vehicles for ordinary people to explore their own    concerns —  hunger, sex, jealousy —  through supernatural proxies whose form and stature was still similar to their own. As Terry Gunnell, one of the map’s   commented in the introduction to an Icelandic folk tale  elves are:’ ’’ ’’ ’It’s this idea that lives on in the drive to cover almost half the country with a new national park. Iceland’s interior may be inhospitable and almost lunar in appearance, but for centuries it’s been a stomping ground for the imagination —  an imagination that sees the volatile volcanic landscape as full of life.   a road to bypass a reputed fairy stone might seem somewhat ludicrous, but the spirit behind the move —  of respect, forbearance and a need to balance human needs with those of others —  is one we should all hold on to.’ ’It’s an  . ..’
