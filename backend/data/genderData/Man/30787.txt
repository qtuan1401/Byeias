As President Obama toured the Detroit auto show, he briefly commented on the magnificent Corvette Stingray before spending most of his time focused on the new Chevrolet Electric “Bolt. ”[Live footage of Obama’s visit to the auto show showed Obama spending about five minutes looking at the electric vehicle  —   but only commenting on the Corvette in passing.  “You know it’s subtle,” he joked after seeing the new model of the Corvette, painted bright yellow. The handful of GM executives laughed at his joke. “That one is juiced up a little more,” Obama added. “That looks all right. ” He turned immediately to the burnt orange Bolt  —   a smaller version of the Chevrolet Volt  —   and climbed inside to view the interior. “Fantastic. That’s a nice looking car,” he said referring to the Bolt. Obama also visited the Chrysler exhibit to look at the Pacifica model of the minivan, and referred to the movie “Get Shorty. ” “Beautiful. You guys remember ‘Get Shorty,’ right?” he said to the press pool. “It’s cool driving a minivan. ” Obama’s Senior Adviser to the Director of the National Economic Council Charlie Anderson also praised the Bolt on Twitter: A #MadeInAmerica electric car that can travel 200m on 1 charge. Good 4 climate and wallet. #DetroitAutoShow pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Anderson (@Charlie44) January 20, 2016,  Re the Bolt: U.
