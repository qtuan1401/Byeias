’  ’ ’   The    who dropped out of New York University to start   a hedge fund says he has raised $5 million. ’ ’   Julian Marchese launched Marchese Investments last year after   . ’ ’   In September,  he was managing about $1 million at his   startup and planning to raise around $3 million more. So the   $5 million raised is slightly above his expectations. ’ ”   Technically, Marchese Investments runs separately managed   accounts, and the firm is small enough that it doesn’t have to   file regulatory filings on its assets, so Business Insider hasn’t   independently verified the figures. ” ’   Marchese told Business Insider the bulk of the new   investments came from one investor, but declined to identify   who was writing the checks. ’ ”   Chris Kohler, an investment consultant at Mercer, is one of   Marchese’s advisors helping him with business strategy. Kohler   said he had high hopes for Marchese. ” ’   ”Some of the [hedge fund] all stars now, if you really track   back, they were the ones that started doing this in high school   and college,” Kohler told Business Insider. ’ ”   To be sure, $5 million is peanuts in the world of hedge funds  —     institutional investors like pensions and endowments don’t   usually start looking at funds until they have at least $100   million or so. ” ’   But then again, few people start investment firms at age   20.  ’ ’  ’ ’     ’
