Washington (CNN) Support for tighter gun control laws increased 9 percentage points after the Orlando terror attack, and support for background checks and other measures being debated in the Senate hovered around 90% according to   poll released Monday. The support for tougher gun laws rose to 55% in the newest poll    the highest number since just one month after the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in January 2013.  But support for specific gun control measures was very strong, with 92% saying they wanted expanded background checks, 87% supporting a ban for felons or people with mental health problems and 85% saying they would ban people on federal watchlists from buying guns. Among Republicans, that number is even higher    90% say they favor preventing people on the terror watch list or ”no fly” list from buying a gun. That number is at 85% for Democrats.  Versions of those proposals are being taken up in the Senate Monday evening    but are all expected to fail along mostly   votes.  However, stricter gun control measures, like banning assault rifles and   ammunition clips, only won the support of 54% of respondents. FULL RESULTS:   poll on gun control, Widespread support for tougher gun laws also increased after the massacre in Charleston last summer to 49% but by the fall it had dropped slightly to 46%.  A large share of people (67%) said in January that they support executive action on guns from President Barack Obama, but a large number, almost 6 in 10, also said they did not think those changes would curb gun violence. The latest   poll also found that a stark partisan divide on the issue remains    with 78% of Democrats supporting tougher laws, 29% of Republicans supporting tougher laws and independents almost evenly split (53% support tougher laws.) Pollsters queried 1, 001 adults between June 16 and June 19 and most results carry a    3 percentage point margin of error.
