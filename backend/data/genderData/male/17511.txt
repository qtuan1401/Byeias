Breitbart News investigative reporter Patrick Howley said Saturday that he has quit Twitter, and he encouraged likeminded patriots to do the same. [In an interview on Breitbart News Saturday on Sirius XM Channel 125 with host Matthew Boyle and   Amanda House, Howley explained how his Twitter exit makes it more difficult for the insular mainstream media to control the narrative about his statements.  “Well, Matt, you know, look: I was one of the greatest tweeters of all time,” Howley said, adding: Truly. I was hilarious. I was insightful. I was, you know, unhinged. I was unleashed on America. I was really, really good at tweeting —  an artist at tweeting, I would say. However, this sometimes leads to headlines in enemy publications about how I’ve said something controversial or something provocative. Howley explained that he is leaving the Twitter domain to figures like Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who has been suspended from Twitter multiple times but continues to tweet about his cultural libertarian views and colorful lifestyle. “I think it’s a dysfunctional place,” Howley said of political Twitter. “I think it’s a place where the Establishment media just kind of sits around among themselves. ” He went on to say, “I don’t want enemy publications to frame the narrative. I want to be able to come on this show and talk to you and Amanda, and I want to write for Breitbart, but I don’t want Politico and these other things to take my tweets out of context. ” “This isn’t censorship. I’m not running or hiding. It’s just a tactic. It’s a strategy. I’m just not going to tweet anymore and allow them to frame the narrative. ” Howley noted that we at Breitbart News “create our own world here, and our own infrastructure in news, so that we can control the narrative with the truth, with accurate information, and we can go around this mainstream media apparatus that lies and distorts. ” “Don’t follow me on Twitter,” Howley said to Breitbart listeners as he signed off.
