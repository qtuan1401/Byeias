Fans of the popular Disney film Frozen took to social media Monday morning to petition the studio to give the film’s princess, Elsa, a female love interest in the upcoming sequel. [The hashtag #GiveElsaAGirlfriend began trending Monday morning as hundreds of posters asked Disney to include a gay character in its roster of iconic Princesses.  #GiveElsaAGirlfriend Okay  …     but just imagine  …     a biracial queer princess couple.

Representation is important. #GiveElsaAGirlfriend,  —   jordan (@thejordanthrash) May 1, 2016,  Writers at the Wrap and the Independent noted that Elsa would be a prime choice to receive a female love interest in the sequel, as Frozen is already one of the more “progressive” Disney animated films and its most popular song, “Let It Go,” is an anthem in the gay community. “What better candidate is there for that honour than Elsa, whose own journey of acceptance with her powers has widely been interpreted as a metaphor for coming out?” writes the Independent‘s Clarisse Loughrey. Still, not everyone wanted to see such a change, particularly in an animated children’s film: World has gone PC mad. What’s it even matter? My 2 year old niece (target audience) won’t know the difference or care. #GiveElsaAGirlfriend,  —   Jake!

J.R (@Yonkers_Halface) May 2, 2016,  It’s completely wrong that the pop culture page says ”everyone” wants #GiveElsaAGirlfriend. Let’s ask parents if they want that? I don’t,  —   Alice (@RegularAlice26) May 2, 2016,  There is some recent precedent for gay Disney characters just last month, an episode of the fairy tale drama One Upon a Time featured a lesbian “true love’s kiss” between Ruby and the Wizard of Oz‘s Dorothy. Disney announced a sequel to Frozen in March, though no release date has been set. The first film became a instant smash hit, taking in more than $1. 2 billion in worldwide box office.
