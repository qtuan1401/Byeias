Bannon. “He is a man of integrity, a man of honor, a man who has proven he will not bow down to the Washington cartel, the corrupt career politicians in both parties. ”  “The problem with America is not that we need to make more deals,” Cruz explained. “The problem with America is the deals that have been made behind closed doors on the backs of the American people. We need to get back to a servant leader, someone who realizes that we don’t work for the government, the government works for us. Someone who is truly a servant of we the people. ” Cruz also argued that the American people need to choose a president who will appoint, “justices that abide by the constitution and the rule of law and won’t legislate from the bench. ” He warned that,”If we appoint another liberal justice we will lose all those freedom for perhaps a generation. ” Breitbart News Daily airs from   EST on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125.
