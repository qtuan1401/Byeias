’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Jolie filed for sole physical custody of the   children:  ’ ’  ’ ’   Pitt can accept those terms, or her may file his own claim on the   children, resulting in a different arrangement. ’ ”   To decide how the children will be split up, the court will   likely consider the distinctly different backgrounds of   each of the   children,   who’s been involved in cases   that have involved celebrities like Rudy Giuliani, Martin   Scorsese, Mike Tyson, and Tom Clancy. The judge may also consider   n and   Jolie’s past health issues. ” ’  ’ ’ t’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’   As for the children themselves, the court will have to decide on   a form of custody and visitation that’’s in ”the best   interest” for each child. ’ ’  ’ ”   Each child has a different background. Three are adopted from   other countries, and three are biologically theirs, two of which   are twins. Because their histories are so divergent, the court   might find Jolie better than Pitt at handling a particular   child’s issues, or vice versa. ” ’  ’ ’   ”It’’s bad enough if you have two children, born of a marriage,”   Felder said. ”But let’’s say you have two children who were   adopted at different times, it gets worse. Here, you have six   children!” ’ ”   The court is going to have a psychiatric evaluation of everyone   involved. With six children from various backgrounds, it’s going   to take a long time, Felder said. The court might have to get   special psychiatric evaluators that have expertise in the   countries where each child was raised. That way, the court can   figure out each child’s individual needs, and use that   information to decide which parent is best at handling them. ”
