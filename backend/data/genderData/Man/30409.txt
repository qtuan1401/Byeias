Filmmaker and New York native Spike Lee made his support for presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders known in a radio ad released Tuesday morning. [“Wake up, South Carolina!” Lee said in the   radio spot. “This is your dude, Spike Lee. And I know that you know this system is rigged! For too long, we’ve given our votes to corporate puppets. ”   Lee referred to the socialist senator from Vermont as “Bernie from Brooklyn,” while detailing the Democratic hopeful’s   civil rights record. “That’s why I’m officially endorsing my brother Bernie Sanders,” Lee said, adding: Bernie takes no money from corporations —  nada! Which means he is not on the take. And when Bernie gets in the White House, he will do the right thing. How can we be sure? Bernie was at the March on Washington with Dr. King. He was arrested in Chicago for protesting segregation in public schools. Lee’s endorsement and this new radio ad come just four days ahead of Saturday’s Democratic primary in South Carolina, where Clinton and Sanders have gone out of their way to appeal to the Palmetto State’s heavily black electorate. In South Carolina over the weekend, Clinton’s campaign released an ad narrated by actor Morgan Freeman. Hillary Clinton currently holds a   lead over Bernie Sanders in South Carolina, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.
