On March 9, an employee at a Florida business ran out to his car, grabbed his gun, then   the business and confronted an alleged “active shooter,” stopping him “in his tracks. ”[The incident occurred at BL Landscaping in Jacksonville, where police say the alleged “active shooter” is “not a US citizen. ”  According to CBS 47,    Ezequiel Lopez allegedly opened fire on    Andrew Little because he thought “Little disrespected him. ” Police indicate that Lopez told them he allegedly planned the shooting because he felt Little “treated him differently that other employees. ” BL employee Joshua Curry ran to his car to retrieve his own gun after hearing shouts of “active shooter. ” He then ran back inside and confronted Lopez. WOKV reports that witnesses say Curry “stopped the shooter in his tracks. ” Curry said Lopez allegedly told him to drop the gun, but he refused. Curry said, “He’s like, ‘No, you need to put the gun down.’ I was like, ‘That’s not gonna happen man. It’s not. You just killed someone. I can’t take my gun off of you. I can’t. ’” Andrew Little died from a single gunshot wound to the back, and Lopez was charged with murder.
