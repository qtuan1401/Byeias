On April 6, the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA) issued a press release calling on the Democratic Party to practice what they preach and disarm guards and security at the upcoming Democratic Convention. [The convention will be held in Philadelphia July  .  According to the release, the CCRKBA wants “Democrats to gather at the Wells Fargo Center without the protection of armed police, Secret Service, or private security personnel. ” In other words, to gather in the same kind of   zone the Democratic Party keeps in place for kids and teachers in elementary schools across the country. CCRKBA Chairman Alan Gottlieb said: Democrats have become known as the party of gun control. Virtually all recent gun control proposals at the federal and state levels have been launched and championed by Democrats. It’s time for the party to “put up or shut up” about guns. The best way to do that is to forsake armed security during the convention. Gottlieb added, “If a political party believes guns do not make us safer, they should set an example by rejecting any and all forms of armed security at their national convention. ” He said, “No group, organization or political party that makes erosion of a constitutionally delineated fundamental civil right part of its agenda should benefit in any way from the existence of that right. ” CCRKBA has also launched a petition seeking to gather signatures in support of banning guns at the Democratic National Convention.
