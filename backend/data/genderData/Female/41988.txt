 (CNN) Actor Vince Vaughn says he supports guns in schools to prevent mass shootings, detailing his stance in an interview in British GQ’s July issue.  Vaughn, star of screwball comedies such as ”Wedding Crashers,” ”Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” and ”Starsky  Hutch,” came out full force in favor of the Second Amendment.  ”I support people having a gun in public full stop, not just in your home,” Vaughn said. ”We have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government. ”It’s well known that the greatest defense against an intruder is the sound of a gun hammer being pulled back.” Schools without guns are targets for mass shooters, he said.  ”In all of our schools it is illegal to have guns on campus, so again and again these guys go and shoot up these f***ing schools because they know there are no guns there,” he said. ”They are monsters killing   . ”You think the politicians that run my country and your country don’t have guns in the schools their kids go to?” he asked. ”They do. And we should be allowed the same rights.” Banning guns won’t stop criminals, he said. ”Banning guns is like banning forks in an attempt to stop making people fat. Taking away guns, taking away drugs, the booze, it won’t rid the world of criminality.” The social media debate has already begun, with @mydaughtersarmy tweeting, ”You’re afraid we will take away your guns. We’re afraid your guns will take away our children. We haven’t taken any of your guns. Your guns have taken too many of our children. Whose fears are unfounded?” But ”Hands Off My Gun” author Dana Loesch called Vaughn’s critics ”crybabies.” Vaughn has spoken publicly of his libertarian political philosophy in the past, endorsing Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul in 2011.
