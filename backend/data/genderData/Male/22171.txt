Senator Marco Rubio reacted to North Korea’s claim that it has tested a hydrogen bomb after seismic activity was detected within the dictatorship state. [“I have been warning throughout this campaign that North Korea is run by a lunatic who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama has stood idly by,” the Republican presidential candidate said in a statement issued moments after the news broke.  Rubio explained in his statement that enemies of the United States continued to Obama’s weakness, calling for new leadership to stand up to world dictators. “If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed   foreign policy,” he said. Rubio specifically criticized Obama and Hillary for failing to address North Korea in an ad released in December.
