During the Saturday broadcast of “Justice” on Fox News Channel, host Judge Jeanine Pirro urged President Barack Obama to take his focus away from removing guns and instead, using guns to take down terrorists.  Pirro said Obama is “  in the leftist political ideology” when it comes to gun control, while he should be focused on protecting Americans and letting them defend themselves. “Mr. President, the issue is terrorism, not mass shootings. And yet, because of a political agenda, you refuse to the biggest danger that we face. Instead of blaming guns, why don’t you start shooting terrorists? Now, maybe you don’t have time to focus on this because you’re too busy emptying Guantanamo and trading deserters for Taliban generals. And as a result of your   in the leftist political ideology, you should be focused on protecting us and letting us defend ourselves. The police cannot do it all. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
