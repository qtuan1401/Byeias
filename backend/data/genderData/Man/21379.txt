At a free speech symposium at the University of Missouri, CNN commentator Sally Kohn argued that   speech conservatives are really just afraid of the increasing desire for multiculturalism on college campuses. [Kohn, who frequently appears as a progressive commentator on CNN, claimed at the symposium that the right, by fighting for free speech, has merely been seeking new ways to stifle calls for diversity, particularly on college campuses.  Kohn argued that   speech conservatives are really just afraid of “multiculturalism. ”   Kohn’s CNN colleague Kirsten Powers challenged her, arguing that “speech is not in itself dangerous. ” Kohn responded that their white,   class backgrounds disqualify them from deciding if free speech is harmful. “Feelings are valid,” Kohn declared. “I’m never going to argue with people’s feelings. ” “If they feel like they can no longer speak against positive social change, good,” Kohn said of conservatives who are silenced on college campuses. “They think [diversity] is dumbing down humanity, or the greatness and exceptionalism of America. I’m happy that’s under assault. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
