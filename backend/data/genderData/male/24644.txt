Former wrestling champion Hulk Hogan has bought a new $1. 6 million beach house after winning $140 million in his lawsuit against Gawker earlier this year. [The   2, 000 square foot cottage, which includes a beachfront deck and panoramic views of the beach, is located beside Hogan’s $3 million mansion in Clearwater, Florida, which he purchased in 2014.  Hogan was awarded $140 million in March, after winning a lawsuit against Gawker Media, who posted a clip from Hogan’s sex tape without his permission. It was later revealed that PayPal   Peter Thiel funded Hogan’s lawsuit against the company, after Gawker publicly outed Thiel as a homosexual in 2007 against his will. “I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest,” said Thiel to the New York Times in May. Both Gawker Media and its founder Nick Denton were forced to file for bankruptcy after the court ruling, and Gawker Media has since been bought by Univision, who made it their first act to shut down the media company’s main controversial site, Gawker, before renaming themselves as Gizmodo Media. Since filing for bankruptcy, Denton was denied the ability to lease his $4. 25 million apartment in Manhattan, and he has since moved into a cheaper property.
