President Barack Obama penned a column for Glamour magazine declaring that he is a feminist, and urging all men to join him. [Citing his own two daughters, Obama explained that it was important for them to see their dad as someone who supports them in the face of challenges that they face as women.  “Yes, it’s important that their dad is a feminist, because now that’s what they expect of all men,” he wrote in an essay running more than 1, 500 words. Obama complained that there were still so many “gender stereotypes” in today’s culture, an issue that he grew more sensitive about as a father. “[Y]ou become even more aware of how gender stereotypes pervade our society,” he said. “You see the subtle and    social cues transmitted through culture. ” He also complained that his wife Michelle Obama was unfairly portrayed as being too angry, when she was First Lady and acted differently than previous spouses of the presidency. “We need to keep changing a culture that shines a particularly unforgiving light on women and girls of color,” he wrote. Obama pointed out that when he was younger, his wife Michelle Obama took the majority of the responsibilities of raising the children, which he now realizes was not fair. “I can look back now and see that, while I helped out, it was usually on my schedule and on my terms,” he wrote. “The burden disproportionately and unfairly fell on Michelle. ” Obama didn’t miss the opportunity to point out that Hillary Clinton’s nomination for president was a “historic” moment for women. “No matter your political views, this is a historic moment for America,” he said. “And it’s just one more example of how far women have come on the long journey toward equality. ”
