 (CNN) Kevin Smith has a message for cyberbullies: Do something with your life.  The actor furiously took to Instagram on Tuesday to slam who he calls internet ”trolls” for posting hateful things under his    daughter, Harley Quinn Smith’s pictures.  ”If you hate me (or my kid) this much, the better use of your time is to make YOUR dreams come true, instead of slamming others for doing the same,” Smith wrote alongside a screengrab of the vicious comment left by one user in particular.  ”The best revenge is living insanely well    so if you wanna get back at a 17 year old girl for the grievous crime of enjoying her life, the best way to do it is to succeed in your OWN existence. Show the world WHY we should be paying attention to you instead of anyone else,” Smith continued. Smith added that ”attacking teen girls on the internet is the saddest form of masturbation that exists and requires no discernible skill or talent.” Related Link: Clinton’s advice on cyberbullying: ’Don’t take it personally’ He ended by plugging his upcoming movie ”Yoga Hosers,” which premieres in September.
