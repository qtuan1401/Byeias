’  ’ ”   On the whole, Robert De Niro’s acting career has been   illustrious, bolstered by two Academy Awards and a string of   great roles in classic movies. ” ”   But after a certain point, his roles in numerous critical   catastrophes, like this year’s  have seemed to point toward a trend that   many moviegoers have quietly noted for years: It seems as if   Robert De Niro has stopped caring about the films he appears in. ” ’   This is the driving sentiment behind a humorous chart created by   . The chart graphs the Rotten   Tomatoes scores for all of the movies De Niro has appeared in   over the course of his   career and concludes that the   actor ”stopped caring” after the release of his 2002 film   ”Showtime.” ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tPeople say data analysis is boring, but you can calculate the exact moment that Robert De Niro stopped caring (2002)  ’ ’   As one  Chapman’’s graph mistakenly labels all   Rotten Tomatoes scores above 50% as ”fresh,” when, in fact, only   movies with a critical response of 60% or above are given that   designation. ’ ’   So the year De Niro actually stopped caring was 1998,   following his appearance in Quentin Tarantino’’s critically   acclaimed crime thriller ”Jackie Brown.” ’ ’   Either way, we’’re hoping that De Niro’’s future in film includes   more ”Silver Linings Playbook”  movies and less ”Little   Fockers.” ’
