A man dressed in a clown suit attempted to kidnap a    girl from her mother’s arms while the duo were seated at a bus stop in Concord, California, around 1:00 p. m. on Wednesday afternoon. [“He was smiling at her, sitting there with us,” the mother said of the clown, according to Bay Area News Station KRON4And then he grabbed her hand. He said ‘awwww’ and he tried to pull. Once he grabbed. And I pulled back and I kicked the sh*t out of him,” she said.  The clown man reportedly ran away and she called 911. Concord Police arrived on scene, but the man had fled the scene on foot. He is described as a white male with blue eyes and wearing a partial clown costume, including a blue wig, a rainbow and a polka dot suit, but with tennis shoes and without a painted face. The incident took place at Willow Pass Road and Waterworld Parkway. Officers are now reportedly searching the area for the clown. Meanwhile, just over an hour away in Galt, an    boy was reportedly chased down by two clowns around 1:15 p. m. on Wednesday afternoon. According to local NBC affiliate KCRA, the little boy was chased on his way home from school. The incident reportedly happened near Lake Canyon Elementary School. The fourth grader was not hurt. These two incidents arrive just one day after pranksters used “creepy” clowns to issue false death threats against several Northern California schools over Instagram, prompting an increase in police presence near the schools. An interactive map provided by the San Jose Mercury News plots out all the places throughout the United States that recent clown sightings have been made. Strange clowns have been seen and reported in Oregon, California, Texas, Kansas, Alabama, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. Elsewhere, a young woman in Arizona has organized a “Clown Lives Matter” rally that is scheduled to take place on October 15 in Tucson, in reaction to a series of creepy   incidents that have gained traction on both social media and in the news. NBC News notes that a flyer advertising the event writes “this is a peaceful way to show clowns are not psycho killers. We want the public to feel safe, and not be afraid. So come out, bring the family, meet a clown and get a hug!” The march will take place at 6:30 p. m. at the parking lot of Maloney’s Tavern, located on 213 N. 4th Avenue. “We’re just going to gather together and walk peacefully and pass out balloon animals and flowers and give out free hugs,” the woman said. She added that she also wanted to spread the message that there are some people who dress up as clowns in order to make a living. Some people made political light of the #ClownLivesMatter hashtag over social media: How dare anyone think all lives matter? #clownlivesmatter pic. twitter.   —   Sarah Connor (@ConstitutionLo1) October 6, 2016,  It feels great to know that I can wear my costume in public and have the support of my brothers. #ClownLivesMatter pic. twitter.   —   Karas (@TheRealKaras) October 6, 2016,  #ClownLivesMatter  but not the creepy ones! #KaineWreck #Clown #candyKaine #VPDebate https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   BenGarrison Cartoons (@GrrrGraphics) October 6, 2016,  Photo: file, Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz
