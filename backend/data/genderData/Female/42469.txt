Washington (CNN) South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham picked up the phone Saturday afternoon to hear a familiar voice on the other end: that of Hillary Clinton. The Democratic presidential candidate told the Republican presidential candidate that she was reaching out to extend her condolences on the tragedy in his home state. ”She said she was calling to see how I was doing, and wanted to let me know that she was thinking about me and about everyone in South Carolina,” Graham told CNN, recounting the telephone conversation. He said he was ”pleasantly surprised” to get the call    mostly because he knows how busy she is. ”I know firsthand how hard it is to run for president,” Graham said. Although Graham, like other GOP presidential candidates, regularly blasts Clinton on the campaign trail, the two actually had a good relationship while serving with one another in the Senate. They traveled together as members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and even   legislation to give military reservists health benefits. ”She is a nice person,” Graham said. ”I told her that the call meant a lot to me, and would mean a lot to the people of South Carolina. It is a tough weekend for all of us,” he added.
