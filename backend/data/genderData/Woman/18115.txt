Former President George W. Bush issued a statement in reaction to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia from his ranch:[Laura and I mourn the death of a brilliant jurist and important American, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. He was a towering figure and important judge on our Nationâ€™s highest court. He brought intellect, good judgement, and wit to the bench, and he will be missed by his colleagues and our country. Laura and I send our heartfelt sympathies and condolences to his wife, Maureen, their nine children, and the entire Scalia family.
