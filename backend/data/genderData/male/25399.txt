Southern California gang members were given orders to break into homes daily and return to their leaders with “at least $5, 000 and a weapon every single day,” according to law enforcement. [The daily burglary quota was discovered after officials made 15 arrests in “a   burglary ring that they say hit thousands of SoCal homes. ” The homes were in “upscale neighborhoods in Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. ”  According to ABC 7, the gang members involved in the burglary ring allegedly “[struck] homes four to five times in a week” and “are suspected of some 5, 000 burglaries” in total. It took eighteen different police departments and “400” individual law enforcement personnel “three and half years  …    to track the burglary suspects back to the ringleaders. ” Many of the suspects have been in and out of jail multiple times. “Law enforcement officials blame the short sentences on a new state law designed to reduce prison overcrowding” but believe longer sentences will result from the latest arrests because of the compounding nature of   charges.
