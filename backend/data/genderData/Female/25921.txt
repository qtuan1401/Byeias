The WWF  —   the world’s richest environmental lobby group  —   has announced that Britain should remain in the European Union. [“The safer option for our wildlife and environment is for the UK to remain within the EU,” it says in a joint statement issued with another   conservation charity, the RSPB.  But could it be, perhaps, that what these charities appreciate best of all about the EU is the vast amounts of money it pays them? As we reported earlier, between 2007 and 2012 the EU paid the RSPB €14 million (over £10 million) in funds. The WWF has done even better out of this cosy relationship. In the same period, as Richard North has reported, it manage to grab itself €53, 813, 343 (over £40 million) for its services to itself and the EU empire. So, between them, the WWF and the RSPB have been snaffling £10 million a year from the EU  —   as a reward for all the lobbying they do on its behalf. But at least, in return for all this money, we get a safer, cleaner environment, right? Not necessarily. In fact, I’d say almost certainly not. The WWF and the RSPB parted company with the interests of the environment and nature quite some time ago  —   as I’ll explain in my next piece. Meanwhile, let’s just dwell on that those €50 million  —   the equivalent of around $56 million. Hell, if you paid my organisation that kind of money to lobby for Remain, I think even I might be able to find one or two reasons why this suicidally wrong idea made some kind of sense.
