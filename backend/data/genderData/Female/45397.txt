’Limited Too represents a simple time in my life  —   a time with ”As Long as You Love Me” by the Backstreet Boys and ”Spice Up Your Life” by the Spice Girls as its soundtrack. A time illustrated by butterfly hair clips and glitter. A time when I was in a girl group with my friends called Peppermint with a song that we sang at my birthday party called ”Slam It Down. ”’ ’A time that, while devoid of   conflict like a   metabolism and financial responsibilities, is still a time to which I would not go back, given the opportunity.’ ’But it appears that the retailer is banking on the fact that many other women will.’ ”Limited Too, the clothing purveyor of many millennial women’s youths, is  much to the delight of the internet. The company, which had around 600 stores at its peak and was later soaked into Justice, was acquired by Bluestar Alliance this past summer.

It’s coming  —   release the glitter!” ”That, at least, is the reaction the news of the store’s return garnered. The young, female, exuberant subsector of the internet was exhilarated when this news came out last summer.” ’’ ’’ ’ ’t’t’tLIMITED TOO IS COMING BACK IN 2016 SO WE ALL KNOW WHERE TO GO TO GET OVERPRICED JEANS AND SPARKLY LIP GLOSS’t’t’ ” ’t’t’tNot even gonna lie my inner six year old is very excited to hear that ’Limited Too!’ Is coming back. .😏’t’t” ’ ’t’t’tLIMITED TOO IS COMING BACK😭❤️’t’t’ ’”Nostalgia marketing is . .. an effective strategy to engage with millennials,” Ruth Bernstein, c Business Insider. ”Millennials tend to look inwards  —   we joke that they’’re narcissists, but it’’s true they want to see things that reflect them, and they like looking back at their own lives.

And would the same millennial moms  —   ones that call themselves ”feminists”  —   dress their daughters in those shirts?’ ’’ ’In order to really succeed, Limited Too needs to be looking forward, rather than just digging up glittery skeletons from the past.’ ’”There’’s an opportunity for Limited Too to reclaim a space in the market for tween [and] teen shopping.
