Throughout MSNBC’s news coverage of Thursday’s Dallas shooting that has so far resulted in the deaths of at least five police officers, MSNBC’s breaking news anchor Brian Williams, formerly the anchor of NBC’s “Nightly News,” went out of his way on repeated occasions to tie the incident to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  Williams latest reference came in a segment with current “Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt on Friday afternoon. “[T]here is history behind all of us,” Williams said. “I’m thinking back to 1963 where the thorough will modern city of Dallas was anxious to show itself off, anxious, though not all were at the time to host President Kennedy. They have no way of knowing they were about to have a president from Texas after the horrible assassination that took place in Dallas, and that’s what the association was for so many people with Dallas, TX  —   Dealey Plaza, the book depository not at all far from the gunfire last night. Dallas has worked with mightily as part of the   Worth Metroplex to become know for something else and now this parasitism of violence. ” Watch: OO. ready( function()  ) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
