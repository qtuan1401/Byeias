You can’t just convert overnight to a religion. ” That month, Lohan told the New York Post that she was racially profiled for the first time in her life at London’s Heathrow Airport, where she was traveling while wearing an Islamic headscarf. The actress said she wears the headscarf out of “respect” for certain countries to which she travels. In recent months, Lohan has been busy with her advocacy work on behalf of Syrian refugees. The actress met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inside the country’s presidential palace in January, and has previously visited with refugees in hospitals and homes in Istanbul. The “burkini”  swimsuit has previously been at the center of some controversy last year, authorities in the French town of Nice banned the garment, reportedly claiming it posed a risk to public order. A court in Nice later overturned the ban.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
