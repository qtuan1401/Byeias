Thursday on the House floor while speaking against the Sunshine For Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, Rep. Hank Johnson ( ) decried the “free market way of thinking. ”  Johnson said, “There has been a movement over the last 30, 40 years to turn people against the government. This mantra is that government is too big, we don’t need any rules to govern human conduct, let everything work itself out and the free market system will make it rain for everybody. Well, we’ve seen after 30, 40 years of practicing that free market way of thinking, that it doesn’t work. ” He added “This is what this legislation is about —  is gutting the   process. This is one of many attempts —  incessant attempts —  by my friends on the other side to try and cut government and so that their friends in big business on Wall Street can make it rain for the rest of us. But they don’t make it rain for anybody but themselves. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
