”   US gymnast Danell Leyva had a brutal fall during his     routine in the men’s gymnastics final. ” ’   With the US mounting a comeback, though still unlikely to medal,   Leyva was in the midst of a strong routine when, on a release, he   lost his grip and fell to the ground. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   It was a brutal moment for him. After falling, he stayed on the   ground for several moments: ’ ’  ’ ’   He walked off the mat, gutted: ’ ’  ’ ”   The moment made it all the more difficult for Leyva. After a slow   start, the US had posted eight straight scores of 15 or better,   . Though a medal was a long shot,   the US certainly wouldn’t have objected to a better overall   finish, and had Leyva finished his routine strong, then the US   might have had a shot with a little help from another team. ” ’   McCarvel reported that Leyva was emotional afterward: ’ ’ ’ ” ’t’t’tLeyva walks to corner of gym and Yin Alvarez, his coach & stepdad, is there. They hug 2Xs, Danell resting his head on Y’s shoulder  ” ”   As  the loss was hardly Leyva’s   fault, particularly after a slow start elsewhere, but it was the   end to their final. ” ’   Japan took the gold, Russia the silver, and China the bronze   in the final, with the US finishing fifth. ’
