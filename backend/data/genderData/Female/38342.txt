 (CNN) While ”taking the waters” may have fallen out of favor, a new generation of architects are reimagining the bathhouse as an alternative community space. ”Soak, Steam, Dream”    an exhibition at the Roca London Gallery    brings together contemporary bathhouses by designers from around the world, including mobile    and floating spas perched on lakes. While historically bathhouses were a place of health and   slowly displaced by the private bathroom, many of the spas on show were created with socializing in mind. ”Architects want an alternative to our existing bars and restaurants, and other   social spaces,” says curator Jane Withers. ”It’s about how people behave, and sparking community in different ways.” For more architecture stories, head to The Spaces.
