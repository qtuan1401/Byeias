In an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “America’s News HQ” on Sunday, Rep. Louis Gohmert ( ) said that if anyone interfered with the 2016 presidential election, it wasn’t the Russians but the Department of Justice.  He specifically named former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former FBI Director James Comey. Gohmert referred to Comey’s testimony last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee where he said Lynch had told him to refer to the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information as a “matter,” rather than an “investigation,” even though Clinton was under investigation. Comey said that led him to publicly announce the end of the Clinton investigation in July 2016. “At best, it was an attempt to manipulate the election, not by the Russians in this case, but by the Department of Justice  —   the Attorney General herself  —   because that came from Comey,”  Gohmert said. “[Comey] totally ruined his own credibility  —   or what was left of it,” Gohmert said. “He did vast damage and raised big red flags and questions over Loretta Lynch’s job as head of the Justice Department. “[Lynch] was using her official position to help the campaign of Hillary Clinton and that didn’t seem to bother him enough to do a memo,” Gohmert said. Gohmert said this should be the subject of a congressional investigation. “We need to round up all those people [Comey] talked to  —   because we have a conspiracy remaining afoot in the Department of Justice that is going to be out to destroy this president and they’ve got to be fired if not worse. ” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter @PennyStarrDC
