”When the 5G wireless standard hits the mainstream, our home internet speeds have the potential to be so fast that we’ll be downloading 4K movies, games, software, and any other large form of content at a fraction of the time we’re used to.” ’’ ’’ ”At Mobile World Congress this year, Samsung showcased its 5G Home Routers, which achieved speeds of up to 4    (Gbps) according to . That’s 500    which could let you download a 50GB game in under two minutes, or a 100GB 4K movie in under four minutes.” ’’ ’To give you an idea of how fast that is, the  in the US as of 2016 is 55    which translates to a woeful 6. 5   .’ ’’ ’Still, even with 50% of that performance, we could be experiencing 2Gbps speeds at home. And even 1Gbps  —   25% of the perfect scenario  —   would be great compared the US internet speed average.’ ’’ ’’ ’Samsung’’s 5G Home Router will use an antenna installed outside of one of your home’’s windows, which is connected to a WiFi router inside your home.

At the moment, Verizon is testing 5G in a few parts of the US, and the the overall consensus for mainstream 5G is around 2020.” ”There’s no indication of how much these routers and other equipment will cost, nor how much the internet plans will cost, either.
