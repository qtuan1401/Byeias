MLB Hall of Famer and former Chicago White Sox first baseman Frank Thomas weighed in on Tim Tebow’s baseball career, and “The Big Hurt” thinks Tebow, a Heisman winner at the University of Florida, is an even better baseball player than he was a football player.  “I think Tim Tebow was a better baseball player than he was a football player. I think Urban Meyer kept Tim Tebow from playing baseball at the University of Florida. He was a heck of a high school baseball player,” Thomas said. “Urban loves him and would not let him play college baseball. I think Tim Tebow’s a better baseball player than he was football player. ” Thomas added later in the interview that he believes Tebow will be able to make it to the big leagues one day.
