President Barack Obama pardoned a turkey Wednesday afternoon, wishing all Americans a Happy Thanksgiving. [He also listed a number of things the people had to be thankful for, including Obamacare.  “Our uninsured rate is an   low thanks to the 20 million more Americans, including millions of children, who finally know the security of health insurance,” he said. “That’s worth gobbling about. ” Since it was his last time pardoning the presidential turkey, Obama took the opportunity to boast about his record as president. He touted six straight years of job creation, bragging that it was “the longest streak ever,” and cited low unemployment numbers, rising wages, the stock market tripling, and an   high rate of high school graduations. Obama also cited “marriage equality” being the law of the land  —   as another reason why Americans should be thankful  —   as well as more American soldiers being home for Thanksgiving. “Thanksgiving is also a reminder of the source of our national strength, that out of many we are one, and we’re bound not by race or religion but adherence to a common creed, that all of us are created equal,” he said. Obama pardoned the turkeys with two of his nephews, as his daughters Sasha and Malia apparently opted out of the presidential tradition. The turkey, named “Tater” by schoolchildren in Iowa, flapped its wings after it was pardoned by the president.
