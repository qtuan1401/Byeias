The latest stop on Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa‘s “High Road Tour” saw nearly a dozen underage revelers rushed to the hospital for alcohol poisoning and more than 50 people removed from the Nikon at Jones Beach Amphitheater in Wantagh, New York Tuesday night. [At least eleven concertgoers were taken to area hospitals for treatment, law enforcement officers said, according to Page Six. Several victims were underage, including an    male who was reportedly so drunk that he broke his nose on the ground after he passed out.  In all, 25 of the 35 people treated for alcohol poisoning were underage, according to TMZ, Police at the event also arrested four people for possession of marijuana. Witnesses said police were forced to shut down the restrooms 20 minutes into the show after finding several underage fans drinking vodka out of water bottles. Officers were forced to call the parents of those underage drinkers who were not taken to the hospital. Tuesday’s incident came less than a week after dozens of people were injured at a Camden, New Jersey stop on Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa’s tour. As many as 42 people were injured after a metal barrier collapsed while Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa were on stage performing, sending audience members crashing into the concrete in front of the stage.
