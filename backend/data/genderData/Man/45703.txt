”There was a lot of smirking and   during Thursday’s congressional hearing on   pricing.” ’And nobody who was testifying was immune to either.’ ’Martin Shkreli, who used his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, was dismissed a few minutes in. But the former pharmaceutical executive, who became infamous for raising the price of a critical drug by 5, 000% still had his voice heard through his  and video clips used at the hearing.’ ’With Congress taking charge and industry leaders in the hot seat, a lot was said.’ ”Some members of Congress weren’t exactly up to speed with the    intricacies of the healthcare industry, though with props and shouting, they were able to get some interesting points across during the hearing:” ”It’s a complicated system  —   one that’s easy to get upset about  —   and the    hearing is only just the beginning of this discussion. From pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefits managers to hospitals and the FDA and the Congress that funds it, there will be a lot of kinks to work out in the system before  are closed.”
