NEW YORK  —   Kathleen Willey, one of the women who famously accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, used a radio interview on Sunday to call on other possible alleged female victims of Bill Clinton to contact her, and to “find the bravery and the courage to come forward. ”[Stated Willey:  “I am just pleading with any woman who has been raped, almost raped, assaulted, harassed by Bill Clinton to just please try to find the bravery and the courage to come forward to help us. We don’t have the feminists, the quote unquote feminists behind us. There are no female Hillary fans behind us at all. They seem to overlook these crimes and these felonies. “And you just want to say, what would you do if it happened to you? What would you do if it happened to you or your daughter?   …     Where would you go? “I’ve given people a place to go to tell their story.   …     I guarantee their anonymity 100 percent. And if they just want to tell their story and get it off their chests because they have been carrying it around their whole lives and blaming themselves just please just find the courage to do that. That’s all that I am asking women to do. ” Speaking on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, Willey announced that other possible alleged victims can reach her at the contact form on her website, AScandalADay. com. “I can’t imagine the hundreds of women who are out there who have been assaulted by him. And I do mean hundreds, if not thousands,” she added. Willey has issued such public calls several times over the past few months.
