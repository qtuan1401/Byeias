Firefighters were still on the scene Friday night and no injuries or fatalities were confirmed.  It’s not known how many people were in the aircraft. The Cessna Citation I is a small jet, according to the Cessna website. Neighborhood resident John Perry said he noticed his neighbors ”were looking up in the sky and I see a plane going straight down, it was going down in a corkscrew fashion, it was really slow, I couldn’t hear an engine,” according to CNN affiliate WAGA. FAA spokesman Rick. Breitenfeldt said the FAA will investigate. The National Transportation Safety Board will determine the cause of the crash.
