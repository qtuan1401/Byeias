Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” while discussing San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem at his preseason football games to protest police treatment of minorities,   Whoopi Goldberg invoked the Black Power salute during the 1968 Olympics by U. S. medalists John Carlos and Tommie Smith during their medal ceremony.  Goldberg said, “Listen, people have been protesting, you know, be they athletes who won gold medals who stood on the podium and did this, you know there have always been. The bitch is we’re still protesting the same thing. That’s the awful part. So people find the way they can do it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
