”It may be tough to run a hedge fund, but that isn’t stopping   folks from trying to branch out on their own.” ”Here’s a short and nonexhaustive list of some of the top new funds to have come across our radar.” ”The competition to raise assets is steep, particularly for startups that don’t have long performance track records to woo investors. Instead, new managers often rely on the pedigrees of their previous employers and the backing of    investment titans to sway potential investors to open their checkbooks.” ’Recent data is not the most promising, however, with more hedge funds closing than opening. In 2015, 979 hedge funds closed their doors while 968 opened. This year through the first quarter, 291 have shut while 206 opened, Hedge Fund Research data shows.’ ”But the glory of raising assets, running one’s own proper business and investment strategy, and the (potentially very lucrative) benefit of charging high fees are alluring. At the moment, the global hedge fund industry is managing close to its peak in assets, at about $2. 9 trillion, HFR says.” ’To the new startups, bon courage.’
