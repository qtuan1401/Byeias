 (CNN) He’s making a list and he’s checking it twice    but Santa Claus will have to wait for the transfer window if he’s to shower his own football club with presents. That’s right, the man in the big red suit with the bushy beard is a fan of a team in the northern Finnish city of Rovaniemi    and it’s called FC Santa Claus. While Santa is busy all year round preparing for his travels across the globe, he still has time to sled down to the Rovaniemen Keskuskenttä stadium. Rovaniemi is situated on the Arctic Circle at the heart of the Barents region, some 835 km from the capital Helsinki. An estimated 65, 000 people live in Rovaniemi, which has been the administrative center of Lapland since 1938. Over 500, 000 visitors travel to Finland’s most northern province each year to meet Santa and experience the captivating scenery.
