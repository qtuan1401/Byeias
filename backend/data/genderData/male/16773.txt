Tuesday on Newsmax TV’s “The Steve Malzberg Show,” the chairman of a House subcommittee on   Rep. Peter King ( ) said the terror attacks in Brussels at the Maalbeek Metro station and and Zaventem airport, which resulted in deaths of at least 31 and hundreds injured, prove that the Islamic State (ISIS) was “an enemy which is willing and able to strike at almost any time. ”  King said, “It is horror and if there is anything positive that can come out of a tragedy such as this —  is possibly a   call to people that the enemy is Islamist terrorism, that’s going to be here for a long time —  that we can’t be shaking hands with it or be nice to them and hope it will go away. This is an enemy which is willing and able to strike at almost any time. And that’s were we need leadership. That’s were we need the American president to show leadership, rather than watching a baseball game in Cuba. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN,
