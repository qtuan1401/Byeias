On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Huffington Post Senior Politics Editor Sam Stein stated that he doesn’t think fake news “contributed” to Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s loss.  Stein said, “I don’t think fake news contributed to her loss. I’m not saying that. ” He added that “I think it played a role in the conversation of the election. I don’t think that’s disputable. ” And that fake news is a “big problem. ”   Mika Brzezinski and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough pushed back that fake news has been a problem for years, and isn’t a new phenomenon. Scarborough added that Clinton lost Clinton the election, not fake news.   Willie Geist later added that he hasn’t “seen a lot of signs” that Democrats have learned from 2016, and they appear to be “doubling down” and “blaming other things that perhaps didn’t have as much influence on the election as they believe they did. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
