 (CNN) The Chicago Bears fired defensive end Ray McDonald on Monday after his arrest on domestic violence and child endangerment charges in Santa Clara, California.  The Bears had taken a chance on McDonald, who was released by the San Francisco 49ers last year amid allegations of sexual assault. That same year, McDonald was also arrested in a domestic violence case against his pregnant fiancee. Prosecutors dropped the charges for lack of evidence.  On Monday morning, Santa Clara police officers responded to a disturbance call before dawn at a residence.  McDonald was not there, put officers learned that McDonald allegedly ”physically assaulted the victim while she was holding a baby,” police said in a statement.  The    pro football player was arrested hours later in San Jose, police said.  By Monday afternoon, the Bears announced they released McDonald.  ”We believe in second chances, but when we signed Ray, we were very clear what our expectations were if he was to remain a Bear,” General Manager Ryan Pace said in a statement. ”He was not able to meet the standard, and the decision was made to release him.”
