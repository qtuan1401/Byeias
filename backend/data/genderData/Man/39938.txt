 (CNN) She says she was just 18 when Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion. On Wednesday, Chloe Goins, now 24, told her story to investigating officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. More than 20 women have come forward with claims of sexual assault against the comedian. Many of the accusations date back decades. No charges have been filed against Cosby, and his attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations. ”These victims are brave, smart, sophisticated women, who for many years have lived with this secret,” said Spencer Kuvin, Goins’ attorney. ”Mr. Cosby should and will be held accountable for what he’s done.” Kuvin believes his client may be the first accuser to have a case that falls within the statute of limitations for bringing criminal charges. He declined to go into specifics of what Goins says happened between Cosby and her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. ”She was drugged. She doesn’t know what happened, she blacked out and woke up finding Mr. Cosby over her as she was in a state of complete undress,” he said. ”I don’t want to go into details about what he was doing, and I don’t believe any of these cameras can actually publish what he was doing,” Kuvin told reporters. An attorney for Cosby did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday on the latest allegation. Woman alleges Cosby raped her and other Playboy bunnies
