A British police officer was allegedly strangled, dismembered, and eaten with chopsticks by his date who he met on the gay dating app Grindr. [Stefano Brizzi is accused of trying to cook PC Gordon Semple’s body parts, after his DNA was found inside of a pot and on some chopsticks at Brizzi’s residence.  The remains of Semple’s body were found dissolving in a bath of acid after neighbors reported “the smell of death” nearby to police officers. Brizzi asked police officers for a shower after he was caught, stating that his bath had “been unusable for days. ” Grindr, the most popular mobile app for homosexual dating, has been linked to crimes in the past along with the   Tinder, with Metro reporting in January that crimes related to the two apps had gone up by 700% in two years. “I thought I was getting away with it. All I have left is two buckets’ of PC Semple’s flesh,” Brizzi allegedly told police officers, before stating that he “just didn’t like” Semple. When one neighbor knocked on Brizzi’s door to complain about the smell, Brizzi also allegedly claimed that he was “cooking for a friend” before apologizing. Brizzi blamed the murder on Satan, claiming, “I spoke to Satan and he was telling me to kill, kill, kill and I agreed at the first opportunity. ” Earlier this month, Breitbart Tech reported that a man had been charged after his date from Tinder, another dating app, had fallen to her death from fourteen floors after he locked her out on his balcony following an argument. “You’re lucky I haven’t chucked you off my balcony,” said the man in an audio recording of the incident, before threatening, “If you try to pull anything, I’ll knock you out. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
