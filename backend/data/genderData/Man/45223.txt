’  ’ ’   Rep. Steve Scalise, who was shot in the hip Wednesday morning   when a gunman opened fire on a congressional baseball practice,   ”continues to show signs of improvement” after an additional   surgery on Saturday, the MedStar Washington Hospital said. ’ ’   He is now in serious condition, an improvement from the critical   condition he was in since his first surgery on Wednesday. ’ ’   ”He is more responsive, and is speaking with his loved ones. The   Scalise family greatly appreciates the outpouring of thoughts and   prayers,” the hospital’’s statement said. ’ ’ they were growing increasingly   confident and optimistic about his condition, though more   operations would be required and it was unclear how long he would   be hospitalized. ’ ’   Scalise was among three people shot by    James   Hodgkinson on Wednesday. The bullet that struck Scalise   ”travelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal   organs, and causing severe bleeding,” his doctors said. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tUpdate on the condition of Majority Whip Steve Scalise, courtesy of MedStar Washington Hospital Center:  ’ ’     ’ ’Rep.
