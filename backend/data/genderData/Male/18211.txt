Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) has proposed legislation that would forbid charitable foundations with connections to former public officials, including presidents, vice presidents, ambassadors, and former secretaries of state, from accepting donations from individuals or entities with ties to foreign governments. [“The corruptive influence of foreign money on our elected officials is evident, and we need to close this loophole,” Gohmert told Roll Call of the bill.  While Hillary Clinton’s name is not mentioned in the Texas Congressman’s legislation, an acronym derived from the bill’s official name  —   Contributions Legally Interdicted from Noncitizens to Our Nonprofits  —   clearly spells out CLINTON. Gohmert’s bill currently boasts one cosponsor, Rep. Pete Olson ( ). The bill would terminate the   status of a former public official’s   as a penalty if the organization “knowingly or willingly accepts or solicits any contribution from any person connected to a foreign government. ” The “Clinton Act of 2016” was introduced to Congress on June 24, nearly two weeks before FBI Director James Comey announced his decision not to recommend an indictment against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information during her tenure as secretary of state. Gohmert’s concern for “the corruptive influence of foreign money on our elected officials” was never more crucial than when applied to the disturbing pattern of   speaking fees to Bill Clinton and donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign contributors, coinciding with favors for Clinton cronies and foundation donors while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. “These donations are problematic, not only because they raise a question of whether foreign governments and nationals essentially bought access, but also because it creates the potential for a massive conflict of interest in the conduct of our nation’s foreign policy,” Gohmert said.
