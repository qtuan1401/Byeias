Rapper and TV personality Nick Cannon says he’s not surprised “cheating” Hillary Clinton lost the election, and accused Planned Parenthood of inflicting “real genocide” on black Americans. [“Hillary was sneaking and cheating,” Cannon said last week in an interview with “The Breakfast Club” radio show. “Think about all the stuff they did with Planned Parenthood and all that type of stuff. That type of stuff is to take our community  —   and forget gentrification, it’s real genocide, and it’s been like that for years. ”  Cannon says he love America, but believes its political system doesn’t benefit black voters. “This system is not built for us,” the America’s Got Talent host said. “This is not our land. I appreciate it. I love it, wouldn’t want to live nowhere else. But this wasn’t designed for our people. ” Cannon, an outspoken social justice activist, led a Black Lives Matter protest outside of the Republican National Convention in July. “We are going to be out here for the entire convention and make sure our voices are heard,” Cannon said, surrounded by several protesters holding signs reading, “I ain’t voting until #BlackLivesMatter. ” The    actor endorsed President Obama in 2008 and fundraised for him in 2012. But Cannon now seems skeptical that the Democratic and Republican Parties take black voters seriously. “Both [parties] aren’t speaking about our issues and they have been taking our votes for granted for far too long,” he told radio host Howard Stern in July. In March, Cannon released a video featuring his slam poetry, entitled, “Too Broke to Vote. ” “Nobody for president, that’s my campaign slogan,” he rhymes in the   music video.
