One of the unexpected byproducts of the streaming era is how a certain tier of artists  —   already famous, prone to eccentricity  —   have doubled down on albums. These blocks of work demand to be consumed as a whole, and serve as an enemy of the ephemerality of music consumption. This year, artists like Beyoncé, Bon Iver, Kanye West, Sturgill Simpson and Frank Ocean delivered albums that were meant to be taken in all at once, and pushed aesthetic boundaries while doing so. All of their albums appear on     lists from the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times  —   some on more than one. On this week’s Popcast, I speak with Jon Pareles, the chief pop music critic, and Joe Coscarelli, the pop music reporter, about the year’s best albums, the ones widely agreed on and the ones with more specific, narrow appeal.
