LONDON  —   Bernie Ecclestone’s longstanding leadership of Formula One ended when Liberty Media officially completed its takeover of the series on Monday and named Chase Carey, the vice chairman of 21st Century Fox, as Formula One’s new chief executive. The takeover came five days after the International Automobile Federation, the sport’s governing body, approved the sale of Formula One to Liberty Media, an American company that invests in entertainment and sports. Liberty said in a statement on Monday that the transaction price represented an enterprise value for Formula One of $8 billion and an equity value of $4. 4 billion. The    Ecclestone, who has been in charge of the series for nearly 40 years, will remain as an honorary chairman and will be an adviser to the circuit, according to Liberty. “I’m very pleased that the business has been acquired by Liberty,” Ecclestone said. “I am sure that Chase will execute his role in a way that will benefit the sport. ” Last September, Liberty Media Corp. which is controlled by the    tycoon John Malone, ended years of uncertainty about the ownership of Formula One when it announced plans for a takeover. Last week, the World Motor Sport Council of the F. I. A. as the governing body is known, approved the change of control of Delta Topco, the series’s holding company, from the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners to Liberty Media Group. With Liberty’s shareholders having approved the move, an F. I. A. green light was the last regulatory step before the sale. Although Carey had been expected to replace Ecclestone, the buyout came sooner than expected and some time ahead of the new Formula One season, which starts on March 26 with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.
