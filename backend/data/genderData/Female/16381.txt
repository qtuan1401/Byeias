Megastar singer and actress Jennifer Lopez will perform in Israel this summer, Ynet news reported. [ The    songstress will perform a single show in Tel Aviv, marking her first concert for Israeli fans.  J. Lo is joining other international pop stars set to perform in Israel this summer, including Elton John, SIA, Deep Purple, and Julio Iglesias. So far there have been no reports of pressure exerted on the star to cancel her trip. Musicians in support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, with Pink Floyd front man Roger Waters often at the helm, routinely try to prevent artists from performing in Israel. Lauryn Hill and Elvis Costello both caved in to the pressure, cancelling their gigs in Israel. Last week, British folk singer Donovan canceled a scheduled concert in Jaffa amid rumors of a boycott. Lopez is regarded as one of the U. S.â€™s most successful artists of Latin descent, selling nearly 60 million records.
