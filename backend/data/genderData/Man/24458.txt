Saturday on MSNBC’s “Melissa ” Ebony. com Senior Editor Jamilah Lemieux reacted to the fear illegal immigrants have in Flint, MI to ask for help during the water crisis because of possibly being deported.  According to Lemieux, Republicans have said they do not want to allow Muslims in the country, therefore they have no problem deporting anybody with brown skin. “You know what is one of the most terrifying moments for me is the possibility that a Republican could become the next president and that this precedent has been set by a Democrat  —   that we can come into your house at 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning while you’re asleep, take you and your family away so if a Democrat is doing that, what happens next when we have candidates that have said, ‘I’m not letting Muslims in, and I have no problem putting all of you brown people out. ’” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
