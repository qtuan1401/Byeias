At his father’s funeral Mass, Reverend Paul Scalia delivered a homily for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week at the age of 79.  Rev. Scalia spoke on his father’s “deep Catholic faith. ” “In the past week, many have recounted what dad did for them. But here, today, we recount what God did for dad how He blessed him,” Rev. Scalia said. He added, “God blessed dad with a deep Catholic faith: The conviction that Christ’s presence and power continue in the world today through His body, the Church. He loved the clarity and coherence of the church’s teachings. He treasured the church’s ceremonies, especially the beauty of her ancient worship the power of her sacraments as the means of salvation. ” Rev. Scalia also talked about Justice Scalia’s personal life, including his family. “We give thanks that Jesus bestowed upon him 55 years of marriage to the woman he loved, a woman who could match him at every step and even hold him accountable,” he explained. According to Scalia, his father mixed up the names of his nine children. “Sure, he forgot our names at times,” Rev. Scalia joked. “There are nine of us. ” Scalia also recalled when his father once realized that he was in his own son’s confession line, and quickly got out. “As he put it later, ‘like heck if I’m confessing to you.’ The feeling was mutual. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
