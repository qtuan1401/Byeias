Embattled senior Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin is set to host a   fashion fundraiser for the Democratic presidential candidate Thursday night. [The exclusive event will be held in the Washington home of Jefferson Hotel owner Connie Milstein and will be headlined by Vogue magazine    and fashion icon Anna Wintour and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, according to Bloomberg.  “Huma is beautiful, brilliant, and chic in the eyes of everyone who has worked with her,” Wintour said Wednesday in a statement. “Secretary Clinton has benefited from her support and wisdom for twenty years. ” Abedin, a longtime aide to Clinton, vanished from the campaign trail last week after the FBI announced that emails related to its Clinton private server investigation were found on a laptop shared by Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, who is being investigated for allegedly sending sexually explicit messages to a    girl. An Abedin aide insists that the Clinton confidant is continuing her campaign work from New York. “She is there in Brooklyn and happy to cooperate if they ever want to talk to her. She has been very cooperative throughout the process,” an Abedin aide told CNN Tuesday. The fashion fundraiser will be held at the Georgetown mansion of Milstein, who is a longtime Democratic donor. Clinton is not expected to be in attendance. In February, Wintour produced a “Made for History”   collection for Clinton’s campaign. Last month, Wintour’s Vogue magazine made its   endorsemenet of a presidential candidate, for Clinton. In September, von Furstenburg and her husband, billionaire IAC chairman Barry Diller, were set to host a $100, 000 per couple fundraiser for Clinton at their Beverly Hills home. Clinton cancelled her appearance at the fundraiser after falling ill with pneumonia.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
