SAN DIEGO (AP)  —   David Ortiz ended his   Game career with quite a walk off. [The popular Big Papi was embraced by nearly member of the American League roster Tuesday night when he was replaced by a pinch runner and strolled back to the dugout.  The    Boston designated hitter has said he will retire after this season. He leads the majors in slugging percentage,   average and   hits this year. Ortiz drew a walk in the third inning from Miami’s Jose Fernandez, who said a day earlier that he’d groove a pitch for the slugger. Ortiz kidded with Fernandez on his way to first base after taking ball four. A few moments after Ortiz reached first, AL manager Ned Yost sent in Edwin Encarnacion to run and Ortiz left to a nice ovation. He then hugged his teammates as they came out of the dugout to embrace him. Ortiz played in his 10th   Game. He grounded out hard in his first   in his finale.
