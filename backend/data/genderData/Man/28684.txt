Another spokesman, Mohammad Khurrassani, denied his group attacked the university.

Eastern). “There was heavy fog in the area when armed men entered   …     and started firing at the security guards, students and teachers,” stated regional police chief Saeed Wazir. Other witnesses said the gunmen screamed, “Allahu Akbar” while they fired upon innocent people. NBC journalists reported “parts of the   building were completely destroyed, with blood on the floor and bullet holes on the walls. ” *WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT* Contradictory claims from Pakistani Taliban over #BachaKhanUniversity attack: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   CNN International (@cnni) January 20, 2016,  Suicide attackers at #BachaKhanUniversity #Charsada pic. twitter.   —   Amer Khan (@KhanAmerKhan) January 20, 2016,  21+ students, 1 professor, 4 gunmen and 10+ civilians killed80+ injured#BachaKhanUniversity😞 #CharsaddaAttack pic. twitter. ”  —   sajjad iqbal (@seoboy77) January 20, 2016,  First pictures inside Pakistan university where Taliban executed at least 30 people https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) January 20, 2016,  “They shot [and] injured three security guards and one of them later went to block number one, another climbed to upper floor of the building and the third one went towards administration block,” said student Bakhtiar Khan.
