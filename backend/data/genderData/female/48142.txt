’  ’ ’   Bucket lists are usually dumb. ’ ’   They vacillate between the obvious and the pretentious. The   mile high club is gross. Burning Man is stupid. Mardi Gras is   overrated. Growing a beard takes no effort. I have no   interest to run with bulls or climb a mountain. And if I got   into a fight, I’d probably lose. ’ ’   But having spent the better part of my life as a gadabout, here   are the things I think every man should do at least once. ’ ’   1. Get in great shape. Don’t talk about it. ’ ’   2. Cook a gourmet meal for a group of close friends. ’ ’’ ’   3. Work as a bartender. ’ ’   4. Reward yourself for a big accomplishment with a big present   like a sports car or a nice watch. ’ ’   5. Swim naked, preferably not alone. ’ ’   6. Hire someone. ’ ’   7. Fire someone. ’ ’   8. Get drunk in Rangoon, Kashgar, Zanzibar, Kyoto, and Nashville. ’ ’   9. Adopt a pet. ’ ’   10. Buy a veteran a beer. ’ ’   11. Read The Brothers Karamazov and Don Quixote. ’ ’   12. Gallop on a horse. ’ ’   13. Shoot a machine gun. ’ ’   14. Tell one of your best friends that his fiancée is not the   right one. ’ ’   15. Stand up to a bully. ’ ’   16. Live in a foreign country. ’ ’   17. Take a big investment risk. ’ ’   18. Try [redacted]. ’ ’   19. Tell your partner what your bedroom fantasies really are. ’ ’   20. Buy a tuxedo before you are 30. Stay that size. (Hat tip:   @carney) ’ ’   21. Go to the Kentucky Derby, The Masters, Super Bowl, World Cup   or whatever your equivalent is. ’ ’   22. Race a car on a track. ’ ’   23. Surf. ’ ’   24. Help design and build your dream house. ’ ’   25. Lie when the truth is easier. ’ ’   26. Have kids. ’ ’   27. Go SCUBA diving. ’ ’   28. Sit front row, courtside, ringside, on the fifty, behind the   dugout, or backstage. Don’t Instagram it. ’ ’   29. Call someone you’ve wronged in the past. Apologize. ’ ’   30. Tip big enough to make the server’s month. ’ ’   31. Take a trip with your dad. ’ ’   32. Shake hands with the President. ’ ’   33. Lose your voice cheering for your favorite sports team. ’ ’   34. Accompany a close friend to chemotherapy. ’ ’   35. Teach your son the correct way to throw a baseball and a   spiral. ’ ’   36. Go drinking in Pat Pong (Bangkok). Don’t get blackout drunk.   Trust me. ’ ’   37. Spend a night in jail. Get the case dismissed. ’ ’   38. Make an enemy for life. ’ ’   39. Sail on the open ocean. ’ ’   40. Buy the bar a round. ’ ’   41. Cut down a tree. With an axe. ’ ’   42. Vacation alone. ’ ’   43. Join an adult sports league (not a fantasy league). ’ ’   44. Take a spontaneous international flight. Buy clothes when you   get there. ’ ’   45. Learn how to fly fish. It’s cheaper than a therapist. ’ ’   46. Spend some time in a third world country. Remember, that’s   how most of the world live out the entirety of their short   lives. ’ ’   47. Sleep under the stars. On purpose. Preferably by a fire. ’ ’   48. Coach your kid’s sports team. ’ ’   49. Spend a day outside, working with a shovel, in the searing   heat. ’ ’   50. Make the obituary in The Economist. That doesn’t necessarily   mean a life of wealth, fame, or power. It just means that   you were interesting. ’ ’ John LeFevre is the creator of @GSElevator and the author of   the New York Times bestselling book and Amazon Book of the   Month,  out now on paperback. ’
