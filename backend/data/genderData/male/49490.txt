’  ’ ’   NEW YORK  —   Magnus Carlsen defeated Sergey Karjakin on Wednesday   to retain his World Chess Championship title. ’ ’   Carlsen, from Norway, turned 26 on Wednesday, making the victory   a great birthday present. This is the third time he has claimed   the biggest trophy in chess. ’ ’   His    Russian challenger was a worthy foe. Through 12   classical games, he held tough, scoring a win and briefly putting   Carlsen on the ropes. ’ ’   But Carlsen stormed back and evened the match with a win of his   own. Draws then sent the match to tiebreaks. ’ ’   In those four   games, Carlsen’’s edge became   apparent. Karjakin consistently got into time trouble, not   something that you want to happen in ”rapid” chess. ’ ’   After a draw in the first game and a miraculous escape by   Karjakin, playing black, when Carlsen was on the verge of   checkmate in the second game, Karjakin ran out of time in the   third, and Carlsen had the decisive point he needed. ’ ”   With the black pieces in the fourth, Karjakin tried the fighting   Sicilian Defense for the first time in the match. It’s an opening   he’s played many times, but it’s risky in rapid because although   it gives black good winning chances, it demands quite a bit of   calculation to establish an edge. ” ’  ’ ”   The edge didn’t materialize and Karjakin again ran low on time,   amid several flurries of moves with less than minute on his   clock. With a checkmate in eight moves on the board, according   the computer analysis, and a potentially brilliant queen   sacrifice in the works from Carlsen, Karjakin resigned. ” ’   Carlsen retained his title, and Karjakin proved himself to have   been a   tenacious opponent. ’ ’   The final position: ’ ’  ’ ’     ’
