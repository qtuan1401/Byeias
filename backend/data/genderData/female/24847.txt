The Fox News Channel’s Bill O’Reilly argued President Obama’s “emotional attachment to the Muslim world has hurt the USA” during Wednesday’s “Talking Points” segment.  O’Reilly said, “Many Americans, including this one, believe Barack Obama’s emotional attachment to the Muslim world has hurt the USA. ” He added, “The president does not define the terror issue clearly. Here’s why: Barack Obama’s father, who abandoned his family, was a Muslim who eventually turned atheist. Then his mother married another Muslim, moving young Barry Obama to Indonesia, where he was exposed to the Islamic world even though he did attend a Catholic school in first grade. According to his   Barack Obama attended his  ’s wedding in the early 1990s. Malik Obama was a Muslim.   …     What we can tell you with certainty is that Barack Obama has deep emotional ties to Islam. ” O’Reilly concluded Obama should “aggressively call out those who abuse the Muslim faith, who commit atrocities under a religious banner. He should make defeating the jihad a central issue and stop trying to diminish Islamic terrorism by avoiding the simple truth  —   radical Islam is a direct threat to the entire world. Whether they live in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria or Africa, it is Islamic killers who are the central problem on this planet. President Obama should acknowledge that today and begin to correct his mistakes. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
