Wednesday on the Fox Business Network, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson insisted will take a different approach in Thursday’s debate on the Fox News Channel.  Carson told host Maria Bartiromo he would be more aggressive in the upcoming debate than he had in previous debates. “Well, hopefully they’ll be able to focus on anybody, rather than a specific candidate, that’s going to help quite a bit,” Carson said. “And as far as I’m concerned, you know, as you saw in the last debate, I’m a little more aggressive. I’m going to get even more aggressive this time. I’m not going to hit anybody with anything, but believe me, we’re going to be talking about what we believe in. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
