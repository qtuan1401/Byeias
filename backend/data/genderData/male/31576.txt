A Fontana resident faces charges of animal cruelty after his Chihuahua allegedly digested methamphetamine and went into convulsions. [According to Fox 11, the dog’s owner brought the animal to “the Inland Valley Veterinary Specialists  Emergency Center in Upland for erratic behavior” last week. He told the veterinarian the dog “may have ingested” meth.  Tests for the drug proved positive and the dog was treated and released. But upon arriving home the owner noted the dog convulsing and seizing. “Animal Service Officers” were dispatched and the Chihuahua was taken from the owner on grounds of “general neglect. ” The “San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office, Animal Cruelty Task Force” issued an felony animal cruelty arrest warrant for the dog’s owner, and that warrant was executed Friday. The dog’s owner is now in the West Valley Detention Center. Photo: file, AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
