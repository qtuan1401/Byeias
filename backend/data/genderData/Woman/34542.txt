 (CNN) A Florida teenager turned himself in to police after a video showing him dragging and throwing a woman into a pool was posted online, officials said. The video was captured during a pool party Saturday at a residential community in North Lauderdale, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said. Video footage shows a woman walking into the pool area with her two dogs before some partygoers began surrounding the woman and taking video with their cellphones. A   teenager then picks up Nancy James, but both of them fall to the ground. Within seconds, the young man stands up, drags the woman and throws her into the pool, the video shows. James, 68 and a board member of the Players Place Homeowners Association, suffered injuries to her leg and shoulder, the sheriff’s office said. She showed CNN affiliate WPLG bruises to her left shoulder and right thigh. ”No one should ever, ever, ever have to go through that,” she told the station. ”I didn’t really get to walk in and this kid comes from behind.” She told CNN affiliate WSVN she was trying to intervene on an unauthorized party at the community’s pool when the incident happened. ”We’re just asking them    just lower the volume,” the woman told the station. ”I didn’t care what they were doing. That’s not my job to police the place.” The unnamed teenager turned himself in Monday afternoon. He has been charged with battery of a person 65 years of age or older, officials said. ”I messed up and I have to own up to it,” officials say the teenager told them. Residents at the apartment complex were surprised by the incident.  ”First of all, I can’t even believe that somebody would be allowed to act like that,” resident Tracy Ann Simmonds told CNN affiliate WPBF. ”These young people are a little bit out of control.”
