’  ’ ’     TULSA, Okla. (AP)  —   A white Oklahoma police officer who fatally     shot an unarmed black man last year was found not guilty     Wednesday of   manslaughter.   ’ ’     Jurors deliberated for just over nine hours before finding     Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby not guilty in the Sept. 16     shooting of    Terence Crutcher.   ’ ”     Shelby said she fired her weapon out of fear because she said     he didn’t obey her commands to lie on the ground and appeared     to reach inside his SUV for what she thought was a gun.     Crutcher was unarmed.   ” ”     Prosecutors told jurors that Shelby overreacted. They noted     Crutcher had his hands in their air and wasn’t combative  —   part     of which was confirmed by police video taken from a dashboard     camera and helicopter that showed Crutcher walking away from     Shelby, hands held above his head.   ” ”     Shelby’s attorneys argued that in the two minutes before     cameras began recording the encounter, Shelby repeatedly     ordered Crutcher to stop walking away from her and get on the     ground.   ” ’     Shelby also said she feared Crutcher was under the influence of     PCP, a powerful hallucinogenic known as Angel Dust that makes     users erratic, unpredictable and combative.   ’ ”     An autopsy showed PCP was in Crutcher’s system, and police said     they found a vial of it in his SUV.   ” ’  ’ ’     Crutcher’’s family said police attempted to ”demonize” Crutcher     over the drug possession to deflect attention from the fact     officers didn’’t find a gun inside his SUV.   ’ ’     The killing of    Crutcher was among a spate of       shootings in recent years that helped     galvanize the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted calls     for more police accountability.   ’ ’     Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Shelby     six days after the shooting. An affidavit accused her of     ”becoming emotionally involved to the point that she     overreacted.”   ’ ’     Defense attorney Shannon McMurray argued that prosecutors     rushed to charge Shelby for political reasons, fearing civil     unrest like the angry street protests that erupted in     Charlotte, North Carolina, after the fatal shooting of        Keith Lamont Scott four days after Crutcher was     killed.   ’ ’TULSA, Okla.
