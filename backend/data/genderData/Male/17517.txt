Nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin joined a special edition of Breitbart News Daily this evening to discuss the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia with host Stephen K. Bannon. [“I would count him as a top ten, maybe a top five of all time, and he wasn’t even a Chief Justice,” Levin said of the late Justice Scalia. “This is a devastating loss for people who love this country. It’s a devastating loss for those of us who love the Constitution,” he added.  Scalia, age 79, passed away this evening in Texas. As reported earlier by Breitbart: Justice Antonin Scalia —  one of the most acclaimed legal scholars ever to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States —  has passed away at age 79. Justice Scalia was on a trip hunting quail in Marfa, Texas. He had gone to his room after dinner on Friday, February 12, and made no complaints that he was feeling ill or showing signs of medical distress. When he did not show for breakfast Saturday morning, someone was sent to check his room and discovered the deceased justice. “It’s an absolute disaster. Let me put it this way, Scalia is kind of the Churchill, the Thatcher, and the Reagan of the Supreme Court. He wasn’t even Chief Justice and yet his impact has been massive as an originalist,” Levin went on. “The point is, he moved the Court in ways that the Court would never have moved before, even though we have these disastrous opinions coming from the Court, the brilliance of his decisions   …     he was able to cobble together often four justices, sometimes five justices. He was energetic, he was intellectually bracing. He was by far the leader of that Court, and there are great Justices on that Court,” added Levin.
