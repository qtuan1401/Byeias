’  ’ ’   German police arrested a    Afghan youth on Sunday on   suspicion of a connection to the killing of nine people by an      gunman in Munich, authorities said. ’ ’   The youth was under investigation for possibly having failed to   report the plans of the gunman, who later shot himself, and may   have played a role in a Facebook posting that invited people to   the scene of the shooting, a police statement said. ’ ’   ”There is a suspicion that the    is a possible tacit   accomplice to (Friday’’s) attack,” it said. Police earlier said   the gunman was a deranged   who was fixated with   mass killings but not inspired by Islamist militancy. ’
