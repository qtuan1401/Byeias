’  ’ ”   It’s not easy to reach Brandon Straub these days. The      doesn’t own a cell phone, let alone a landline, and recently, his   days center around finding buyers for the belongings he’s selling   on Craigslist. With $30, 000 in student loans, among other debts,   he’s planning to file for bankruptcy. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   With ITT’s doors locked, that ceremony will never take place. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Before Straub decided to head to ITT, he served in the Air Force   from 2004 to 2013. His time spent working on jets there left him   with several injuries. His neck is full of titanium plates. His   pain is chronic. His back hurts, as do his knees. And   emotionally, he experiences symptoms of   stress   disorder. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   At ITT specifically, recruiters went all over, setting up booths   at local high schools, military bases, and even county fairs. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Consider Owens Community College, Straub’s local public college.   In addition to typical program offerings  —   such as computer   science, nursing, and general arts  —   Owens offers vocational   programs, too  —   like welding, plumbing, pastry making, and John   Deere tech. ’ ’  ’ ’   Still, many of the recruiters, often Sayre’s friends, say they   ”did their best” for students but faced pressure to hit   enrollment targets. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I think that’s one of the biggest misconceptions about the   process,” Wehrum said. ”There were no individual incentives for   representatives.” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Consider, again, Owens Community College in Straub’s town. A     student at Owens pays about $1, 836 a semester or $3, 672   for the year, compared to $24, 220 a year at ITT Tech. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Before Straub enrolled at ITT, he knew of the school’s dicey   reputation. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I would do my work, and then it seemed like some of the guys   that weren’’t doing their work were still passing through the   class,” Straub said. ”If the teachers didn’’t have enough passing   students per quarter then they weren’’t allowed to teach anymore,   and they would get fired.” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Transferring credits from a   college elsewhere isn’t   easy, though. In fact, it’s sometimes impossible. The individual   school makes the decision to accept transfer credits based on the   original institution’s accreditation  —   essentially a review of   courses and programs to ensure a school meets the educational   standards of the accreditor. ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   For all the questions surrounding ITT Tech, its closure came as a   shock. Straub had no warning. Students showed up to locked doors   on September 6. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
