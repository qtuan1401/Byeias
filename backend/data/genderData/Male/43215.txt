’  ’ ’   Good morning! Here are the plays everybody will be talking about   on Tuesday: ’ ’Clemson wins the championship in the final   seconds. Alabama jumped out to an early lead and,   despite struggling on offense for most of the second half, held a   lead for most of the game. But in the final five minutes the two   teams changed leads three times. The final one came with one   second to go when Deshaun Watson hit Hunter Renfrow from the     line. Game over. Clemson 35, Alabama 31. ’ ’ ’ ’Before winning the game, Deshaun Watson went flying like   a helicopter. Watson threw for 420 yards and three   touchdowns. But he also took a couple of big hits during the   game, and none were bigger than this hit as he tried to scramble   for a first down. On first look, it seems as if Watson just got   flipped around a bit like a rag doll. But the replay shows that   he also took a major hit to the chin, a shot that would have   wrecked lesser players. ’ ’ ’ ”Ben Boulware did his homework. Boulware was   named the defensive player of the game for his six tackles, two   tackles for loss, and one pass defensed. But his best play is one   that didn’t show up in the box score. On a   play in the   second quarter, Boulware clearly saw something that he recognized   from watching tape of Alabama. Before Alabama snapped the ball,   Boulware began frantically waving for his teammates to come to   his side, signaling that the play was going that way. You can see   his teammates start to cheat over. Sure enough, Alabama ran the   ball toward Boulware, and Jalen Hurts was stopped for a     loss. ” ’ ’
