Walt Disney World is planning on giving   free insect repellent as soon as Sunday due to the increased threat the Zika virus poses to Florida. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld are following suit. [Disney will hand out various types of mosquito repellent at its theme parks, Disney Springs, and ESPN’s Wide World of Sports, according to the Orlando Sentinel.  The resort will also put aerosol cans in its hotel rooms.  “In an abundance of caution, we are accelerating preventative efforts throughout our property, including providing complimentary insect repellent to our Guests along with helpful guidelines from the Center[s] for Disease Control and Prevention,” Disney said. “We have an extensive   and monitoring program in place, and we continue to work closely with local, state and federal experts on this topic. ” A Universal spokesman said repellent will be available at guest services locations, while SeaWorld will have repellent available at its theme parks, according to the Sentinel. The three   theme parks have stepped up efforts to prevent the Zika virus after the CDC issued warnings for those who are living or traveling to South Florida, where the virus is spreading. Leading Zika expert Professor Jimmy Whitworth warned travelers earlier this year that families should avoid traveling to the southern United States for the next few months, reports the Daily Mail. Zika was first detected in Brazil before it spread to America and can cause pregnant women to give birth to babies with severe birth defects.
