David Salmon uploaded video to his Facebook of the scary fall he took while going down a slide at a private home near Lake Travis in Austin, TX.  The   video shows Salmon going around a turn on the slide and flying off. The caption Salmon wrote for the post says, â€œToo dang old to be going down water slides. Fell off this one that is over a rocky cliff. The location of the slide made it difficult for rescue crews to reach Salmon, who suffered a broken arm, and fractured ribs, as well as lacerations, cuts and bruises on his back, arms and side.
