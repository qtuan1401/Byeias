Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton returned to The Breakfast Club morning show to call for a national dance party to heal the nation. [“I think we need a big national dance,” she said during an appearance on the show, calling for America to “close the fun deficit. ”  “I’m sick of all this meanness,” she continued. “Why don’t these people who support my opponent go out and have fun dancing? You think they dance. ” Clinton recalled fondly the White House dance parties when Bill Clinton was president. “I love to dance,” she said. “And when we were at the White House and in years since, we’ve had a lot of dance parties just because I love the way people kind of lose themselves, right?”
