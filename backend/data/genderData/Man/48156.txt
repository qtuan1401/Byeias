’    ’ ’ ’ ’ LeBron James is a busy man. The    NBA star   began his professional career at 18 playing for the Cleveland   Cavaliers. He has since gone on to win three championships,   including one for the Cavaliers this year in arguably the   most impressive comeback in NBA history. ’ ’ The Cavaliers were down   in the NBA Finals against the   Golden State Warriors, who went   in the regular season. No   NBA team had ever come back from that deficit to win the   Finals. ’ ’  ’ ’ Now that the season is over, James has been pursuing a lot   outside basketball. In his hometown of Akron, Ohio, he created   the LeBron James Family Foundation and has pledged to give   students there   college scholarships. In addition to the   work in his community, James is laying the groundwork to become a   billionaire businessman. He is the first athlete to receive a   lifetime contract with Nike and he recently signed a     NBA contract for about $100 million. James also cofounded a     company for athletes called Uninterrupted and   made his film debut in 2015’’s ”Trainwreck.” He is rumored to be   exploring a role in a sequel to ”Space Jam.” ’ ’ I sat down with James at the Crosby Street Hotel in New York   City on Thursday morning for a   interview about his life   on and off the court. ’ ’ The highlights: ’ ” Here’s the interview, which has been lightly edited for   length and clarity: ” ”Alyson Shontell, Business Insider US     : Tell me what you’ve been up to in the   offseason? I saw some ? ” ”LeBron James: I’ve been doing a little vacation,   a lot of family time. During the season you’re wrapped into the   whole basketball thing and how to prepare to win every night and   things of that nature. The family takes a hit because you don’t   get to spend as much time with them as you would like. ” ”   So, in the offseason I spend a lot of time with the family. I’ve   also been doing a lot of things with my business, so it’s been   going well. ” ’Shontell: I want to talk to you about all of   your business ventures. But first, we have to talk about this   amazing comeback you just had. No team has come back from a     deficit in the finals, and yet you did. ’ ’   So, take me back to that night, game four. What happened between   games four and five? A lot of people would have thought, ”All   right  —   that’’s it.” ’ ’James: Right. It was a difficult night. The   series was   and we had another opportunity to tie the series   at home. And we played a great first half in that game four. We   were up at the half, and then in the third quarter it just went   down the drain. ’ ’   We lost our defensive pressure. Golden State turned up the   pressure, and they were able to steal our   advantage to   go up  . ’ ’  ’ ’   So I’’m sitting at home, recalibrating and thinking about the   game. And everyone is kind of down at that point. For me as a   leader, I couldn’’t allow myself to get in a funk. I just started   to try and recalibrate and say, ”Listen, we’’ve got to go to   Golden State for game five. We’’ve got to come home anyways. So   why not come home and give our fans another game, and give them   an opportunity to have a game six?” ’ ”   And that was my mindset. I was very relaxed going out to Golden   State for game five, and obviously we saw what happened in that   game. I was extremely confident in my teammates’ abilities   throughout game five, and then coming home in game six to our   fans, who are ecstatic and crazy as can be. ” ”   And then, in game seven, it’s one game. It’s sudden death, and it   doesn’t matter what’s going on at that point. I believe in one   game, I’m going to take myself every time. ” ”   If you just give me one game for it all, I’m going to take it   myself. And we were able to do something that’s never been done,   like you mentioned, a comeback from  . And to win it on their   home floor  —   it was an amazing feat for our franchise. ” ’Shontell: You told a great story on  about how   you spent that night of game four. You sent a group text to your   troops, and you said  —   what did you say? ’ ’James: We have a group chat throughout the   season where we talk about everything, with all the guys. We talk   about everything from ”Hey, this is what time we’’re doing dinner”   to ”This is what time the bus is” or just mentally preparing for   games. ’ ’   I was sitting at home with my wife, and we we’’re watching Eddie   Murphy’’s   comedy [”Raw”] because I wanted to get my mind   off the game and bring some more joy into the room. And then I   sent a group chat text to my guys, saying, ”OK, listen: It   doesn’’t matter what just happened. And I know we’’re all down   about it, but in order for us to accomplish what no one believes   we can do, we have to refocus and we have to   in. You guys   do your part, and I promise you, as the leader of the team, I   won’’t let you down. Just follow my lead.” ’ ’Shontell: So game seven, the play everybody   talks about is your chasedown block. ESPN clocked you going 19   miles an hour to get from half court to where you could slam that   ball against the backboard in just a few seconds. Where does that   play rank for you? Is that your No. 1 LeBron play of all time? ’ ” WATCH: LeBron’s chasedown block ” ’James: I would have to say, just coming off the   top of my mind, that would definitely rank No. 1  —   just because   of the magnitude of the game and what was going on at that point   in the game. ’ ’   I had to run through a couple guys and get around a couple guys   to get to that position. And it was a big moment, not only for   that particular moment in the game, but for Cleveland sports   history now that you can look back upon it. A lot of people are   saying so. ’ ”   A lot of people will base a   jump shot, or dunk, or   something that happened offensively. But for my legacy to be a   block or something defensively to help us win, that’s the   ultimate for me. ” ”Shontell: You guys won. You didn’t cry the two   times you won your championships in Miami, but you did for this,   so clearly it was emotional. What was the plane ride like? ” ’James: It was pandemonium. There was definitely   no crying. There was so much laughter and joking and excitement.   Our franchise took us to Vegas from San Francisco. Guys partied   there, and then we went home and had another celebration. ’ ’   So we had a   flight back to Cleveland in front of our   fans, and they were there waiting at the airport. No one slept.   We were so high off adrenaline and emotions and everything. I   wish I could get it back. I wish I had a GoPro attached to my   head throughout everything where I could have captured it all.   But the memories are still here for sure. ’ ”Shontell: You were wearing an Ultimate Warrior   shirt when you got off the plane. People loved that  —   well, or   hated it. Be honest: Did you pack that before you won game seven?   How’d you wind up wearing that shirt? ” ’ WATCH: The story behind the Ultimate Warrior             ’ ’James: Well, it’’s funny because my wife bought   [it earlier]. She asked me who my favorite wrestlers of all time   were, and I told her Sting, ”Stone Cold” Steve Austin, Ultimate   Warrior, The Undertaker, and Ric Flair. Those are some of my   favorite guys ever from growing up. ’ ’   So, one day I get home from practice, and there are these     laying in my bedroom, and my wife purchased them from a   store. I packed them all throughout the playoffs. And the shirt   that I had on to come home in, I wore in Vegas, and my teammates   sprayed me with Champagne. It got soaking wet, so I had to throw   it in the trash, and the only other shirt I had in my bag was my   Ultimate Warrior  . ’ ’Shontell: The only one? ’ ”James: That was the only one because all our   bags were underneath the plane. So the only one I had was the   Ultimate Warrior   that was packed in my travel luggage.   And that’s what I put on. Everybody thinks it was set up that   way, but it really wasn’t. It kind of worked out that way. ” ’Shontell: But what if you had lost? That shirt   would not have been on if you had lost. ’ ”James: That would have been the   I’d have   had on still. Or I could have done the J. R. Smith and not worn a    . ” ”Shontell: That might not have gone over well in   Cleveland if things hadn’t worked out. Let’s talk about your   business initiatives, because you’re doing a lot there. You have   a great other half in Maverick Carter, who’s been a friend for   decades. Tell me the story about how you two met and how you   trusted him with your brand. ” ’  ’ ’James: We grew up in the same hometown of Akron,   Ohio, which is a very small city. And if you know one person,   then that person knows one of your family members, and everyone   becomes family, basically. ’ ”   As we became teenagers, Maverick ended up going to St.    . Mary [High School]. When I was in   we   struck up a great friendship from being childhood friends as   well. He kind of recruited me to come to his school, and I   eventually went to St.  . Mary. When I was a freshman,   he was a senior. He was our senior captain of the ball club, and   I looked up to him and saw the way he approached the game and   school and things of that nature. He’s always been someone I was   fond of. ” ”   Our friendship continued to where he graduated high school and   went off to college, and then I played my   years. When   I went off to be a pro, I knew he was someone I wanted to keep   around me. And now we’re not only friends  —   we’re also business   partners. ” ’   To add on to what you were saying, Alyson, we have done some   great things so far. We have a TV show on Starz called   ”Survivor’’s Remorse.” We have a show on CNBC coming out [on   August 24] called ”Cleveland Hustles.” We have ”Uninterrupted,”   where athletes can dig in deep on what they’’re going through  —     giving fans even more insight into what they’’re doing as well.   We’’re doing so many great things that it all kind of runs in   together, but it’’s our passion. It’’s our passion from when we   were kids to now, and it’’s great to be able to put those things   into real life. ’ ’Shontell: Tell me a little bit more about   ”Uninterrupted.” Sports people know what it is, but it just   launched last year. You guys raised a little bit of money for it,   and it’’s distributed media, right? ’ ’James: Right. So, we’’re not journalism, and we   don’’t want to get in the way of that. But our platform gives fans   an even more   look into what we do on a    basis.   It could be about anything. It could be, ”Hey, I just woke up. I   just want to let you guys know that I’’m off to my workout.” Or it   could be, ”I’’m taking my kids to school.” ’ ’   It gives our fans the [feeling] they’’re actually with you. It   gives them even more   conversation, because sometimes,   when you’’re in the locker room and you do an interview, once it   comes on television, it’’s just a small sample of what you were   saying. With ”Uninterrupted,” it gives our fans even more insight   and there are no breaks. It’’s completely naturally. There’’s no   cut or edit. It’’s just raw, and our fans have gravitated towards   it, and I’’m happy to [be] a part of it and to be a founder as   well. ’ ’Shontell: One part you just mentioned was your   CNBC show that’’s launching, ”Cleveland Hustles.” It seems like a   lot of the things you do are to help where you’’re from.   Obviously, you’’ve got your foundation there that gives back a   lot, but tell me a little bit about ”Cleveland Hustles.” ’ ’James: Like you just mentioned, I have an   opportunity to give back to my community. There’’s my foundation   and what we do for the kids, but also I have an opportunity to   produce a show, ”Cleveland Hustles,” that debuts on the 24th of   August on CNBC. It gives the common person with a dream an   opportunity to make that dream come to life. ’ ”   We have entrepreneurs who have startup companies, and we have   some great investors who are putting their time and their money   behind them. We’ve given the normal person with a dream the   opportunity to make that dream become a successful reality. ” ’   For me to be part of that, and for me to create jobs and insight   into what goes on in Cleveland as well . .. Hopefully, if that   becomes successful, we can go to other cities. We can have   ”Detroit Hustles.” We can have ”Chicago Hustles.” We can have   ”Louisville Hustles.” Because every city in America has that   hustle mentality, and sometimes they just need someone to   recognize that. So hopefully, we can jump off of that once we   have this Cleveland one going. ’ ’Shontell: Your foundation has a lot of different   components, but you focus on   and also their   parents, and   kids as well. So there are a lot of   different moving parts, but why  ? ’ ’James: Statistics show that if kids fall behind   in the   then the chances of them graduating are a lot   less than any other grade. That let us know, ”OK, this is the   grade that we need to start with. We need to get these kids in   the  .” And we’’ve been fortunate enough to be in our   sixth year now. Our   who started the first year of   the program are now in  . And now we have a new group   of kids coming in, and it’’s been warming for me to see kids   really accept this. ’ ”Shontell: One thing that just   went viral is the news that you’re now suddenly going to help   these kids get   scholarships to college when they become   of age. ” ”James: I worked very closely with the University   of Akron, and I wanted to do something even more special. We   started off mentoring these kids, the   all the way   up through high school and get them to a point where they can   eventually graduate high school. But I didn’t think that was   enough. I wanted to take it a step further than that. ” ”   So, we partnered with the University of Akron and started another   program where, if the kids sustain a 3. 0   average  —     something we feel like our kids can meet under the circumstances   and supervision we’ve given them  —   then at the end of that road   there’s a college scholarship. And then they can take that from   there. So that’s what we’re hoping our kids can do. We know our   kids can do that, and we’re going to keep the infrastructure   around them to make sure that they can accomplish that. ” ’Shontell: That’’s not a cheap thing you’’re   offering here. It’’s about $41 million worth of commitments.   Which, by the way, is in total contrast to the role you   played in the movie ”Trainwreck.” Why were you so cheap in that   movie? You played yourself, but that doesn’’t seem true to   character. ’ ’James: You know, I was actually going to pay for   this interview, but I left my wallet downstairs in the car . .. ’ ”Shontell: I’ll get an IOU. But it was hilarious    —   in the movie you were making people split every bill. Do you do   that in real life? ” ”James: Yeah, sometimes! Sometimes. It was fun to   be a part of that cast, with the great Amy Schumer, the great   Bill Hader and Judd Apatow. Unbelievable. Vanessa Bryant, who’s   also a Cleveland girl, too. We had a lot of fun on set, but some   of those instances in that movie, is actually some actuality   about me. ” ’ WATCH: LeBron on the possibility of ”Space Jam           2” ’ ’Shontell: While we’’re on the subject of movies,   ”Space Jam 2”? ’ ’James: Would love to, would love to. And there   have been a lot of talks about it, but, obviously, I have a great   partnership with Warner Bros. and they definitely were the ones   who brought ”Space Jam 1,” which was incredible. Michael Jordan   and the Looney Tunes  —   they did an unbelievable thing not only   for my childhood, but for so many kids and so many people that   followed the franchise. ’ ’   So, obviously, we want to make sure that it’’s right. We don’’t   want to rush it. We don’’t want to do something that’’s not   authentic to the ”Space Jam” brand. So, hopefully, we can get it   right. But right now, where it stands, the ”Space Jam” franchise   is in a great place. ’ ”Shontell: On a more serious note, you and your   friends did an amazing thing at the ESPYs, talking a lot about   some very serious issues that many people, quite frankly, with   huge endorsements on the line, just don’t feel comfortable   talking about. Why weren’t you kind of afraid to speak out about   that? ” ’James: It’’s just in me. It’’s who I am, and it’’s   something I’’m passionate about. And it feels right. If it feels   right to me, then I believe it should be spoke upon, and I have   so many different avenues where I can do that  —   through   ”Uninterrupted,” through my social platform, and also the ESPYs   were a perfect platform, because they’’re the one day of the year   where all our fellow athletes get together in the same venue. ’ ”   And to have a brotherhood like I have with Chris Paul, and Dwyane   Wade, and Carmelo Anthony  —   we use that platform to voice our   opinions about the state of America and the state of how we see   it today. My particular point was about, it’s OK to lend money,   and it’s fine to make an appearance, but I think it’s more   impactful to actually get into our communities and get these kids    —   kid by kid, brick by brick, and street by street, family by   family  —   and actually use our infrastructure we’ve built over our   careers to actually make an impact. Because these kids look up to   us as role models and superheroes and father figures and things   of that nature. So, that was my message. ” ’  ’ ”Shontell: We only have a few minutes left, and I   wanted to ask you: I’m sure you’ve heard that Kevin Durant is   joining the Golden State Warriors. How did you learn about that   news, and what did you think? ” ’James: I learned just like everyone else,   through social media. I think it was on the Fourth of July when   it actually happened, and I was in my home in Los Angeles,   preparing for a Fourth of July barbecue. When I saw the news I   was like, ”Wow.” ’ ’   I think everyone had the ”wow” thing. My [reaction] was no   different from the average person who doesn’’t know basketball to   the person who watches it or covers it every day. So, I think   it’’s all great for our league. Our league is very competitive.   It’’s continued to grow, and [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver has   done a great job of picking up where David Stern started, so it’’s   pretty cool. ’ ’Shontell: A lot of people didn’’t react as calmly   as you might have to that news. Fans had opinions about it and   thought, ”It’’s not right. He’’s joining a   team.” Do   you better understand now the reaction fans had towards you when   you joined the Heat? ’ ”James: Well, I think every decision is   different. My decision to leave Cleveland to go to Miami and then   go back is different from Kevin Durant leaving OKC [home of the   Oklahoma City Thunder] and going to the Warriors. It’s different   from Shaq leaving Orlando and going to the [Los Angeles] Lakers.   It’s different from Michael retiring, coming back, retiring,   coming back, and then going to the [Washington] Wizards. So I   think every decision is different, and how much you have invested   in that player, I guess, or how much you feel for that player is   how you’re going to react. So everyone is different. ” ’Shontell: Did any other teams have a chance of   getting you back then, or was it just Cleveland or Miami? ’ ”James: No, there were a few teams. I’ve   mentioned it before that I looked strongly at Chicago at the   time. And I gave some thought to the [New York] Knicks and the   [Brooklyn] Nets at the time as well. I met with those two teams.   I also met with the [Los Angeles] Clippers back then, but it   ultimately came down to me staying home or going to Miami once I   knew that I needed to partner with some great players to get past   Boston. ” ’   Boston was the team with Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen, and Paul   Pierce, and Rajon Rondo. I knew that I had to get better with   talent. And Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh fit that mold. ’ ”Shontell: Switching gears a little bit, I don’t   know if you’ve read this or not, but Michael Phelps was   apparently eating something like 12, 000 calories before the   Beijing Olympics. The guy, I’m not kidding, he would eat a fully   stacked egg sandwich, omelets . .. ” ’James: Yeah, I heard about that. Pancakes, and   pizzas . .. ’ ’Shontell: . .. to the point where I would   not want to eat anymore. Do you do that? ’ ”James: No. I do not do that. Before competition   for me would be like a chicken breast and maybe a little pasta.   The carbs help because you’re going out and playing a lot of   minutes. But a salad and some veggies will have me perfectly   fine. And before the game I might have a protein shake and some   fruit, and I’ll be ready to go. ” ”   But as far as pies or pizza and sandwiches and french fries  —   I   can’t. I’ll wait for that after the game. I can’t do that before   the game. ” ”Shontell: And how about your workout schedule? I   know you said you’re waking up at 5 a. m. still, even though   you’re supposed to be resting. ” ”James: Right. I know  —   I can’t rest. I try, but   my workout regimen is pretty much five times a week, every day.   And it varies. Sometimes I stay at home and work out. Sometimes   I’ll go to an actual class. I’ve been to, like, VersaClimber   classes, or spinning classes. I do pilates as well. So, it kind   of varies depending on how I’m feeling. ” ’Shontell: And is that the same throughout the   season? I would assume you do    workouts sometimes. ’ ”James: During the season, we’re playing   basketball every single day, and we’re working on our bodies   every day. So I don’t get the opportunity to do the classes as   much because we’re doing a lot of traveling. But my workout   regimen is pretty consistent then as well. It’s mostly seven days   a week during the season because we play games on the weekend. ” ”Shontell: Finally, a leadership question: You’re   a great leader both on and off the court, for the people of   Akron, for all of Cleveland, and for your team, picking them up   from that   deficit. How do you do it? How can someone be a   leader like you? ” ”James: I think you have to accept it. Some   people were born with it, but some people learn it as well. For   me, as the leader of our franchise and the leader of my household   and the leader of so many different things, I think it’s about   confidence but also practicing what you preach. ”
