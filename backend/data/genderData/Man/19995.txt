Brock Lesnar says Ronda Rousey needs to learn how to lose before becoming a winner. [The remarks from the former UFC heavyweight champion came on ESPN’s SportsCenter in response to Rousey’s admission on Tuesday’s Ellen DeGeneres Show that she considered suicide after losing to Holly Holm at UFC 193.  “I’m a big fan of Ronda’s and have been since the beginning,” Lesnar noted Tuesday night. “One thing that I learned and she should have learned a long time ago was that you have to learn how to lose before you can actually win. ” Lensar says he knows this because he used to behave as a “bad loser. ” The   Rousey strangely resembles the   Lesnar perhaps more than any other fighter. Appearing indestructible, talking trash outside of the cage, and transcending the sport, the charismatic   proved the axiom that the bigger they are the harder they fall. Perhaps Lesnar’s behavior offers a blueprint for Rousey. He dubbed himself a “humble” champion after his comeback win over Shane Carwin more than a year after he taunted defeated opponent Frank Mir, told the world he intended to get on top of his wife, and insulted UFC sponsor Bud Light by announcing he planned to drink a Coors Light after his victory at UFC 100. Rousey refused to shake hands with Miesha Tate after her second victory over her, laughed at a knocked out Bethe Correia, and provoked at skirmish with the   Holly Holm after their  . “I think she’s got a lot on her plate,” Lesnar offered in a second piece of advice. “You can’t be a fighter and be in 10 movies a year. She’s going to have to step back and find out what Ronda wants to do moving forward. ” Rousey appears on one of the covers of Sports Illustrated‘s swimsuit edition on stands now, hosted Saturday Night Live last month, and stars in the forthcoming Road House remake. She seeks to avenge her loss in a rematch with Holm later this year.
