Many law enforcement careers are on the line in California as an    out of Oakland is saying she has slept with “more than 30” California police officers, says a report by ABC 7 Chicago.  The woman, who goes by the name Celeste Guap, is a prostitute who says she has slept with street cops, sergeants, captains and a police dog handler some when she was underage. The daughter of an Oakland police dispatcher says she was 16 when she had sex with her first officer, an Oakland cop and friend of her mother. “And he would tell me, he be like, ‘Hurry up and turn, hurry up and turn 18,’” she told an ABC 7 reporter. “But I talked him into it. I feel guilty because he was trying to do the right thing. ” According to Celeste, only three of the officers paid her for her services, but they often shared information on undercover operations or police reports. The current tally kept by ABC 7 shows how the scandal spread from the Oakland PD to other nearby law enforcement: At least seven law enforcement agencies have reportedly launched investigations. The Alameda County Sheriff cleared four deputies who had sex with Celeste, but determined it was consensual, without exchanging money, and she was 18 at the time.
