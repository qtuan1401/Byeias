Former and potentially future first daughter Chelsea Clinton is defending her decision to stay on the board of the Clinton Foundation, even if her mother is elected president. [“I’m committed to helping steward that transition because it is complicated,” she said, during an appearance on ABC’s The View.  Chelsea Clinton insisted it was important to keep her father’s work at the foundation intact, citing the millions of people who were receiving aid from her family’s legacy project. “We also employ about 2, 000 people, we have a responsibility to the millions of people who are benefiting from our work, we also have the responsibility to our employees to make sure that they have jobs in the future,” Clinton said. When Clinton was asked if she would continue to raise funds for the foundation she refused to answer, saying that “we’ll see” after the election. “For now, I’ll certainly stay on the board,” she said.
