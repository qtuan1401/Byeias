An Alabama teen was brutally beaten after he posted   comments on Facebook in the aftermath of recent police shootings. [Brian Ogle, 17, is in critical condition with a fractured skull and trauma to his brain, WBMA reported.  His mother, Brandi Allen, says her son was targeted for his views, and she is calling the beating a “hate crime. ” “Not knowing if my son is going to make it to his 18th birthday this month, I don’t know if anybody can understand what that feels like,” Allen said to WBMA. Allen said he was targeted because of his   comments on Facebook after students wore Black Lives Matter shirts to Sylacauga High School last week. Police say he was beaten up by multiple people in an abandoned parking lot Friday. Police attribute the beating to possible racial tensions that are growing at the school, but did not find any evidence that Black Lives Matter contributed to this shooting. “I want to see them in jail, this most certainly is a race issue, it’s a hate crime. ” Allen said. Allen is seeking justice for her son no matter who did this. “I want them punished to the fullest extent, to the fullest, my son could have lost his life. I won’t stop until they are punished,” Allen said. Police have not yet made any arrests in this case.
