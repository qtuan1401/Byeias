A    man died at an apartment party on early Saturday morning in Brooklyn after falling through a screen window on the buildingâ€™s fourth floor, the police said. It was the second falling death of the night in Brooklyn. Earlier, a    boy died and another boy was injured after falling from the rooftop of a building nearby in Bushwick. The police said the two boys may have been trying to jump from one building to another. The    man, Wyatt Tyler, had fallen after leaning against the screen window in an apartment on Metropolitan Avenue between Olive and Catherine Streets in the East Williamsburg neighborhood, officials said. He lived nearby on the same street. The police said they received a 911 call around 2:30 a. m. and arrived to find Mr. Tyler unconscious and unresponsive on the street. Emergency medical technicians took him to Woodhull Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. The falling death involving the teenager happened around 5:30 p. m. on Friday at 57 Grove Street, a multistory building about two miles away near Bushwick Avenue, the police said. The boys were found in the back of the building. The police previously reported the episode happened around 4:30 p. m. The police said one of the teenagers was unconscious and had severe trauma to his head and body. The other was semiconscious and had injuries to his pelvis. The first boy was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital Center, and the other was conscious and alert, the police said. Their names were not immediately made available. In January last year, a    girl died after she tried to jump from one rooftop to another in Midtown Manhattan and fell five stories, the police said.
