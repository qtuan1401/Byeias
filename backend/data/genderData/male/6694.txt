Two court bailiffs were shot and killed by a prisoner who managed to grab a law enforcement officer’s gun inside a Michigan courthouse on Monday afternoon, and the prisoner himself was then killed, a county sheriff said. The shooting followed a struggle as officials were trying to transfer the prisoner from a holding cell to a courtroom where he was to appear before a judge, said Paul Bailey, the Berrien County sheriff. The prisoner broke free, shot and wounded a sheriff’s deputy, then fatally shot the two bailiffs before shooting another person who was standing in a courthouse hallway, Sheriff Bailey said. The prisoner was then shot and killed, apparently by officials who rushed to the hallway. “It’s a sad day,” Sheriff Bailey said, noting that he had known the bailiffs for decades they had worked in other law enforcement roles before taking the courthouse jobs. Officials said they were uncertain how the inmate had grabbed a gun  —   and did not yet know whose weapon he grabbed  —   but said that routine procedures had been followed for bringing jail inmates to court appearances in Berrien County, in the southwest part of the state. Sheriff Bailey later identified the prisoner as Larry Darnell Gordon, 45, and the bailiffs who were killed as Joseph Zangaro, 61, and Ronald Kienzle, 63, The Associated Press said. Standing behind Sheriff Bailey during an evening news conference, Gov. Rick Snyder called the shooting an “awful act,” and urged residents to stand together in Michigan and elsewhere. “I ask that all Michiganders put your prayers out, your thoughts and prayers,” Mr. Snyder said. “This is a particularly tough time for law enforcement. ” The courthouse is in St. Joseph, a community of about 8, 200 people on Lake Michigan and the seat of Berrien County.
