New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is cautioning Republicans against lecturing their supporters for being angry, even though he defended South Carolina Nikki Haley for speaking her mind during her Republican response to the State of the Union address. [“We will not win the presidency by telling people they’re wrong for being angry that middle class wages have declined under this president,” he said in an interview with Laura Ingraham. “We’re not going to win the presidency by telling the people that they’re wrong when the foreign policy of this country has made America weaker and a joke. ”  He defended Haley’s speech, however, praising her for putting “a very good face on the Republican party” after Obama’s State of the Union speech. “I praise her courage for saying what she believes,” he said. Christie said he had been asked to do the response to the State of the Union address in the past, but chose not to. “The fact is, you get into that, and you’re going to wind up angering lots of different people,” he said.
