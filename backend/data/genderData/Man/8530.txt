Taking a stand against Netflix and other video streaming services, the Cannes Film Festival will ban any films that are solely digitally distributed from entering the festival starting next year. [Slate reports that in response to questions as to whether or not the films Okja, directed by Bong Joon Ho, and The Meyerowitz Stories, directed by Noah Baumbach, would be appearing in the festival, organizers released a full statement which says that all films in the future entering the Cannes Film Festival must have been released in French movie theatres.  The Cannes Film Festival and Netflix have had a rocky relationship for some time now, leaving many surprised when Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories  —   both distributed by Netflix  —   were included in the festival lineup. Many Netflix films had previously been refused entry, and festival officials previously advocated for the “discouraging” of Netflix’s online distribution platform. The two Netflix films in question will be receiving a theatrical release in the US, but festival officials stated that “no agreement has been reached” to release the films in French cinemas and that the effort to reach one was made “in vain. ” Festival Officials did clarify that their new   rules will go into effect next year, allowing Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories to enter the competition this year: Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
