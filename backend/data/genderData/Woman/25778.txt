Thursday at the White House press briefing, press secretary Josh Earnest compared Congress overriding President Barack Obama’s veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) to children in elementary school.  Earnest aid, “It’s hard to take at face value the suggestion that they were unaware of the consequences of their vote, but even if they were, what’s true in elementary school is true in the United States Congress, ignorance is not an excuse. Particularly when it comes to our national security and the safety and security of our diplomats and our service members. ” He added, “I’ll also say it’s a little hard to take that suggestion seriously when the arguments that are being made in this letter and in the public statements from some members of Congress are precisely the same arguments that senior administration officials have been making for months. ” (  Politico) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
