San Diego (CNN) Viewers of ”The Walking Dead” were left with one of the cruelest TV cliffhangers in recent history last season, but executive producer Robert Kirkman promises the resolution season 7 will be ”absolutely worth the wait.” The fates of 11 key characters in AMC’s zombie hit hangs in the balance. So as to not reveal any hints, each actor    plus Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who plays villainous Negan    showed up for the show’s panel at   in San Diego on Friday. Their tease for the upcoming season? ”It’s a really     start to the season,” Andrew Lincoln said, referring to the fact the cast will be losing a member. But, he added, it’s all leading to ”one of the greatest showdowns we’ve had on this show since Terminus.” AMC also premiered the new trailer.  Understandably, not much footage from the fatal first scene was shown    but lots of other teases were revealed, including an extended look at Ezekiel (Khary Payton) and his pet tiger Shiva.   ”The world is expanding and getting more complex,” executive producer Gale Anne Hurd said.  Season 7 of ”The Walking Dead” premieres October 23.
