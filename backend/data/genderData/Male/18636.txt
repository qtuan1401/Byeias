PARIS (Reuters)  —   France has staged a mock chemical weapons attack on a football “fan zone” as it prepares for the Euro 2016 football championships in June, less than a year after Islamist militants killed 130 people in attacks in and around the French capital. [More than a thousand police and firemen took part in the attack response drill in the southern city of Nîmes, the largest ever carried out in France.  The exercise was designed to simulate a chemical attack in a “fan zone” a closed perimeter area where football fans will be able to monitor the competition on giant outdoor screens when not attending matches in one of the 10 stadiums. A Reuters witness saw dozens of police and military officers taking part in the drill, some of them equipped with gas masks. French   police arrested a group with Islamist militant ties on Wednesday, suspecting one of them may have been planning another attack in the capital. “In Nîmes, it was about a chemical or bacteriological threat,” Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was quoted as saying in daily newspaper 20 minutes. “We don’t believe there is a genuine risk of this type of attack but we must envisage every hypothesis. ” It will be the third time that France hosted the UEFA European Championship after having been chosen for the 1960 inaugural tournament and the finals in 1984.
