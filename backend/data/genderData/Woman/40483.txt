 (CNN) Even the grungiest rock stars have owned credit cards.  Now, fans of Nirvana have the chance to have the   Visa that belonged to deceased front man Kurt Cobain. The Seafirst BankCard Visa has Cobain’s signature on the back in blue. There’s also what appears to be a phone number scribbled next his signature. The expiration date reads February 1995. Nearly a year before, on April 5, 1994, the musician shot himself in the head at his Seattle home. Paddle8, a marketplace for collectors of art and memorabilia, estimates that the card is worth around $7, 000 to $9, 000, according to its website. With five days left before the auction ends, the card is currently drawing bids of more than $12, 000. The online platform, which claims the credit card is in excellent condition, is offering the item as part of its ”Legendary: Memorabilia From Rock Gods and Pop Stars” collection. The credit card is one of the top valued items on the auction house’s site, which is offering pop   memorabilia, including Frank Sinatra’s driver’s license from 1944, and a handwritten U2 setlist from their tour supporting the band’s 1983 album ”War.”
