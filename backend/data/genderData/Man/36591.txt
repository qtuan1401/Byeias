Philadelphia (CNN) Wikileaks released a series of voicemails Wednesday from the Democratic National Committee hack showing donors plying   officials for favors, and one donor expressing outrage that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had won a say in the drafting of the party’s platform.  In one of the 29 voicemails released, a woman who donated $300 to Clinton called the party finance director Andrew Wright and said she was angry the party was acquiescing to Sanders by allowing liberal activist and prominent Sanders surrogate Cornel West to have one of 15 seats on the party’s   panel. ”I’m furious about what you are doing for Bernie Sanders, he’s getting way too much influence. I’m on a fixed income, I spent over $300, donated to Hillary, what I see is the DNC bending over backwards for Bernie and Bernie is the worst person in the world to even be running in the Democratic Party, because he’s not a Democrat,” said the unidentified woman in a voicemail that was sent to Wright’s DNC email account. In another voicemail, Bill Eacho, a longtime Democratic donor and former U. S. ambassador, inquired about the details of a ”small dinner with President Obama.”  The voicemails are related to the batch of about 20, 000 leaked emails WikiLeaks published earlier this week, which revealed that elements within the supposedly neutral DNC were in fact working to help Hillary Clinton secure the Democratic nomination. Those emails ultimately led DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz announcing her resignation.  But most of the released voicemails amount to innocuous messages from one person trying to reach someone else. A few of the messages highlight the relationships between donors looking for favors and goodies, and the party officials trying to bring in money to their coffers.
