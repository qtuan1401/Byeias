Vice President Joe Biden argued that “Building walls is fundamentally contrary to what made this country what it is” and “the United States erecting a wall  …    makes a lie of everything we say about ourselves” in an interview broadcast on Thursday’s “Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC.  Biden said, “Building walls is fundamentally contrary to what made this country what it is. We’re a pluralistic society, and it functions. Look around the world. Every other country where there’s absolute chaos now, what is it? They’re pluralistic without consensus. Look at almost every single country, from Syria, to Iraq, to Iran, to Ukraine. No matter where it is. And I just think it is totally counter to our tradition. Should we have border security? Yes. But the idea of the United States erecting a wall, for the world to see, makes a lie of everything we say about ourselves. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
