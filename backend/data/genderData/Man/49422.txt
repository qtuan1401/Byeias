’  ’ ”   In your 30s, you’ve (hopefully) started to check off important   financial milestones: You’re  you have an  and you’re . ” ”   And if you haven’t already, you also want to start investing. But   how much should you contribute? ” ’   The short answer: Anything you can, according to Sallie   Krawcheck, a former Wall Street executive who founded and now   serves as the CEO of . ’ ”   But if you’re waiting until your 30s to start investing, you’re   too late. ” ’   ”Just do it, just do it, just do it!” Krawcheck told Business   Insider. ”Because it’’s costing you a fortune, especially women,”   she added, noting that women were less likely to invest. ”It   costs women tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, sometimes   millions of dollars over the course of their lives.” ’ ’’ ’   Contrary to the idea that you should wait until you have a   substantial amount to invest, Krawcheck recommends that everyone   start in his or her 20s, even if someone has only $50 or $100 to   put in, because it will start compounding right away. ’ ’   ”Over time,” Krawcheck said, you will ”have a return on that   money you put in, and then you’’ll earn a return on that return,   and then you’’ll earn a return on that return on that return.” ’ ”   She’s referring to  which is when the interest earned on an   investment earns interest on itself. Because of it, a little   money contributed today will ultimately  than a lot of money contributed tomorrow  —   so don’t   wait, even if you’re putting in only 1% of your paycheck at   first. ”
