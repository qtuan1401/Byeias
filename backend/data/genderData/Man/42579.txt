 (CNN) Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was behind bars at a federal prison in Colorado on Thursday, a day after a judge formally sentenced him to death. Tsarnaev, 21, arrived Thursday at the United States Penitentiary in Florence, Colorado, U. S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman Edmond Ross said. On Wednesday, Assistant U. S. Attorney William Weinreb said Tsarnaev would eventually be transferred to a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. Tsarnaev has been held under the tight restrictions usually reserved for terrorists they include solitary confinement and no contact with other inmates or the outside world.  Most prisoners subject to those restrictions serve their time at the   Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, which houses some of the most notorious criminals in recent U. S. history. But the federal government’s death row is at the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and the judge ordered him executed under the prevailing laws of Indiana.  The Colorado prison where Tsarnaev was transferred Thursday is in the same facility as the Supermax prison, but it’s a different prison. 13th Juror: Words of wisdom for all the angry young men
