Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy shared his reaction to FBI Director James Comey’s statement about Hillary Clinton with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon. [Gaffney stated:  Comey has indicted [Hillary Clinton] in everything but name. He laid out the convicting evidence that she is guilty. The bad news is that he didn’t actually say that he’s going to recommend her indictment, and the worst of it, as far as I’m concerned, is he actually said other people would be prosecuted for this, other people who engage in this kind of conduct would face this kind of criminal penalty. She won’t. Continued Gaffney, “What that says to me is that he has rewritten the law. He has established a precedent that will do incredible damage to the very important function of protecting classified information. ” It is, therefore, he said, “reasonable to assume this highly classified special access information   …     will compromise the sources and methods by which we collect intelligence. ” Elaborating, Gaffney stated, “That gets people killed. It can cost us perhaps billions of dollars in stuff that we will lose, and therefore, will not be able to rely upon to protect us in the future. ” Gaffney also said letting Hillary Clinton walk away clean is “an indictment of the administration, not the exoneration of Hillary Clinton. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
