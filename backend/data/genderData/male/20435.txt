Columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that if President Obama’s executive actions on immigration are upheld United States v. Texas “It’ll mean that the Congress has no role” and a Republican president could tell the IRS to avoid collecting capital gains taxes using the same logic the Obama administration uses on Monday’s “Special Report” on the Fox News Channel.  Krauthammer said, [relevant remarks begin around 3:15] “[T]he policy here is irrelevant. It is about the encroachment of the president on powers that aren’t his.   …     And as was said by the attorney who’s bringing the case, [Attorney General] Ken Paxton of Texas (R) the president, himself has admitted, over and over again, that this is outside his powers. I think this is an extremely important case. There’s no way  —   I think it’ll be a split. It’ll go back. So, in this case, it’ll be upheld. But in the future, we have a case where you could have a Republican president who believes in abolishing the capital gains tax, Congress says no, and he then prioritizes IRS collections, and say[s] ‘Don’t collect the capital gains tax,’ doing exactly what Obama’s doing. It’ll mean that the Congress has no role. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
