Airplane   into Hudson River all aboard reported safe, The life story of Capt. Chesley ”Sully” Sullenberger will be brought to the screen, Warner Bros. Pictures announced Tuesday. (Warner Bros. Pictures and CNN are both Time Warner properties.) The film will be adapted from ”Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters,” by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow. The movie promises to capture the    drama surrounding Sullenberger’s landing of the US Airways plane unpowered in the Hudson River after multiple bird strikes. All 155 people aboard the flight survived.  ”I am very glad my story is in the hands of gifted storyteller and filmmaker Clint Eastwood, and veteran producers Allyn Stewart and Frank Marshall,” Sullenberger said in a news release.
