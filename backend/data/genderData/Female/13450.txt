Monday on CNN’s “Wolf,” Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said there was “growing momentum” for replacing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the same day of its repeal.  Paul said, “There is a consensus position on the vast majority of what Republicans do for replacement. We’re putting it together, and we will put it forward. I will do everything in my power to have a vote on it the day we repeal Obamacare, I want a vote on replacement. And we’ll see where I get with that, but there’s a growing momentum both among Senate Republicans and among House Republicans that we should vote on replacement the same day we vote on repeal. ”
