A Maryland school bus driver played the role of hero Monday after her bus caught fire.  Video of the school bus on fire was captured on   footage by volunteer chief of Branchville Volunteer Fire Company in College Park, MD. The driver, identified as Reneita Smith, was safely able to get each and every student off of the bus and away from harm. “A big THANK YOU to our school bus driver Reneita Smith who just saved 20 elementary school kids from a bus fire that completely destroyed the bus,” Fazlul Kabir wrote on Facebook. “Reneita [not only] took each one of the 20 kids from the bus one by one, but also went into the empty bus again to check if everyone was out, while it was still burning. ” Kabir added, that Smith told him, “I am a mom of two kids. It’s my job to save them. ” The cause of the fire is currently under investigation. (  Fox 8) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
