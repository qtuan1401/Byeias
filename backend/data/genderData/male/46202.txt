Last year a group of researchers led by Igor Yelstov of the  said the mysterious disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle were the effects of hydrant gas reactions.’ ’Yelstov told  that when the craters start to actively decompose, methane ice is transformed into gas. He said the process happens the same way that avalanches occur and are almost like a nuclear reaction that produces huge amounts of gas.’ ’If the theory of methane gas explosions being the cause of so many disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle proves to be correct, then we can chalk one up for science. But would the theory explain the magnetic anomalies associated with the area? It will be interesting to hear what is decided at the meeting in April.’ ’Scientists may have solved an enduring mystery. ..’
