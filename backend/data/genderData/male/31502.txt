Reports have begun spreading across Twitter that the opening of the new Ghostbusters reboot has opened to empty theaters across the country. [The tweets began on the opening day of the Paul   feminist blockbuster. Twitter users posted photos and videos of empty theaters with hashtags such as #EmptyScreening and #TicketSalesGoingWell.  Below are just a few examples of these tweets.    Given that whether or not the film will be released in China, a huge film market, has yet to be decided, the success of the 80s reboot is far from certain. Given the fan reaction to the film even before it’s release, with it becoming the most disliked video of all time on YouTube, Ghostbusters toys being moved to the clearance aisle before the film was even released and the accusatory and sexist marketing that was used to promote the film, the signs for Paul Feig’s feminist flick aren’t good.
