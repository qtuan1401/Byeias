On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “At This Hour,” Senator Chris Coons ( ) clarified his prior comments that he regretted changes to the filibuster rule made by Democrats by saying that he regretted that Republicans “overused” the filibuster, which led the Democrats to feel “compelled” to change the rules.  Coons said, “What I regretted was that   Leader [Senator] McConnell ( ) so overused the filibuster to block every major nominee by the Obama administration, to the DC Circuit, the NLRB, and to many other vital posts, that we ultimately, as a Democratic caucus, felt compelled to make that change. What I regretted was that we had a dysfunctional Senate where the minority leader and minority caucus at the time, the Republican caucus, so thoroughly and effectively misused the filibuster to block President Obama, that we ultimately took the step of changing that rule in the Senate. ” (  WFB) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
