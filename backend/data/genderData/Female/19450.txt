Police departments are cracking down on meth users in a comical way. [Police departments are warning meth users that their supply may be contaminated by the Zika virus and are offering to test the meth for free, according to WREG.  The Bath Township Police Department in Michigan, for example, released a social media post on Tuesday offering to check the meth for Zika: “We have read reports online about meth possibly containing the Zika virus! We DO NOT want this to happen to you. If you recently bought some meth, you can bring it into the Bath Township Police Department and we can test it for you. Your safety is our #1 priority!” the post reads. Although the post was humorous, the police department said the goal is to reach out to drug users so they can get help. “While this post was made with a bit of humor, we take the health and safety of Bath Township very seriously, and our main goal here is to reach out to those suffering from addiction and point them in the direction of care,” the Bath Township Police Department wrote in a Facebook comment. The police department’s post has been shared more than 2, 000 times. The Bath Township Police Department is not the first to do this kind of outreach to drug users. The Statham Police Department of Georgia and the Salley Police Department of South Carolina also had similar Facebook posts, offering to test meth for the Zika virus.
