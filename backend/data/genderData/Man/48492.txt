’  ’ ’   Billionaire businessman Mark Cuban said Apple ”needed” the   release of the newly revealed iPhone 7, even if ”it wasn’’t   revolutionary.” ’ ’   The owner of the NBA’’s Dallas Mavericks and the star of ABC’’s   ”Shark Tank” gave his thoughts on the iPhone 7 in an interview   with Business Insider on Monday. ’ ’   ”I mean they needed it,” he said. ”Their iPhone sales have been   on the downswing.” ’ ’   ”Even if it wasn’’t revolutionary  —   or even evolutionary  —   there’’s   a natural upgrade cycle and a natural ecosystem that some segment   and some percentage of their customer base will take advantage   of,” he continued. ”So it was a business necessity.” ’ ’   He compared Apple’’s new phone to the ”old days with PCs,” saying   that when computers advanced from ”1 gigahertz to 1. 5 gigahertz,   it wasn’’t revolutionary but it supported the upcoming cycle.” ’ ’  ’ ’ the iPhone 7 is relatively unchanged from previous   editions aside from slight improvements, most notably to the   camera and the processor. The headline of that article, however,   said the device would ”sell like hotcakes anyway.” ’ ”   The most publicized change that Apple’s phone underwent was the   removal of the headphone jack. The company is now selling a set   of wireless headphones called AirPods for $159. ” ’   Cuban said that while there has been a lot of commotion over the   headphones, ”it’’ll work itself out” and the feature has only a   finite amount of time of being controversial before everyone gets   used to it. ’
