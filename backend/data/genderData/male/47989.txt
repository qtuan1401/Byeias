’  ’ ’   A fire engulfed a bar in northern France, killing at least 13   people and injuring six others, CNN and the Associated Press   reported Friday night. ’ ’   It happened overnight Friday into Saturday morning local time, in   the city of Rouen in Normandy. ’ ’   Witnesses who spoke to CNN said emergency vehicles set up a   perimeter around the Le Cuba Libre bar on Avenue Jacques Cartier. ’ ’   The bar had apparently been rented out for a birthday party, Le   Monde . ’ ’   The newspaper, citing French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve,   said more than 50 firefighters were called to the scene. ’ ’   Cazeneuve said a judicial inquiry was opened as investigators   look at what caused the fire. Local deputy prosecutor, Laurent   Labadie,  the fire may have been accidental, and   several reports suggest that candles on a birthday cake may have   started the blaze after setting fire to flammable sound   insulation in the ceiling of the bar. ’ ’   Terrorism has been ruled out by the authorities, according to    and  ’ ’  ’ ’   Terrorist attacks have plagued France and Germany over the past   few weeks. Last month  after a man rammed a   refrigerated truck into crowds enjoying Bastille Day festivities,   and just last week  in a knife attack on a Catholic church in   Normandy. ’ ’   Both of those attacks were claimed by ISIS, the terrorist group   also known as the Islamic State, ISIL, or Daesh. ’ ’ Barbara Tasch contributed to this report. ’
