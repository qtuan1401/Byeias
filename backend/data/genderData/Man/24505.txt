Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said Saturday that on his first day of office he will, “rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done. ”[Speaking at Saturday’s Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire, Cruz blasted President Obama for his use of executive action.  “You know, there are three avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country, Cruz said. “The first is executive power, the second is foreign policy, and the third is legislation. Executive power, as we all know, has been the preferred vehicle of President Obama, abusing his authority, abusing his constitutional authority. ” “Now, the silver lining of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, so I have pledged on day one I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done,” Cruz added. “That means on day one his efforts to restrict the Second Amendment go away with the strike of a pen. That means on day one his illegal executive amnesty goes away with the strike of a pen. ”
