’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Sodium is much more abundant than lithium and its salt (sodium   carbonate) is ten times cheaper than the equivalent lithium salt.   As the costs of the electrodes and electrolyte take up more than   50% of the cost of a typical cell, batteries using     reactions will have a key advantage in that respect. Sodium ion   batteries can also be completely discharged without damaging the   active materials and without creating a hazard  —   unlike lithium   ion batteries,  if stored   without charge in them. ’ ’   With these developments in   lithium and sodium   technology, we can expect to see electric vehicle batteries with   higher energy densities and lower costs than the ones recently   revealed by Tesla. But that doesn’t mean we’ll necessarily see   them in all electric cars. An alternative strategy would be to   put more effort into  of   the vehicles by  so   they can carry more batteries. This could potentially get us to   the range of more than 350 miles in a single charge without the   need for a new type of battery. But whatever the innovation is,   Tesla and other manufacturers still need a final advance to put   electric vehicles within reach of ordinary drivers.  ’
