A New York City lawyer is suing his socialite neighbor to force her to turn off what he says is nonstop Christmas music blaring from a loudspeaker through her Christmas display, the New York Post reported. [“It’s not like she plays it a   every day,” said Nick Wilder, who’s representing himself in the case. “It’s on from 7 a. m. to midnight.  I like a Christmas song on Christmas Day. But I’m tired of hearing ‘Jingle Bells’ like 700 or 800 times a day. ”  Wilder said Lisa Marie Falcone, whose husband is   billionaire Phillip Falcone, owns three adjoining town houses across the street from his apartment on the Upper East Side. “She’s a prima donna who thinks she can do anything she wants without consideration for anybody,” Wilder said. “She’s invading other people’s homes with her elevator music. ” Wilder is seeking an injunction to force her to stop playing the music. Falcone did not respond to the Post‘s requests for comment. Other neighbors have commented on the display, with some applauding Wilder’s actions while others think Falcone’s display is no big deal. “To have somebody projecting the music into your home is not right,” one neighbor told CBS New York. “I hear no noise,” another neighbor told the station. “I passed here this morning. It’s very soft. ” This isn’t the first time Falcone has upset the neighbors with her holiday displays. In 2014, she put up Halloween decorations that included an old woman holding a dead baby.
