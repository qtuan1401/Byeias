Metallica lead singer James Hetfield says he moved from San Francisco to the Colorado Rockies in part because “showing up with a deer on the bumper” is frowned upon in Marin County. [During an interview with talk radio host Joe Rogan, Hetfield says he got tired of the “elitist” attitudes in the Bay Area.  The Daily Mail quoted Hetfield saying, “I kind of got sick of the Bay Area, the attitudes of the people there, a little bit. They talk about how diverse they are, and things like that, and it’s fine if you’re diverse like them. But showing up with a deer on the bumper doesn’t fly in Marin County. ” “My form of eating organic doesn’t vibe with theirs,” he added, a clear reference to his love for hunting. Hetfield summed things up by saying, “There was an elitist attitude there  —   that if you weren’t their way politically, their way environmentally, all of that, that you were looked down upon. ” So he and his wife relocated to Vail, Colorado the area in which his wife grew up and a place where opportunities to enjoy nature and to hunt abound. He said he loved the ocean in the Bay Area and even loved the area itself, but said the attitude of the people made him “feel like [he] was just fighting all the time” and he had to escape. It is interesting to note that Hetfield stressed that he and his fellow members are not about making political statements, and that he was not trying to make one by explaining his reasons for leaving the Bay Area. Rather, he said Metallica is about music and the music speaks for them.
