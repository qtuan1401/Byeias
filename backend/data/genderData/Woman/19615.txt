A recent girls soccer game in Elkhorn, Wisconsin, was suspended after a group of Elkhorn students directed a series of   chants at Latino students on the opposing team. [The opposing team, Beloit Memorial High School, asked the game’s referees to suspend the game after the chants rendered Beloit’s student athletes incapable of returning to the field. High school soccer rules allow referees to suspend play due to “outside interference. ”  “They came off the field and weren’t able to finish the game because they were too upset and distraught over what happened to them,” Denu said. “One of the girls was cradled in the arms of one of our assistant coaches for a good 15 to 20 minutes. ” The fans allegedly chanted “build a wall,” “no comprende,” and “speak English. ” Elkhorn high school administrators hold that there were only “one or two” students responsible for the chants at the game, and that they are investigating the incident so that they can isolate and deal with those who were responsible for the comments. Elkhorn administrators called the comments “offensive” and “inappropriate. ” Beloit coach Brian Denu, who is white, claims that the chants greatly upset all of his players. “Those are just words you’ll never be able to take back from those kids and an experience that you wish you could take back,” he said. “It was really disturbing for them. ” Tom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
