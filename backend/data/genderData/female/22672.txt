California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who ordered the search of David Daleiden’s apartment, is a longtime supporter of Planned Parenthood. [She has perhaps targeted Daleiden and his Center for Medical Progress because his video exposés of Planned Parenthood’s   scheme has roiled public support for the abortion giant. Daleiden and his colleagues recorded several Planned Parenthood personnel negotiating the sale of unborn baby livers, hearts, blood and even brains.  Several states have voted to defund Planned Parenthood and Planned Parenthood is under investigation by a committee of the House of Representatives. Besides going after Daleiden for the past several months, Harris is also running for the Senate from California, and on her campaign site is a petition to support Planned Parenthood: For many, the new year is a chance for a fresh start  —   but not for some in Washington. It is Congress’s first week back, and apparently, they haven’t reshuffled their priorities. They voted to defund Planned Parenthood. We can all agree on one thing. Washington is broken. Voting to strip federal funding from an organization that provides vital health services to 2. 7 million Americans is the epitome of dysfunction. Once again, we need you to take a stand and join Kamala in defending Planned Parenthood. Sign our petition to protect this organization and the important work it does. A source within the Daleiden camp says he has produced thousands of pages of documents in response to Harris’s demands. In a statement released yesterday, Daleiden says representatives of Harris’s office ignored documents in his apartment that prove his case that Planned Parenthood and Stem Express colluded in buying and selling internal organs of unborn children.
