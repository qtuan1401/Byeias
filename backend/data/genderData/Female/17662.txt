Monday in Jacksonville, FL on the eve of the Florida GOP Primary, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said the results of tomorrow’s voting will “shock the country. ”  Rubio said, “Tomorrow is the day. Tomorrow’s the day when we’re going to shock the country. We’re going to do what needs to be done. We’re going to win the 99 delegates here in Florida, and it’s going to give us the momentum we need to go into Arizona and Utah and beyond. Because what’s at stake is too important. All these elections are important, but what is at stake in this election is the definition and identity of our country and of our party. The Republican party is the home of the conservative movement. It is not the home of anger. It is not the home of frustration. It is not the home of politicians who try to take advantage of what’s wrong in people’s lives. it is the home of people who understand our problems and acknowledge them, but also understand our solutions. That understand if we solve our problems, we have a chance to be greater than we have ever been. The   century is made for us and we Americans, we can do anything. We have proven that for over two centuries. And now the time has come for this generation to prove it as well. Tomorrow we have a chance to make a powerful statement to the country And that is that the Republican party is not going to allow itself to the hijacked by a fake conservative and people who go around dividing us against each other. ”
