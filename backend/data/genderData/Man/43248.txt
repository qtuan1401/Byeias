’  ’ ’   Lyft may be preparing to take its   service   global, its first expansion beyond its US home turf and an   important step in its competition with Uber, according to   .  ’ ’   Citing a source familiar with the plans, CNBC reported that Lyft   has international ambitions, as evidenced by its updates to its   international partnerships today.  ’ ’   The   company has been in an international alliance   with fellow   Ola, Didi, and Grab, which operate in   India, China, and Southeast Asia respectively. Previously as part   of their partnership, visitors from those countries to the   US could open their native    app and be able to   hail a Lyft without needing to download a new app for the country   they were visiting.  ’ ’   Now, a message will prompt international users to download the   Lyft app separately  —   a move seen as an indicator it could be   looking to enter those markets with its own service as   well.  ’ ’   According to CNBC, an announcement of its global ambitions is   expected sometime this year. For the past five years, Lyft has   operated strictly within the US while Uber has gone global,   operating  around the world. Lyft’’s president John Zimmer   called 2016 a ”breakout” year for the company after it  from 53 million in 2015 to 160 million this   last year. ’ ’   Lyft declined to comment. ’
