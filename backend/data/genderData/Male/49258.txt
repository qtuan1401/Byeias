’  ’ ’   Over the last three games, Stephen Curry has scored 103 points   and made 24  . There are 26 teams who have made   fewer threes this week. ’ ”   Curry’s latest outing was a        explosion in just 30 minutes, as the Golden State Warriors beat   the Denver Nuggets  . ” ’   The Warriors have won three games in a row and are beginning   to look more comfortable with one another, thanks in part to   Curry looking like the   reigning MVP again. ’ ”   It’s been a while since we’ve seen Curry in this form. Injuries   slowed him down in the playoffs, as he lost his usual bounce that   can make him such a dangerous weapon on the offensive end. Over   the first six games of the   campaign, Curry played well,   but there was something missing. 23 points per game on 44%   shooting is nothing to sneeze at, but   the way Curry was playing was not himself. ” ”   That seems to be in the rearview now  —   Curry has found his game,   in particular, the swagger that allows him to take, and make,   wild shots and seemingly crush opponents’ confidence. Curry found   it in the third quarter of Thursday’s game, scoring 15 points   with    shooting from deep. ” ’ ’ ’ ’ ”   When Curry’s hitting these shots, and running back on defense   before they go in, it’s over. ” ’ ’ ”   Curry even attempted one shot from just past   which   missed. Warriors coach Steve Kerr wasn’t even angry. ” ’   ”I’ve seen it all [from Steph] but it’s still entertaining as   hell,” Kerr said (). ”That one shot he took [near half   court] I’ve seen him do it many times, but it never gets old.” ’ ’   Said Curry, ”Honestly it was a dumb shot. I probably should have     from somewhere closer. I had Draymond [Green] egging   me on the whole way down the court. So it was like that demon and   angel on your shoulders: Which one are you going to listen to?   Obviously it would have been fun to make it, but I think I’m like      on the year,    on the year on shots like that, so I   might need to reassess that.” ’ ’   Over the last three games, the Warriors are leading the league in   offensive rating, scoring 121 points per 100 possessions. With   Curry on the floor the last three games, that number jumps to   124. 6. ’ ’   After maybe overthinking his role on offense with the     Warriors to begin the season, Steph is back to being Steph, and   the Warriors look fine.  ’
