Former GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff said that he and others have been incarcerated for the same activities Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was involved in through her activities with the Clinton Foundation while secretary of state. [“[Clinton] is the most corrupt person in the history of the United States to get this close to the presidency, including by leaps and bounds [former President] Warren Harding,” Abramoff said during an interview with “The Jamie Weinstein Show” published Thursday.  Abramoff said that Clinton had some improper dealings between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department while she served as secretary of state. “Her staff  —   Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin  —   were very involved in facilitating donors getting special access,” he said. “Even if all of the money that she extracted and [former President Bill Clinton] extracted from these world leaders in exchange for the favors they did in the State Department went to altruistic purposes, it is still improper. ” Abramoff said Clinton’s supporters are glossing over what could be serious wrongdoing on Clinton’s part. “Just getting the meeting, getting the access, getting use over government public service employees by virtue of your contributions, that is special access,” he said. “That may not be statutory bribery but that is certainly absolutely honest services fraud, without question. ” “Anybody who looks at that and says, ‘Well, that’s perfectly okay’ is either lying because they’re trying to support Hillary, hypocritical or they just don’t understand what’s going on in Washington,” Abramoff added. Abramoff served four years out of a six year prison sentence for conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion. He pleaded guilty to these charges in 2006. Abramoff is just one of many critics who have said Clinton’s ties to the foundation could cause a conflict of interest in her presidency.
