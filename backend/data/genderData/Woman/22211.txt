At a Monday campaign event for his wife in South Florida, former President Bill Clinton reportedly compared Sen. Bernie Sanders’s ( ) supporters to the Tea Party movement on the right, according to the Palm Beach Post:  . @billclinton compares @SenSanders supporters in Democratic Party to tea party in the GOP,  —   George Bennett (@gbennettpost) February 15, 2016,  Hillary Clinton cancelled her appearance at the rally to campaign in Nevada ahead of its caucuses after Sanders trounced Clinton in New Hampshire. Like the Tea Party movement that challenged the Republican establishment and the crony capitalism associated with the bipartisan permanent political class, Sanders and his supporters have been railing against Hillary Clinton’s ties to the Wall Street. At last Thursday’s PBS debate, when Clinton tried to claim that she is not beholden to Wall Street despite receiving millions in speaking fees and campaign contributions, Sanders said, “Let’s not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren’t dumb. ” “Why does Wall Street make huge political contributions?” he continued. “I guess just for fun. They just want to throw it around. ” On Fox News Sunday, when asked if Wall Street was influencing Clinton with campaign donations, Sanders responded, “Obviously, I don’t think there’s any debate. ” Wadi Gaitan, a spokesman for the Florida Republican Party, said that, “Hillary Clinton’s last minute decision to skip Florida is a clear sign that her campaign is in crisis after her devastating loss to Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. ” “No matter how much the Clinton machine tries to spin their bleeding support, Floridian voters continue to see the catastrophe of dishonesty, scandals and negative headlines plaguing her campaign,” Gaitan added.
