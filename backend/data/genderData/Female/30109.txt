During a town hall event Wednesday in Oskaloosa, Iowa, GOP 2016 contender Carly Fiorina said Republicans have been involved in creating education programs such as Common Core, No Child Left Behind, and Race to the Top that, ultimately, amount to “crony capitalism. ”[As Shane Vander Hart at The Pulse 2016 reports, the former   CEO said:  All these programs, some of them have come out under Republicans too  —   Common Core, No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, they are all bad ideas. Because, guess what they are? They are big bureaucratic programs coming out of Washington and, by the way, there are a bunch of interests who helped write those programs. In the case of Common Core, guess who helped write it? Textbook companies and the testing companies. It’s all crony capitalism folks. It’s alive and well under Republicans and Democrats. We have to take our country back. Fiorina has spoken against Common Core since announcing her candidacy. However, as The Pulse 2016 also observed, when Fiorina was running for a Senate seat in California in 2010, her campaign released a document that praised the Race to the Top (RttT) stimulus program. RttT is the vehicle that was used by the Obama administration to incentivize states to sign onto the Common Core, promising federal cash for states that agreed to a set of “  and   standards” and associated testing, teacher evaluations, and student data collection systems. Fiorina’s presidential campaign, however, said the plan that was initially proposed  —   and that won the candidate’s support  —   was not as promised and was simply more federal bureaucracy.
