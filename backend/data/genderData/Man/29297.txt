Update: Madonna is drunk and yelling at the Yum Center managers from stage.  —   Michael Ellis (@ThoughtsOfGing) January 17, 2016,  This concert experience has been one of the weirdest in my life. I’m pretty sure Madonna is hammered drunk on stage.  —   Macauley Miller (@MacMiller1991) January 17, 2016,  Never seen so many people walk out and leave a show early. What was a sold out show has now become a show with lots of empty seats,  —   Macauley Miller (@MacMiller1991) January 17, 2016,  @Barron_Hope @Madonna wow. I can understand being a little late, but that long? ?? No thanks.  —   larren (@kisseslikekreme) January 17, 2016,  Madonna also allegedly mocked her Kentuckian audience by speaking in a southern accent. Why is #Madonna speaking with a southern accent?  —   Molly Owens (@mollylovesteddy) January 17, 2016,  Think I’m offended by @Madonna and her hillbilly accent at the Louisville concert. What a hag,  —   Andrew Carroll (@CarrollJAndrew) January 17, 2016,  Another fan said, “Madonna was an awesome performer but man she was a   !  …     trashed talked Kentuckians and spoke in a fake hillbilly accent. ” The singer took to her Instagram page on Sunday to claim media reports of her being intoxicated were fabricated as part of a sexist attack against her.  Working on my stand up laying down. Good  practice! !! 👍🏻Thanks Louisville! 😂 the tears of a clown soon to follow the ❤️#rebelheartour and for those people who like to believe all they read i never drink and perform! !! My show is 2 hours  and  15 minutes of non stop singing and dancing. In Louisville I made a joke about doing a stand comedy act dressed as a clown and being able to drink alcohol. Its so very interesting how society continues to not only treat me in a totally sexist way (if i a were a man no one would have said a thing) and also continue to take everything i say literally! Thats what happens when people don’t read  books and get all information from TMZ.
