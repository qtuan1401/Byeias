Traffic deaths in the United States rose 10. 4 percent in the first half of this year compared with the same period in 2015, maintaining a steady climb. The numbers were released on Wednesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which noted that Americans drove about 50. 5 billion more miles in the first six months of 2016 than in the first half of 2015, an increase of 3. 3 percent. But that does not account for the rise in the number of deaths: to 17, 775 in the first six months of 2016 from 16, 100 in the same period in 2015. Officials have not identified a specific cause for the most recent increase. “It is too soon to attribute contributing factors or potential implications of any changes in deaths on our roadways,” the agency said. The dire statistics were the latest bad news from the traffic safety administration. Beginning in the final months of 2014, the rate of fatalities has increased for seven consecutive quarters compared with the corresponding quarters of previous years. The statistics were released as federal officials announced a “Road to Zero” coalition that aims to eliminate traffic deaths, including those on sidewalks and bicycle paths, by 2046. The Department of Transportation said it would commit $3 million over the next three years for grants to provide   help, such as promoting the use of seatbelts and installing rumble strips. But advanced technology, like the introduction of driverless cars, figures to play prominently in the   plans. The Obama administration announced new guidelines in September that encourage the development of the technology while promising strong safety oversight. Still, the view that computers can operate vehicles more safely than humans was tested when a Tesla Model S electric sedan crashed and killed its driver in June while the car was in   mode.
