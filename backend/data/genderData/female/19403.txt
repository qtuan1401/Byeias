Thomas Frank writes in The Guardian that the WikiLeaks emails to and from Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta “offer an unprecedented view into the workings of the elite, and how it looks after itself. ” They provide “a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers. ”[From The Guardian:  This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should “come from the industry itself”. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration.

The friends all succeed. They break every boundary. But the One Big Boundary remains. Yes, it’s all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you aren’t part of this happy, prosperous    —   if you don’t have John Podesta’s email address  —   you’re out. Read the rest here.
