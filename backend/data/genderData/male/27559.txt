Ohio Governor John Kasich (R) has rejected a Cleveland Police request that he take executive action to ban openly carried firearms during at the Republican Convention this week. [Cleveland Police Union president  Steve Loomis signaled that lawyers were compiling the request for Governor Kasich. But Kasich’s press secretary makes clear the request will be rejected.  According to Fox 59, the request was motivated by the shooting deaths of three officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday. But a statement from press secretary Emmalee Kalmbach says that while Kasich laments the death of the officers and the divide that continues between officers and many of those they are protected, he is not able to suspend the carry rights of Ohioans. Right Wing Reports tweeted Kalmbach’statement: Law enforcement is a noble, essential calling and we all grieve that we’ve again seen attacks on officers. Ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested. The bonds between communities and our police must be reset and rebuilt —  as we’re doing in Ohio —  so our communities and officers can both be safe. Everyone has an important role to play in that renewal. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
