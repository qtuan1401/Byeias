There is a flurry of activity around each booth as dogs are primped for competition. A walk behind the scenes at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show can be overwhelming. But a close look reveals what makes each breed unique. Above, Pippa, an English setter. Glitter is a      Chinese   owned by Deborah Camp of East Haddam, Conn. Glitter’s official name is Grand Champion Camp Wrinkles Stairway to Heaven. Chinese   known for their wrinkly skin, are said to date from the Han dynasty (206 B. C.  A. D.) in China. The foot of Kickstart, a bulldog. The nonsporting group was won by a bulldog in last year’s show. Duo, an Australian shepherd. The eyes of the Australian shepherd vary in color, a notable characteristic of the breed. The tail of Whizz, a    Finnish spitz. Part of the nonsporting group, the breed has long been used to hunt small game and birds and is known for its bushy tail. Preston, a    puli, has won 95    titles, according to The Associated Press. The herding breed is known for its long, cordlike coat. Sancho is a Xoloitzcuintli, a Mexican hairless breed revered by the Mayans and known for its   name. Jack is a standard Manchester terrier, a breed originally trained to hunt rats in Manchester, England. Pilot, a chow chow, won best in breed.
