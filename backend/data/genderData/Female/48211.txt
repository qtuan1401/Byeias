’  ’ ’   There is way too much cheese in America, so the US   Department of Agriculture is buying a massive amount of it. ’ ’   According to a release from the USDA, it will buy 11 million   pounds  —   worth roughly $20 million by its estimate  —   and   distribute it to food banks around the country. ’ ’   The US cheese market has had  for most of the   year because foreign buyers have looked elsewhere for   their dairy products as a result of the strong dollar.   Before this slowdown in exports, many farmers had ramped up their   production because of   prices. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   According to Joe Schmit, head trader and cofounder at Dairy   Opportunities, the government support makes sense given the   recent moves of the commodity. ’ ’   Over the summer, the price of cheese rallied about   30% despite a seemingly large buildup in inventories.   It appears that traders were speculating that the government was   going to step in. ’ ’   And while it did, the    purchase, however, is   only 1% of the inventory built up, according to Schmit. Combined   with the fact that the buy is smaller than expected, it may lead   to a drop in prices in the coming days. ’ ’   ”The government made a much smaller buy than originally thought,   and the price was slightly lower than where it was trading,” said   Schmit. ”For those reasons, I wouldn’’t be surprised if there was   some sell pressure.” ’ ’   Additionally, said Schmit, the government consistently buys   smaller amounts of cheese for its programs and has even done   these sorts of special   buys in the past, so the   support for dairy farmers is not unprecedented. ’ ’   ”It’’s not surprising to see the government giving the cheese   market a little boost,” concluded Schmit. ’
