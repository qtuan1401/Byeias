Popular porn website XHamster has offered Gawker founder Nick Denton $35, 000 if he agrees to perform in a porn video having sex with a man dressed as Hulk Hogan. [“Gawker Media has filed for bankruptcy but porn site xHamster. com wants closure” wrote XHamster in a press release emailed to Breitbart Tech.  “The popular   destination announced today that it is offering Gawker CEO Nick Denton payment of $25, 000 to film a sex tape between him and his husband Derrence Washington, or any other man or woman of Denton’s choosing”. In order to get the extra $10, 000, XHamster requests that “Washington wears a Hulkamania shirt and shouts Hulk Hogan’s trademark line, “Whatcha gonna do when Hulkmania runs wild on you?” while penetrating his husband. ” Gawker were ordered by the courts to pay former wrestler Hulk Hogan $140 million after the news outlet posted Hogan’s sex tape without consent. Gawker has since declared bankruptcy, with Denton being forced to put up his New York apartment on the market. “The   Hogan saga began with porn and should end with porn” said XHamster spokesperson Mike Kulich. “xHamster. com has taken a strong position on responsible porn. It troubles us that sex tapes have gotten a bad name from Gawker’s actions  …     The First Amendment doesn’t give Gawker, xHamster, or anyone else permission to illegal film people in the privacy of their homes  …     It’s just wrong to take videos of people having sex and put them online without their consent. How dumb do you have to be to think otherwise?” Denton has not publicly responded to XHamster’s offer. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.
