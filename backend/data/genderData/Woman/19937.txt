Actor Jonah Hill probably didn’t expect to become the butt of jokes while appearing on French television to promote his latest film, War Dogs. [But that’s exactly what happened when French TV personality Ornella Fleury repeatedly poked fun at the actor during an interview on the CanalPlus program Le Grand Journal this week.   “When I saw you get sodomized by a    demon in This Is the End, I told myself, ‘Now that’s the man of my dreams’!” Fleury, known as “Miss Mateo” on the program, told the actor in French, with a translator providing Hill the English translation through an earpiece. Hill responded by telling Fleury he hears she gets sodomized “pretty often,” but apparently she didn’t hear the comment as she continued to mock him. “Anyway, that’s why I have a sexual fantasy with you, Jonah,” she went on. “My sexual fantasy would be that we’d meet up in a hotel room at night. We would chat, you’d make me laugh. You’d make me laugh a lot. And then all of a sudden, you’d bring your friends DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, and then you’d go away!” Hill was apparently not amused by the comments, firing back: “I’m glad I came to this show to get ridiculed by your local weather girl. ” Hill conducted the interview alongside his War Dogs   Miles Teller. Hill and Teller play slackers in their   who find themselves in over their heads when they win a massive   contract with the United States government. The video of the interview quickly racked up nearly 700, 000 views in just a few days. Fleury later apologized for the interview in a statement: ““I really had the impression that I knew you. I thought I was just messing around with a friend, but the reality is that we are not friends. ” Watch video of the awkward exchange above.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
