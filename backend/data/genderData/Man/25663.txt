Nearly 800, 000 users’ information has been exposed in a data breach of the porn site Brazzers. [The user data appears to have been taken from the Brazzers forum, however many users used the same login details for the forum as they did for the main site, leaving many people exposed.  The data leak is said to have included email addresses, usernames, and unencrypted passwords, which most websites typically encrypt or hash in case of leak scenarios. This means that users on the porn site who have used the same email address and password on other sites may be vulnerable to attacks elsewhere. “Problem with a hack like that is it’s a *forum*. Worse than just adult website creds, this is what people were talking   fantasising about,” said security researcher Troy Hunt on Twitter, highlighting the fact that users’ specific sexual fetishes and fantasies could now be leaked into the open. The leak, which actually happened in 2013 but has only just been discovered, was reportedly due to the forum’s vBulletin software. Brazzers confirmed vBulletin to be the cause of the vulnerability and is currently taking “corrective measures” to protect its users and their information from cyber criminals.
