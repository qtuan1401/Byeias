Pulse, the Orlando gay nightclub targeted in a jihadist terror attack, was a “  zone” by state law. [Per Florida’s concealed carry law, those with a license to carry may not carry their firearms into an establishment that serves alcohol.  The establishment was touted as “Orlando’s hottest gay bay” on its website, providing patrons with an “unforgettable night of fun and fantasy. ” Domestic terrorist Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, a registered Democrat and Muslim from Port St. Lucie, killed 50 victims and wounded 53 more  —   all of whom were prohibited from carrying weapons to defend themselves. The state statute that covers the license to carry a weapon, Title XLVI Chapter 790, clearly states that guns are not permitted in bars. Section (12)(a) tells concealed carry license holders that “A license issued under this section does not authorize any person to openly carry a handgun or carry a concealed weapon or firearm into: Any portion of an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, which portion of the establishment is primarily devoted to such purpose. ”
