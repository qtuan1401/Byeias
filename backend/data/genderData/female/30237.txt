In a Sunday evening interview on Breitbart News Daily, influential Iowa Congressman Steve King slammed   favorite Marco Rubio for continuing to embrace the policies outlined in his   2013 Gang of Eight bill.[  In the interview, Breitbart News’ Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle brought up Rubio’s recent declaration that illegal immigrants should be allowed to remain in the country. King, who was one of the fiercest opponents of the 2013   bill, said: “What he [Rubio] has done is he’s embraced the Gang of Eight bill in the core of its entirety. The Gang of Eight bill was always about amnesty. ” King continued: “When he [Rubio] says that tired language of, ‘We can’t deport 12 million people’  …     that’s the code word that tells —   especially the   people —   ‘okay, he’s going to put his lot with them. ’” King explained that Rubio “has repudiated no part of the Gang of Eight bill. He was the face and voice for the Gang of Eight bill,” King said. “I think he came into the Senate as being opposed to amnesty, for border security, for restoring the rule of law, and when he got around  …     [to the Gang of Eight,] he shifted his position 180 degrees and became the advocate —   the spokesman —   out before the press. He was the face and the voice of the Gang Of Eight bill. ” Indeed, Rubio has not repudiated any substantive policy outlined in the Gang of Eight bill, and has, in fact, reiterated his support for giving green cards —  and thus citizenship and welfare —   to illegal aliens, expanding refugee resettlement, and massively increasing the number of   visa issuances.
