During a speech in Warsaw, Poland on Saturday, President Obama argued that America is not as divided as some may say it is and “Americans of all races and all backgrounds” are outraged by both “the inexcusable attacks on police,” and “the larger, persistent problem of   and Latinos being treated differently in our criminal justice system. ”  Obama said, “America is not as divided as some have suggested. Americans of all races and all backgrounds are rightly outraged by the inexcusable attacks on police, whether it’s in Dallas, or any place else. That includes protesters. It includes family members, who have grave concerns about police conduct.   …     There’s no division there. And Americans of all races and all backgrounds are also rightly saddened and angered about the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and about the larger, persistent problem of   and Latinos being treated differently in our criminal justice system. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
