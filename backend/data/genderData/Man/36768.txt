 (CNN) The gunman who killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando in June was shot eight times by police, a medical examiner’s report released Friday shows. Omar Mateen, 29, was hit in the top of the head, abdomen, right calf, twice in the chest and three times in the right foot.  There is no evidence that any of the shots were from close range, according to the report signed by Orange County medical examiner Joshua Stephany.  The gunman at Pulse nightclub was sober. Toxicology tests for drugs and alcohol were negative.  The medical examiner’s office also released autopsy results for 31 of the gunman’s victims. Almost all of them were hit by multiple bullets as the gunman fired with a   rifle on the morning of June 12. Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others just before Pulse closed in the predawn hours.  He exchanged gunfire with a police officer working extra duty and other officers who responded to the initial 911 calls. The  gunman was killed after a standoff that lasted several hours when tactical officers blew a hole in a wall and fatally shot Mateen. The report cited other injuries, including   injuries to the chest. The autopsies reveal the size of each person’s wounds but don’t indicate what caliber rounds were used or whether Mateen fired all the fatal shots.  An anabolic steroid analysis, which is not commonly part of a routine toxicology test, suggests investigators may have had questions about Mateen’s use of steroids.
