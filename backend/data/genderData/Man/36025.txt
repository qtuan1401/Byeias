 (CNN) Haute couture week is one of the most important events on the fashion calendar.  Biannually, internationally renowned fashion houses like Chanel and Christian Dior, as well as newer,   brands such as Bouchra Jarrar and Elie Saab, present painstakingly elaborate and extremely expensive designs behind closed doors to a   audience of editors, buyers and private clients.  Haute couture    or, ”high sewing”    is a legally protected term that can only be used by brands approved by the French Ministry of Industry.  These   garments, created entirely by hand by the industry’s most skilled artisans and craftsman, represent the best quality fashion money can buy. And yes that comes at a price, with certain pieces valued at upwards of $100, 000.  Most people will never buy or wear a piece of couture, nor will they attend a couture fashion show.
