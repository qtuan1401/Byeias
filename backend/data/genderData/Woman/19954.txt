Jimmy LaSalvia at Salon writes that the Republican Party’s audience at the South Carolina GOP debate is like Drudge’s polls —  unscientific and meant to embarrass the opposite wing of the base —  but unlike Drudge’s “army,” it was pitifully small.

The Republican presidential debate in South Carolina on Saturday night was a real knife fight, and it was cheered on by a vocal audience that made us feel like it was held in the Colosseum. It was unbelievable, like a work of fiction, but it wasn’t. The story of last night’s debate can be told as a Tale of Two Audiences.   …     I’ve written before about influence of Matt Drudge and his online poll, and it continues to help paint a picture of the political reality inside the GOP.
