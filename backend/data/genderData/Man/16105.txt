Throughout the NFL, many have mimicked Colin Kaepernick’s kneel down anthem protests. Now, it appears Kaepernick has inspired a former 49er to take a knee for an entirely different reason. [Monday, on the Tolbert and Lund Show on San Francisco’s sports talk station KNBR, former 49er Brent Jones told Niners fans exactly what he thought of Kaepernick’s performance on Sunday, and what it inspired him to do:  “I got to tell you, there was five or six throws yesterday where I took a knee in protest,” Jones jested. “Those are horrific throws for the NFL, or college. ” Kaepernick completed 13 of his 29 passes for 187 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. The quarterback was clinging onto a   lead late in the third quarter despite no running game or defense to help him. “I actually heard yesterday people try and say Kap was decent, and I’m like compared to what?” Jones said. “Are you kidding? Have our expectations sunk so drastically low that you could say that? “You have to be able to make throws. You don’t get 20 chances a game to throw a touchdown pass. And Kap missed a couple yesterday. Torrey Smith on a post route, he zinged it five yards over his head. Poor Torrey Smith. That poor guy must be thinking, are you kidding me? How many times have I been open for touchdowns down the field and none of my quarterbacks can even get the ball within range. ” Kaepernick has maintained that we will continue to see him taking a knee during the national anthem for the foreseeable future. Though, after last Sunday’s performance, it’s hard to see Kaepernick taking a knee in a “victory” formation anytime soon. @themightygwinn
