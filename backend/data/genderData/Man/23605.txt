A man standing on a Middleburg, FL street corner holding up a “Death to America” sign was physically attacked Tuesday, according to an ActionNewsJax report.  The police report states that the other side of the sign says “Because Of Obama’s Policies. ” In the incident, which was caught on camera, a female riding in a passenger seat in a passing gray Nissan Titan reportedly yelled at Charles Brownett, the man holding the yellow sign, “Why don’t you leave America?” Brownett yelled in response, “Give me some money!” The driver of the Titan, the man in the orange shirt, then pulled into a nearby McDonald’s parking lot before walking over to Brownett. He reportedly said to Brownett, “Actually, I like that sign, give it to me. ” The two then struggled over the sign, wrestling each other to the ground. The female passenger then walked over to the scuffle and began kicking Brownett. A fourth man came over to stop the fight, but the man in orange continued to punch the man in the face with a closed fist, according to witnesses. Investigators have identified the two attackers, but no charges have been filed at this time. Authorities said the man with the sign will not face any charges because he was exercising his right to freedom of speech peacefully in a public area and not blocking traffic.
