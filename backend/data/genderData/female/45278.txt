There are  a year in the United States, approximately the same number as deaths from motor vehicle accidents.’ ’The number of firearm deaths has been stable essentially since 2000. There are  or so people injured by firearms annually in the country. These numbers far outstrip the consequences of  with stricter gun regulations.’ ’What ails us? Why do we continue to accept these consequences of firearms when other countries do not?’ ’The discussions in the public space over the past several weeks have illuminated some of these challenges, including a  that is fueled by historical concern with individual rights to gun ownership, and an  that aggressively penalizes legislators who aim to introduce basic gun control regulations.’ ’I would suggest that one more factor that has held us back on this front is the  we have available about firearms and firearm violence.’ ’For example, there exists no national registry of victims of firearm violence, comparable to the  we have to follow victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, or to any number of other . Our understanding of the consequences of gun violence is essentially limited to statistics on firearm deaths and injuries. That’s it.’ ’’ ’While gun violence is a public health problem, it is not studied the same way other public health problems are.’ ’That is because our national health organizations, principally the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have avoided   research for almost 20 years.’ ’The  go back to 1996.

We do not know who the corollary victims of gun violence are, or what the consequences are for this group.’ ’’ ’We do not know the influence of common substances such as alcohol on the risk of firearm homicide or suicide. We do not know the real costs of firearm violence, including physical, mental and community harms linked to firearms.’ ’And, centrally, we do not know the most effective policy levers that we can use to limit the gun violence epidemic simply because we have not done the research to understand the policy measures that can most effectively reduce or prevent gun violence.’ ’This is precisely the kind of public health research that groups like the CDC and NIH fund for pressing public health problems, and should fund for firearm research.’ ’Unfortunately, a shortage of data creates space for  that threatens reasoned public discussion and progressive action on the issue.’ ’There is hope on this issue. President Obama recently  to return to studying the causes of gun violence.’ ’However, the executive action was not accompanied by the dedication of any new money to the issue, and until such funds are available, the CDC, like any other funder, would need to cut spending in some other area to sponsor this research.’ ’’ ’An omnibus spending bill put the funding ban in place, and an omnibus spending bill could also undo it.
