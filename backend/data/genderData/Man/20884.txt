Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” former NBC’s “Nightly News” anchor Tom Brokaw expressed his pessimism about Sen. Marco Rubio’s ( ) chance going forward in this Republican presidential nominating contest.  Brokaw said he didn’t foresee a path forward for Rubio and that his performance Tuesday as the Super Tuesday results were coming in left much to be desired. “It was, and I don’t see where he goes from here,” Brokaw said. “I don’t know if we have the video when he first appeared last night. Right after, it was pretty clear he had a dismal night. He looked like the guy who was running for student council president who found out he didn’t have a date for the prom. He was frozen in place at the point. Very hard to see how he puts something together in which he can stay in place throughout. I think Ted Cruz obviously has a shot at staying in the hunt. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
