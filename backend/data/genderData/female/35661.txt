 (CNN)”I am human, I am love and my heart beats with my   will always win, underneath the skin, everybody’s got a pulse,” artist Melissa Etheridge sings in her tribute to the 49 people who died in the Orlando nightclub shooting. Etheridge says she was so moved by the tragedy that she was compelled to write a rock ballad for all those grieving the lives lost in the attack. The Grammy Award winner and   LGBT member said in an interview Saturday with CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield that she felt a need to respond to the massacre through music. ”Music has always given us a place to put our emotions,” she said. Etheridge released the powerful song, titled ”Pulse” after the Orlando nightclub, within 24 hours after the shooting. It prompted an overflow of compassion. The track has been well received by fans attending the singer’s concerts as part of her United States tour. Etheridge said her Twitter and Facebook accounts have been flooded with an ”outpour of love” after releasing the song. The track will soon be available for purchase with all proceeds being donated to an LGBT charity, Rolling Stone reported. ”Pulse” opens with the lyrics: ”Everybody’s got a pain inside, imaginary wounds they fight to   can I hate them, when everybody’s got a pulse?” She addresses Omar Mateen, the    shooter: ”Who you gonna hate   there’s no one left but   you gonna gun   you can’t kill the   it’s inside of   our   our pulse. Etheridge expressed the hope that the world will become more embracing of human differences. ”Our    struggle is to understand diversity. We all coexist. Diversity is what makes our country strong,” she said. ”Out of blood and ashes we can bring out our inner strength.”
