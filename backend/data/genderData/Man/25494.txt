A Florida father, angry at his    son’s pot habit, is gaining national attention after posting a Craigslist ad to sell the truck he had bought for him because he is using it to “drive around and smoke dope with his friends. ”[Jacksonville father Allan Gieger posted a Craigslist ad that is now going viral after he caught his ungrateful son using the vehicle as a rolling party palace.  Gieger told WJXT Channel 4 that people from all across the country are congratulating him for trying to teach his son an important lesson. “Texas, Tennessee, just all over the place, telling me I’m not interested in your truck. I just want to tell you you’ve got Texas support and everyone supporting you with your decisions,” Gieger said. The annoyed father said he is selling the boy’s 1998 Ford Explorer because his recalcitrant son “thinks it’s cool to drive around with his friends smokin’ dope and acting all thug   …     especially not showing me and my wife the respect that we deserve. ” Gieger showed reporters the leavings of “a roach” he assumed his son and friends had smoked in the truck. “Got the last little bit of roach that I guess him and his buddies were smoking. Whoever gets this thing has definitely got to clean it out,” the father told the reporters.  Geiger also said he hoped to sell the truck to someone local so his son could see someone else driving it occasionally as a reminder of his lawless behavior. “I had it for $1, 500,” Geiger said, “and I’ll take $250 off if someone from the Westside did buy it, just so he could see it every now and then when he’s walking when he’s with his friends. ” The Florida father said he was shocked at all the attention his ad is getting but is happy his son is now buckling down and working on finishing high school so he can get his diploma.
