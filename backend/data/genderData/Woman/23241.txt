On Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Matt Boyle asked Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney what to expect from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s upcoming visit to Pearl Harbor. [Boyle noted that Japan still has not formally apologized for a “sneak attack that was completely unprovoked” against Pearl Harbor, and is not expected to do so during Abe’s visit, despite pressure for the U. S. to apologize for the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   “In that case, we actually saved millions of Japanese lives by ending the war sooner than it was going to end,” Boyle said of the nuclear bombings. “I think Prime Minister Abe is a pretty impressive fellow,” Gaffney responded. “I think he’s genuinely committed to the   alliance and to preventing the kinds of, well, possible future aggressions that I was just talking about, whether at the hands of the Chinese, the Russians, or both. I’ll be interested to see whether he decides to say something that conveys a note of regret about what happened. My gut tells me he probably will. ”  “There’s no question, in part at least, this visit at last is a response to President Obama’s trip to Hiroshima earlier this year,” he observed. “I was among those  —   I think perhaps you were, too  —   who frankly expected him to engage in an apology because Barack Obama has done that in most of the foreign places he’s gone, at one point or another, when he thinks the United States has erred. ”  “In this case, it’s pretty clear that the Japanese owe us one, and I think one may be forthcoming, in a manner that doesn’t lose them too much face,” Gaffney predicted.
