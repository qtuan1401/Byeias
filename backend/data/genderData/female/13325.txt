So why get mad at #SheaMoisture #blacktwitter,  —   Fuddge X (@FuddgeX) April 25, 2017,  Shea Moisture released a full apology following the backlash. “Wow, okay  —   so guys, listen, we really   this one up. Please know that our intention was not  —   and would never be  —   to disrespect our community,” reads the apology, “and as such, we are pulling this piece immediately because it does not represent what we intended to communicate. You guys know that we have always stood for inclusion in beauty and have always fought for our community and given them credit for not just building our business but for shifting the beauty landscape. ” “So, the feedback we are seeing here brings to light a very important point,” it continued. “While this campaign included several different videos showing different ethnicities and hair types to demonstrate the breadth and depth of each individual’s hair journey, we must absolutely ensure moving forward that our community is   in each one so that the women who have led this movement never feel that their hair journey is minimized in any way. ” “We are keenly aware of the journey that WOC face  —   and our work will continue to serve as the inspiration for work like the Perception Institute’s Good Hair   Association Test that suggests that a majority of people, regardless of race and gender, hold some bias towards women of color based on their textured or natural hair,” said the company. “So, you’re right. We are different  —   and we should know better. ” The apology ends stating, “Thank you all, as always, for the honest and candid feedback. We hear you. We’re listening. We appreciate you. We count on you. And we’re always here for you. Thank you, #SheaFam, for being there for us, even when we make mistakes.
