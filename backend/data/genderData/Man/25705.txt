According to a WLOS report, a North Carolina community is upset after being told to stop singing the National Anthem while on a visit to New York City.  Waynesville Middle School’s chorus was singing the anthem outside of the   Memorial while on a trip to New York when security asked them to stop midway through their performance. WLOS reports the   Memorial requires groups to obtain a permit if they want to perform. Although the students did not have a permit, they were given verbal permission from a security guard. Waynesville Middle School principal Trevor Putnam said, “Basically they performed approximately half of the National Anthem, and they were told by security to cease and desist. And they, of course, complied immediately. ” Per Putnam, security “explained to them that they treat that area as a burial site. ” He added, “I hate that our kids didn’t get to finish. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
