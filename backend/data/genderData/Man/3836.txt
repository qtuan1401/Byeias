Jack Sock was not going to be satisfied anymore with just making the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. In years past, he said, “I was happy to make the third and, you know, kind of whatever happens, happens. ” That nonchalance is perhaps befitting a    but not one who aspires to be a tennis champion. Sock has been a leader of the next generation of American men since winning the United States Open junior championship in 2010. He has been in the top 30 in singles most of the past year, but his greatest success has come in doubles, in which he has won two Grand Slam titles and two medals at the Rio Olympics. This summer, though, Sock decided to stop playing doubles regularly, splitting with his longtime partner Vasek Pospisil, with whom he won Wimbledon two years ago. “It was a tough decision on one end, but also an easy decision on the other, where you get all your energy and rest and hydration and you just take all the necessary steps to do your best in singles,” Sock said. “I think it’s showing. ” Sock claimed the biggest singles victory of his career Friday, upsetting   Marin Cilic,       to advance to the fourth round of the United States Open for the first time. “For me to make the second week here and every Slam going forward is my goal,” said Sock, who is seeded 26th. “I feel like if I’m playing good tennis and how I can, I feel like that’s kind of where I belong. ” Sock’s only other    appearance at a Grand Slam event was at the 2015 French Open, where he lost to Rafael Nadal in four sets. Nadal also advanced to the fourth round on Friday, with a       victory over Andrey Kuznetsov. In the fourth round Sunday, Sock will face     Tsonga, who defeated No. 23 Kevin Anderson,       (4). Cilic, the tournament’s 2014 champion, had won eight straight matches and ended Andy Murray’s   winning streak in the final of the Cincinnati event last week. Sock had beaten Cilic in their previous meeting, in July, overcoming a     deficit in a Davis Cup quarterfinal. Sock said the victory had been “the   of the summer for me. ” The Open has   Caroline Wozniacki’s year. A finalist here two years ago who is now ranked 74th, Wozniacki followed her upset of   Svetlana Kuznetsova with a     victory over Monica Niculescu. “It feels great to be back here,” said Wozniacki, who had not advanced past the third round of a tournament since February. “It feels like my back garden and everything feels so familiar. ” Anastasija Sevastova also backed up her upset of   Garbiñe Muguruza, topping Kateryna Bondarenko,     to reach the fourth round at a major for the first time since 2011. Ryan Harrison, the   American who beat   Milos Raonic on Wednesday, was not able to follow that upset with another victory. He lost,     (4)     to Marcos Baghdatis, who had not advanced to the fourth round of a major since the Australian Open in 2009.   Novak Djokovic is a regular in the round of 16 at majors, but he has never gotten there as easily as he has in this tournament. He has not played a full match since Monday night. Djokovic received a walkover in the second round because his opponent, Jiri Vesely, had a forearm injury. He got another break Friday when his   opponent, Mikhail Youzhny, retired with a left hamstring strain six games into their match. “This particular situation I never had in my Grand Slam career,” Djokovic said after practicing for an hour in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic, who is recovering from a wrist injury, said it was good to have some days off and shorter matches. But spending so little time on court is not ideal either. Djokovic has played only two full matches since winning the Rogers Cup in Toronto at the end of July and has just four and a half sets under his belt at the Open. “As you are approaching second week of the Grand Slam, you want to have match play and you want to have time spent on center court before you face one of the top players,” he said. Djokovic managed to avoid a top player in the next round, too. His opponent will be the Briton Kyle Edmund, ranked 84th in the world, who upended   John Isner,         (5). Edmund, 21, is enjoying the finest Grand Slam tournament of his young career. He had won only two matches in eight Grand Slam singles appearances coming into the Open, but he knocked out   Richard Gasquet in the first round before taking out Isner. Edmund broke Isner three times and piled up 43 winners. “I was pleased with my consistency throughout the match,” Edmund said. “There weren’t too many dips. And to do it on that stage, as well. Good crowd. Big court. Against John in his home country. ” He added, “These are the situations that you want to be in, that you dream about. ” Isner’s loss leaves Sock as the   American man, and Sock can make a run at being the top American in the rankings. Even with his renewed focus on singles, Sock gained something from his Olympic success in doubles: a new celebration dance. At the end of Friday’s match, Sock shuffled his feet and pretended his racket was a fencing foil. It was a nod to a friend he made in Rio, the American fencer Miles   who was at the match. Even in celebration, Sock was not settling for his current form. “If he’s in the box on the next one and I’m able to win,” Sock said, “you might see a   technique and a better version of it. ”
