 (CNN) Here’s a look at what you need to know about wildfires. Latest Wildfire Info:Here is the most recent ”National Significant Wildland Fire Potential Outlook” from the National Interagency Fire Center. About Wildfires:Wildfires are sometimes called ”wildland fires.” Wildfires can originate from a dropped match, cigarette embers, campfires, exhaust sparks from a train, or arson.  Many wildland fires are ignited by lightning. There are no official rules, but the first responders usually name a fire after a meadow, creek, city, or type of plant they see. Wind, temperature, and humidity all influence wildfires. Strong winds push flames toward new fuel sources. Wind can pick up and transfer burning embers and sparks, starting ”spot fires.” During the day, sunlight heats the ground and warm air rises, allowing hot air currents to travel up sloped landscapes. At night, the ground cools and air currents travel down the slopes.  Humidity dampens fuel, slowing the spread of flames. Humidity is greater at night, so fires usually burn less intensely then. Large fires can create their own winds and weather, increasing their flow of oxygen.  A really large fire can generate   winds, up to 120 mph. The high temperatures preheat fuels in the fire’s path, preparing them to burn more readily.
