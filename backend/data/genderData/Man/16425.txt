Former New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey warned against attending the 2016 Rio Olympics due to concerns about the Zika virus Sunday on New York AM 970 AM radio show “The Cats Roundtable. ”  “If you were going to design a method to take a very severe disease and spread it worldwide really quickly  …     you would hold an event at the epicenter of that disease, Brazil, and invite 500, 000 people to attend,” McCaughey told host John Catsimatidis. “I sympathize with the athletes who have trained and especially with the Brazilian economy, but the fact is this is going to spread this disease around the world. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
