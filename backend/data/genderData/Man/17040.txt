On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “MTP Daily,” National Journal Senior Political Columnist Ron Fournier stated that Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email conduct is something that, if everyone had done it, prevent the use of the Freedom of Information Act and legislative oversight, and “US secrets would be jeopardized. ”  Fournier said the FBI report “reaffirmed she’s not being very forthcoming. Again and again and again, she says, I can’t remember this, I can’t remember that, I can’t remember this, I can’t remember that. Well, come on. ” He added, “So, it’s more of the same. She did something that, from the beginning, that if everybody did it, we would not have FOI, we would not have Freedom of Information Act, we would not have legislative oversight, would not have historical record, US secrets would be jeopardized. And she hasn’t been very forthcoming, and in many cases, has flat out lied about why all this happened. So, this  —   you could say it’s baked in the cake. That doesn’t justify it, but it’s baked in the cake. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
