Did the Clinton Foundation influence the State Dept.? @chriscquinn weighs in https:  .  https:  .  On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “New Day,”   Chris Cuomo stated that the   emails relating to the Clinton Foundation show “coordination” between staffers at the State Department Clinton Foundation staffers, which is “wrong. ”  Cuomo said, “These 44 emails, you know, many of which show coordination between staffers of one and staffers of the other, it’s wrong. She said in 2009 she wouldn’t do it anymore, and it continued after that. ” Cuomo did concede CNN Political Commentator Christine Quinn’s point that Clinton wasn’t on the emails, but asked, “You don’t think that Hillary Clinton had any idea that the staffers  —   that Huma Abedin and other people were working with Doug Band at the foundation?” And asked Quinn, “So, you give her no responsibility for what the people underneath her do?” After Quinn stated that Cuomo couldn’t control what someone on his staff said in an email, he responded, “If they work for me, and it’s done as something that would be seen in the vein of what I want done, of course it’s going to come back to me. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
