As part of his talk at University   on race and the left, MILO said that former U. S president Lyndon B. Johnson was a “real racist. ”[  “Lyndon Baines Johnson or LBJ as he will always be known became president when Kennedy was murdered. His presidency spelled the beginning of tough times for black America. ” Criticising his escalation of the Vietnam War, MILO claimed that the creation of the welfare state as something that “installed blacks as an underclass. ” “He created the Great Society, which left him with a legacy as a civil rights champion.  That legacy is not deserved,” he said. He also claimed that Johnson was responsible for “creating a world for blacks where the Democrat party is their only choice. ” MILO also quoted the words of former Republican nominee Herman Cain, who described Democratic party as plantation, whilst voting republican meant leaving the plantation.   “LBJ was a real racist. I will leave it up to you to Google some of his quotes about black people,” he added. Written from prepared remarks.  Watch MILO’s full talk at UWM below.
