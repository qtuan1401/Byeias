Pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell discussed results from the latest Breitbart   poll on Thursday morning with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, saying, “In particular, I’m fascinated with this refugee question. We’re seeing great opposition even among large numbers of Democrats and Hillary voters against the refugee expansion, which the mainstream media basically doesn’t cover. ”[“It didn’t get a lot of play, or at least coherent play, in the debate,” continued Caddell. “That’s about sixty percent” opposed to the expansion of the program.  Caddell also pointed out that about seventy percent of those polled opposed the United States “relinquishing its management” role with the Internet, seeing it as “a really bad idea. ” About half of respondents saw it as “another sign of American weakness. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
