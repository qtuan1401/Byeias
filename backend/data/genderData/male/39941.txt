In August, the RNC announced that Cleveland would host the 2016 Republican National Convention. Mitt Romney to speak at RNC meeting, Moving the convention to July is just one of several moves by Priebus to try and put the GOP nominee in the strongest possible position heading into the 2016 general election.

And Priebus is also working to limit the number of primary debates and is condensing the primary calendar to avoid a long, drawn out battle for the GOP nomination.
