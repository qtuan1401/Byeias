Drivers on New Year’s Eve were stuck for several hours in both directions on   north of Los Angeles, thanks to snow that fell in the area. [The road, known as the “grapevine,” snakes through the mountains between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. The thoroughfare was closed early on Saturday evening, and only   about 90 minutes before midnight, according to   the local CBS News affiliate in the Bay Area.  GRAPEVINE: Route has   with CHP escorting traffic. Drive with care and patience. Happy New Year!  —   Caltrans District 6 (@caltransdist6) January 1, 2017,  The entire state has been hit by rain and snow over the past several weeks, as winter storms have arrived somewhat unexpectedly. Forecasters had predicted a dry winter, thanks to the condition known as La Niña, which typically follows an El Niño pattern. Last year’s El Niño brought rain to Northern California but left Southern California dry. This year’s storms have already drenched Southern California  —   and have brought snow to the surrounding mountains as well. That has residents hopeful that a   drought may finally be broken. Drivers, however, were less happy. “It’s terrible nobody here knows how to drive in snow,” one driver from Washington told CBS Los Angeles. Small amounts of snowfall  —   such as the    inches forecast for the area  —   that would not stop traffic in other parts of the country often bring driving to a standstill in California, where public authorities lack snow plows and drivers do not typically use snow tires or carry snow chains. Saturday also saw a   pileup near Bakersfield in a crash that left at least two drivers dead, according to San Diego’s 10 News. The accident was apparently unrelated to the weather conditions.
