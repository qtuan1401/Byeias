A billboard in St. Augustine, FL is bothering passersby so much that there is now a petition for its removal, per a report by First Coast News.  The billboard reads “Islam Bloody Islam Doomed by Its Doctrine!” and the petition to remove it has already gained over 2, 000 signatures. The petition was created by local resident Becky Williams, who wrote: “We should always stand up for those in our community who are shown hatred and intolerance. We should be outraged that a billboard with this message could in any way represent our community as a whole. It is of the utmost importance that we stand against messages and movements that isolate, judge and threaten an entire sect of people who share our same hometown. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
