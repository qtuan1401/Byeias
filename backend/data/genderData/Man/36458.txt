 (CNN) Pop star Rihanna will be bringing her acting talents to the small screen when she takes on a key role in the final season of ”Bates Motel.” Her casting was revealed Friday at the   International convention in San Diego, where the cast and crew of the show held a panel discussion.  The show’s official Twitter account tweeted a video of the singer announcing the role. ”I am about to check into the Bates Motel very soon,” she said. ”Guess what else? Guess who’s playing Marion?” ”Bates Motel” is a prequel to the classic 1960 horror film ”Psycho,” directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In the movie, Marion Crane    played by the late actress Janet Leigh    meets her death in a bloody shower scene.   The TV series, which airs on the cable network AE, explores the relationship between Norman Bates and his mother Norma, who run the motel in the remote seaside town of White Pine Bay, Oregon. While Rihanna is best known for hit songs including ”Work,” ”Umbrella” and ”What’s My Name,” the    Barbadian also has a number of acting gigs under her belt, having appeared in films such as ”Battleship” and ”This is the End.” Her role in the fifth and final season of ”Bates Motel” will see her star alongside Vera Farmiga, Freddie Highmore, Max Thieriot, Olivia Cooke and Nestor Carbonell.
