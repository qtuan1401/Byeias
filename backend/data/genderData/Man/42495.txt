 (CNN) France stepped up its Women’s World Cup challenge with a   dismissal of South Korea in a last 16 match Sunday while fancied Brazil made a shock exit to Australia. Les Bleues played with flair and invention to outclass the Koreans with   Delie putting them ahead as early as the fourth minute after a fine passing move. France added to the advantage in the eighth minute with Elodie Thomis jinking through the Korean defense to fire home. A further strike from Delie just after the break ensured victory for the French and a heavyweight quarterfinal tie against Germany. Earlier, there was a major upset as Marta’s Brazil tripped up against Australia in a windy Moncton Stadium in New Brunswick. The former   world player of the year had good chances to add to her record tally of 15 World Cup goals and Brazil was made to pay for the missed opportunities. With 80 minutes on the clock Australia captain Lisa De Vanna saw her shot saved by Brazil goalkeeper Luciana and substitute Kyah Simon scored off the rebound. It was her third goal of the tournament to earn her side a quarterfinal tie against either reigning champion Japan or the Netherlands. But for Brazil bitter disappointment against a side which had never won a knockout match at a Women’s World Cup.
