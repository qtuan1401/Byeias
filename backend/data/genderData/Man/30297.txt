A    man was shot and killed at a   in Reno, Nevada on Thursday evening in an apparent dispute over a parking spot. [Local ABC News affiliate KOLO 8 reports:  What started as a road rage incident at the East Second Street Walmart in Reno Thanksgiving evening turned into a fatality, Reno Police Department, Lt. Scott Shaw said.   …     The incident started about 6:05 p. m. at the Walmart at 2425 E 2nd St. Shaw said. There was apparently a dispute over a parking spot. The homicide happened in the driveway leaving the Walmart going to East Second Street. Several agencies responded and the westbound lane East Second Street will remain closed until late Thanksgiving night for the investigation. The Associated Press adds: Police in Reno say the argument began shortly after 6 p. m. Thursday. They say two vehicles stopped near the exit of the lot. They say both persons involved were armed with weapons and a    man was shot dead at the scene. Investigators say no arrests have been made, but those involved in the shooting have been located. The vehicles and gun have also been recovered. The Reno incident was one of several violent episodes across the country, as shoppers jostled for discount goods. Past violence and crowding has encouraged many consumers to stay home on Black Friday. Many are choosing to shop online instead, either on “Cyber Monday”  —   the Monday following Thanksgiving  —   or throughout the holiday period. Protests, which have also been a feature of Black Friday in previous years, seem to be more subdued this year. The Chicago   reports that this year’s protest is smaller than last year’s protest, which virtually shut down Michigan Avenue’s “Magnificent Mile” of   retail stores. Photo: File, Joel B.
