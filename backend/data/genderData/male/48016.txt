’   Katie Ledecky, the    American swimming prodigy, made a   statement Sunday night in her first individual race at the Rio   Olympics, winning gold and breaking her own world record in the     freestyle. ’ ’   Ledecky broke the record by two seconds and beat the     finisher by nearly five seconds. ’ ’   Plenty of  whether it was   her swimming in entirely open water or her leading comfortably   ahead of the   mark. ’ ’   But the most illustrative example of her victory may have come at   the end, when she was celebrating her world record and gold medal   while other swimmers finished. ’ ’  ’ ”   Here’s another angle, in which Ledecky is celebrating while   another swimmer touches the wall. ” ’  ’ ” Ledecky’s margin of victory was greater   than the margin of victory over the past six women’s 400m Olympic   races combined.” ’   The scariest thought: Ledecky is still yet to swim in her best   event, the   freestyle. ’
