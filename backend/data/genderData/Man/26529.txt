Was that a     double play?! @SportsCenter #SCtop10 pic. twitter.  Thursday, Cincinnati Reds class A team Dayton Dragons made one of the craziest plays you may see in baseball.  South Bend Cubs infielder P. J. Higgins hit a line drive up the middle that bounced off Dragons pitcher Alex Webb and hit the umpire. The ball then rolled over to shortstop Luis Gonzalez, who was able to step on second base and fire the ball over to first to get Higgins for the second out. For those scoring at home, it would be a     double play. Although the ball did not roll in the Cubsâ€™ favor on this play, they did go on to defeat the Dragons  .
