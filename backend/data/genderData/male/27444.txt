During a portion of her interview with Oprah Winfrey set to air on CBS on Monday night, First Lady Michelle Obama said, “Color, wealth, these things that don’t matter, still play too much of a role in how we see each other. ”  During a discussion on being labeled an “angry black woman” Obama stated that her initial reaction was, “Dang, you don’t even know me.   …     Where’d that come from?” And “That is so not me. ” Obama continued that after that reaction, “you sort of think, ‘Well, this isn’t about me. This is about the person or the people who write it. ’” She further stated, “And then you start thinking, ‘Oh wow, we’re so afraid of each other.’ Color, wealth, these things that don’t matter, still play too much of a role in how we see each other. ” Obama concluded that someone’s values are what really matters, and that she decided, “let me live my life out loud, so that people can then see, and then judge for themselves, and that’s what I want young people to do. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
