Witnesses said that the terrorists were young men, in their thirties, and a military official said that the gunmen “forced their victims to scream ‘Allahu Akbar’ before shooting them” while they themselves did the same. During their rampage, the gunmen killed at least 14 civilians and two members of special forces, leaving the beach littered with bloody corpses before they could be taken away by security forces and Ivorian Red Cross workers. One tourist was reportedly trying to make a call on his cell phone when one of the assailants came up from behind him and shot him in the head, while simultaneously yelling “Allahu akbar. ” The men were reportedly heavily armed with different sorts of weaponry. One witness, a Lebanese national who was staying at the Étoile du Sud Hotel, said that one of the attackers was carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle and wore a grenade belt.
