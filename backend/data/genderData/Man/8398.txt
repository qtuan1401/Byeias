According to Proceso, earlier in the day, gunmen torched multiple bars and a home in Ixtapa, another of Guerrero’s famed tourists’ destinations. The raging violence in Guerrero comes after government officials stepped up their military and police in preparation for Easter Week festivities. In Mexico, students do not get a Spring Break however, most schools and businesses closed for the religious holiday of Easter. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting,  the once quiet resort town of Acapulco became a hotbed of cartel violence as numerous Mexican cartels continue to fight over control of the Mexican state of Guerrero. The state provides cartels with rural areas for the production of poppy plants, access to Acapulco’s shipping port, a tourist hub with local drug demand, as well as trade routes to Mexico City and other top trafficking destinations.
