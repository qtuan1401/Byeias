On Thursday’s “First Take” on ESPN2, ESPN’s Marly Rivera responded to former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz comments at the Republican National Convention where he called the high number of immigrants an “invasion” and said immigrants should learn and speak English.  According to Rivera, immigrants have their own cultures and Holtz has to respect them. She said, “I have an accent. My first language is Spanish. I try, I am trying to help your culture, but I still have my culture. You have to respect it. I am not going to give up everything that makes me me just because you don’t like it. That’s the only reason. It’s not like I’m not enriching America, it’s not that I’m not a contributing member of society, it’s not because I haven’t spoken English, it’s because you don’t like me being here. That’s the bottom line. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
