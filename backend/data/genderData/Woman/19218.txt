A 15 year old girl has committed suicide after supposed “friends” shared nude footage of her on Snapchat. [The video in question captured Tovonna Teamer taking a shared shower and was posted to Snapchat. A few hours later, Tovonna’s mother found her daughter dying in their bathroom. Despite attempts to staunch the flow of blood from Tovonna’s   gunshot wound to the head, it was too late.  Tovonna’s aunt says, “Everybody was out there talking about her and calling her names, and they said it went up on social media, whatever, Snapchat. I’d never heard of it before. ” Unfortunately, the damage was done before her family was even aware of the issue. Now Levon Teamer seeks justice for the horrific tragedy and the bullying that allegedly cost her daughter’s life. The Pasco Sherriff’s Office has stated that they are investigating the matter, but for Tovanna and her surviving family, it’s already too late.
