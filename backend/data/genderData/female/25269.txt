On Friday, talk radio host Rush Limbaugh argued Black Lives Matter is “a terrorist group. They’re quickly becoming a terrorist group committing hate crimes. ”  Limbaugh said, “Speaking of President Obama, in part of show prep today, I found a story from March, I think, of 2015, in which, President Obama welcomed two founders of Black Lives Matter to the White House and commemorated them and their efforts, and praised them as being better organizers than he is. And that’s the  —   Black Lives Matter was just exactly who they are then as who they are today. They’re a terrorist group. They’re quickly becoming a terrorist group committing hate crimes. And the attorney general today is saying that she’s going to look into this, investigate this as a hate crime, which is amazing they’re not trying to find out if this guy is a member of the Tea Party. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
