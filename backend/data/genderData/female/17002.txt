Black Lives Matter and the Students for Democratic Society banded together today at Florida State University to protest MILO’s talk on campus.[  “Racist, sexist,  . Milo Milo, Go away!” the crowd chanted. The line of Milo fans awaiting entry into the lecture hall chanted back “Build the Wall. ” One Milo fan held up his own placard alongside those of the   protesters.  The protest was led by a number of characters, including a hairy   male wearing a tight dress, an overweight woman with a striking purple mohawk.  The speakers accused Breitbart News of being a “  organization” supporting MILO and the “hate speech” he uses.  The   rally concluded just before he took the stage, with protesters retiring to a separate venue for a meeting.  You can watch Milo’s full talk at FSU below.
