HBO’s “Real Time” host Bill Maher criticized liberals “who don’t know sh*t about guns” for speaking about gun control and criticized recent gun control pushes as “a little bit elitist and a little bit racist,” on Friday.  Maher said, “[D]oes it really matter if we are banning certain guns? Because, I see that the liberals, they talk about guns  —   now, I’m not a gun expert, but I see a lot of people talking about guns who don’t know sh*t about guns. I know a little about  —   it’s like when the pope talks about vaginas, you know. And that’s when the conservatives stop listening. Like, I know a lot of them think that  . ‘AR’ stands for ‘assault rifle.’ It doesn’t. and it’s not an assault rifle. It’s not an automatic weapon. Those are illegal. There are a lot of weapons they’re not even talking about banning that basically do the same thing as an   because you have to squeeze each round. ” Maher added, “[T]he Washington Post says in 2015, 39 deaths from mass shootings. Now, of course, we should say, any death is too many, blah, blah, blah. But, let’s get real. A lot of this is a little bit elitist and a little bit racist, like you were starting to say. It’s like when shootings happen to white people in nice places. ” Maher later said that there is gun control legislation he supports, and that he stops listening, “When it starts with the democrats with, ‘Well, I’m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. ’” And agreed the “glorification” of guns should be taken out of the American psyche.
