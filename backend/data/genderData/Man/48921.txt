’  ’ ’   The tide is going out on active managers. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’pose an existential threat to   the   funds industry. ’ ’   These funds have suffered from poor performance of late, helping   speed the shift from actively managed funds to the low cost, tax   efficient passive alternatives.  ’ ”   And according to a   study Deutsche Bank released   this past week, there really isn’t much active funds can do   to stem the flow of assets. All they can do is slow the   shift.  ” ’   The note said:  ’ ’   The equilibrium Deutsche Bank is referring to is the breakdown of   assets between active funds and passive funds. Right now, more   money is managed in active funds. That could soon change. ’ ”   Here is a roundup of Deutsche Bank’s major   points.  ” ”   Hybrid and fixed income strategies face a similar hurdle. Even if   active investment performance improves, passive’s share will rise   from 30% today to about 40% in five years  —   or 50% if it doesn’t,   the report said. ” ’  ’ ”   Still, Deutsche Bank isn’t worried about an   impending death of active management. Nearly 40% of the   industry’s assets are in active strategies in which managers are   providing superior   returns compared to their passive   cousins, the report said. ” ’   Some of the active firms set for higher growth include   Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price and JPMorgan, according to   Deustche. ’ ”   What’s more likely in the long term is that investors will   increasingly adopt a mix of active and passive strategies, the   report said. ”
