’Bots are hot in Silicon Valley. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ”Evernote founder and partner at VC firm General Catalyst, Phil Libin, believes that bots are the  and that they’ll rewrite the tech space like apps did in 2008.” ’Libin, who leads incubator within the firm to experiment and build bot companies and has already announced his first investment  —   a   —   says that everything he’’s seen has taught him that the ”first law of chatbots’’ ought to be that they shouldn’’t try to deceive you into thinking you’’re talking to a real person. If they do, people will just end up disappointed.’ ’In Star Wars terms, bots should be more like ’ ’’ ’’ ’”A bot that pretends to have   natural language processing and AI capability raises the user’s expectations, which inevitably leads to disappointment,” he says. ”A bot that sets clear expectations about its capabilities (and limitations) will have a better shot at engaging and delighting the customer.” ’ ’That underscores another problem right now: Most  Or, as Libin puts it, we’’re still stuck in the ”fart and flashlight” era of usefulness.  ’ ’So, bots need to make it clear what their limits are and try to help people get as much use out of them as possible. In other words, they should be guides not butlers. ’ ’ ”’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’Although chatbots are ”very weak” right now, Mikhail Naumov, president of the bot company Digital Genius, says that with time they’’ll grow up and be able to learn more quickly and deeply.’ ’”I think right now we are in the ’’Valley of Disillusionment’’ part of the hype cycle,” Libin agrees. ”The early stuff was all trivial and disappointing, so the people who were chasing trends are now skeptical. While people who are serious haven’’t even begun to deliver what they’’re working on.  I think the people who are serious about them, it’’s going to take another several months for even the early work to start coming out. It’’s an exciting time. ”’ ’Bots are hot in Silicon Valley. ..’
