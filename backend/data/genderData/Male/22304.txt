Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton assures MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski that there are no embarrassing emails that exist surrounding her work and the State Department and donations to the Clinton Foundation. [“Are you certain that there are no emails or foundation ties to foreign entities that will be revealed that could perhaps permanently impact your presidential prospects?” asked Brzezinski.  “I am sure,” Clinton replied. Nearly 15, 000 of Clinton’s deleted emails have been recovered by the FBI, nearly 50 percent more than she provided to the State Department from her private   server. Those   have yet to be released to the public, prompting election observers to question whether content in those   might hurt her presidential prospects. Clinton added that she went “above and beyond” the law by disclosing donors to the foundation voluntarily. But not all of them. “My work is not influenced by outside sources,” she insisted. “I made policy decisions to keep Americans safe. I believe my aides also acted appropriate appropriately. ” They didn’t.
