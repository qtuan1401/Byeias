Thursday at Georgetown Law School, Vice President Joe Biden said Republican senators blocking a vote on Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nomination to the Supreme Court to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, “can lead to a genuine constitutional crisis. ”  Biden added Republicans are “quoting selectively” from his Senate floor in 1992 when he argued against Supreme Court nominations until “after the political campaign season is over,” saying the “Biden Rule,” doesn’t exist. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) has referenced Biden’s 1992 speech dubbing it the “Biden rule” when making an argument for not moving froward with hearings for Garland.
