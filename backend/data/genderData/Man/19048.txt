President Obama spoke to reporters Monday about the terrorist attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and said Omar Mateen had a “Glock which had a lot of clips in it. ”[Obama also said Mateen had an “assault rifle. ”  According to CNN, the President explained that Mateen acquired his guns via a background check. And he explained that the background check did not stop Manteen “because he did not have a criminal record that in some ways would prohibit him from purchasing” his weapons. Breitbart News has previously warned readers not to be fooled into believing background checks will prevent   attackers from striking, and Obama’s admission is confirmation that background checks did not hinder Mateen in the least. Background checks only stop actual criminals, not latent ones. Obama continued by expressing surprise that Mateen was able “to just carry [his  ] out of the store” after passing a background check. Yet the federal background check law, which took effect in 1998, is called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). It is called “instant” because one takes possession of his gun immediately, barring any criminal record or state law delaying or prohibiting the purchase. Nevertheless, Obama suggested Mateen’s passage of a background check and a consequent ability to carry a gun out the store demonstrate “the degree to which it was not difficult for him to obtain these kinds of weapons. ” It should be noted that Glocks do not have “clips” they have magazines.
