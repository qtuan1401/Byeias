Thirty dogs raised to be slaughtered and served for dinner were recently rescued from a “South Korean meat farm” and flown to San Diego as part of a program overseen by the Humane Society International. [The dogs range in age “from 6 months to 2 years old and include golden retrievers, huskies and Korean mastiffs. ”  According to the Los Angeles Times, the Humane Society claims the dogs were kept in cages and “subjected to daily cruelty and had very little food or veterinary care. ” San Diego Humane Society spokeswoman Stacy Archambault said Humane Society personnel picked up the dogs and flew them to San Diego where they are received care they lacked in South Korea. She observed, “Many were afraid and were being given time to adjust to their new surroundings. ” Gary Weitzman is also with the San Diego Humane Society. He said, “Helping to end the horrors of the   trade is a critical mission for us. ” Weitzman added, “We have pledged to keep San Diego at zero euthanasia of healthy and treatable animals  —   and we will keep that promise  —   but that doesn’t mean we will ever turn our backs on other animals in need. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
