In a continuation of social media’s censorship trend, conservative comedy group “Toughen Up America,” had their Instagram profile suspended from the platform this weekend without reason. [Toughen Up America, which has several thousand followers across a number of social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, uses comedy to address political topics like the upcoming election, illegal immigration, and why they believe that “liberalism is a mental disease. ”  The suspension came on the same day as Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos’   suspension from Twitter which occurred after he took to the platform with criticisms of Islam. It also comes after multiple questionable suspension of Islam critics from Facebook, which owns Instagram. In an email to Breitbart, Toughen Up told us that Instagram suspended them without warning, and didn’t give them a chance to appeal the suspension, which appears to be permanent. “Instagram gave us no notifications and no chance to appeal. Our account has been censored because we were really starting to reach   Americans using comedy memes. We started another account and they have temporarily suspended that as well. ” It’s unclear as to what triggered Instagram’s decision to remove Toughen Up America from their platform, but we will continue to update this article with any new information as it becomes available. We have reached out to Instagram for comment. Tom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart. You can follow him on Twitter @tciccotta or on Facebook.
