A reporter attempting to capture footage of Milo Yiannopoulos’ event that was cut short at DePaul University in Chicago was arrested and jailed for the night after refusing to stop filming. [Jeremy Segal, a filmmaker, former Breitbart contributor, and founder of the video news site Rebel Pundit, was attempting to film the event which he described as an important opportunity to get footage for his film.   “As I was following the protests, I was followed by an administrator who was trying to get campus security to make me leave. They wouldn’t allow me to enter the room where the event was happening,” he told Breitbart News.  The attempt to remove him came despite the fact that he had   with the event organisers permission to attend and openly film.  “I was assured by the President of Media Relations at the university that the College Republicans reserved the right of permission for me to film within their event, which they granted,” he added. When Segal refused to stop filming, the university administrator called the police. He was consequently arrested and charged with criminal trespass. “I was booked, fingerprinted, processed and then locked up for 8 hours in a 4 wall concrete cell. I was given two bologna sandwiches to eat,” he added. However on his Twitter feed, Segal confirmed that he got some “insane footage” of a “rabid, fascist mob of special snowflakes,” that will be uploaded shortly.
