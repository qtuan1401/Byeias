Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” House Homeland Security Chair Rep. Michael McCaul ( ) said that ISIS was not on the run as some have claimed, but instead, “It is on the rise. ”  Commenting on President Barack Obama’s speech yesterday, McCaul said, “Well he says it is not a military strategy to say radical Islam. The fact is, he hasn’t had a military strategy for the last three years, since we have been briefed about ISIS. And ISIS is not on the run, it is on the rise. I was over in in Sinai, Egypt, were they are growing  —   in Tunisia, Libya. We are making some gains in Iraq and Syria. But it is long overdue to take military action there. I  saw the F18’s going in to Iraq and Syria to bomb ISIS. But it has taken him three years to get to this point. You have to define the enemy to defeat it. That is a military strategist axiom. Churchill didn’t dance around the Nazis, he called it fascism. President Reagan and Kennedy called it communism and they defeated communism. Now we have a generational threat, a struggle called Islamist extremism. We need to define it to defeat it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
