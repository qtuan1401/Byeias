’  ’ ’   Most of us ask one   question when we exchange pleasantries   with friends, coworkers, and peers: ’ ’   ”How are you?” ’ ’   The question may seem harmless, but it tends to lead to one   socially acceptable answer: ’ ’   ”I’’m fine.” ’ ’   The problem is that ”I’’m fine” often is not the truth. And if you   ask this question of someone who is dealing with a lot in their   personal life, it may come across as insensitive. ’ ’   Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg often felt this   way when friends would ask her ”How are you?” after the sudden   death of her husband, Dave Goldberg, in 2015. ’ ’   ”After my husband died, I found the standard American greeting of   ’’How are you? ’’ to be a really hard question to answer,”  in an interview about her new   book about grief, ”.” ’ ’   ”The response to the standard American greeting of ’’How are you? ’’   is ’’I’’m great,’’ and anything else is jarring,” she said. ”When   people are really suffering and we know they’’re suffering, that   question can be a very difficult one. Inadvertently, I think   without anyone meaning it, it communicates a lack of empathy.” ’ ’   Instead, Sandberg recommends adjusting the question slightly:   ”How are you today?” ’ ’   She says the slightly altered question implies: ”I get it. You   are going through something hard, and you are living day to day.” ’ ’   ”And it’’s a much kinder question,” she said. ’ ’   She says everyone grieves differently and that she often made the   mistake of asking ”How are you?” before her husband’’s death. ’ ’   Listen to the full interview with Sandberg on Business Insider’’s   podcast, ”,” below, or . ’ ’ ’ ’Most of us ask one   question when we. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
