During CNN’s Election Night coverage anchor Jake Tapper argued that “We’ve been talking  …    about what’s going to happen to the Republican Party, and the bloodletting, and the infighting, and who’s going to lead the Republican Party and all that. Again, completely wrong, it’s the Democratic Party that’s going to have this fight. ”  Tapper said, “And in fact, in the exit polls I saw earlier, I don’t know if they’ve been updated, the Democrats were losing half of union households. We’ve been talking because we’ve been all trusting the polls  …    about what’s going to happen to the Republican Party, and the bloodletting, and the infighting, and who’s going to lead the Republican Party and all that. Again, completely wrong, it’s the Democratic Party that’s going to have this fight. ” He added, “[T]he performance of Democrats, as of right now, in these Rust Belt states has been so challenged, shall we say, I think it’s fair to say that the [Sen.] Bernie Sanders ( ) [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren ( ) wing of the Democratic Party is going to be emboldened and stronger, and Democrats are going to be saying, what went wrong, even if Hillary Clinton wins tonight, which seems less probable by the hour, even if she wins there is going to be a real argument Democrats have ignored working class  —   white working class voters for too long. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
