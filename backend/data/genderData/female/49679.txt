’  ’ ’   WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Thursday blasted US   media outlets, contending in an interview that the power   possessed by journalists had greatly diminished in recent years. ’ ’   ”They’re increasingly not very important,” Assange said in a   radio interview with Sean Hannity. ’ ’   The Fox News host agreed: ”So true.” ’ ’   Assange characterized the press as a ”paper tiger” in the 2016   election and said the rise of new media had eroded the influence   of traditional outlets. ’ ’   ”The old press is less important,” he said. ’ ’’ ’   Assange took particular issue with the ”liberal press,” blaming   such journalists for a ”degree of bias” that chased away readers. ’ ’   ”Readers see that. They feel it,” he said. ”They don’t like being   lectured or told what to do. And they rebel against it.” ’ ’   Assange is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to evade   questioning over a   allegation in Sweden. WikiLeaks   released thousands of hacked emails from top Democratic officials   throughout the campaign. ’ ’   US national security officials believe the hacking of such   officials was  by Russia, and officials in   recent days have pointed to Russian President Vladimir Putin   being directly involved in the operation. ’
