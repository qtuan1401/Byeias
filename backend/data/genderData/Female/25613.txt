ABC7 reports that a group of Chicago area high school students were taught Saturday how to be ready for life after school in the working world.  Three hundred graduating seniors from the area were all fitted for suits donated by local businessmen as part of the first “Project Gentlemen,” which is an   event to prepare young men for the real world. Founder of Project Gentlemen, Jermaine Lawrence Anderson, told reporters, “We tell the young men it’s not about the outer garments you wear, but we do want to take pride in your appearance. Because that appearance can get you in doors and also get doors closed in your face. ” This weekend’s event featured a a motivational speech delivered by the vice president of Walgreens. On top of the new suits, the young men were given career advice and lessons on grooming and proper etiquette. This is similar to another report out of South Carolina where an elementary school teacher taught students how to dress and act like gentlemen. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
