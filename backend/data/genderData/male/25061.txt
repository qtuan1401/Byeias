Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough hammered Sen. Ted Cruz’s ( ) presidential campaign for its decision to fire spokesman Rick Tyler yesterday after he had posted a video on social media that falsely depicted Marco Rubio dismissing the Bible.  According to Scarborough, what Tyler did was a bad thing, but he questioned whether or it was worthy of a firing. “It seems to me that if Jesus died for our sins, then Rick Tyler died for the sins of many in the Cruz campaign,” Scarborough said. “He was thrown overboard for retweeting something, which he then took down, which he then apologized for. And yet, then Ted Cruz threw him under the bus, a guy that has been respected and a guy that was the heart of this campaign for a very long time. It seems like a sacrificial lamb at the very least. ” “I love a lot of things about politics,” Scarborough later said. “I love when John Kasich gets a guy and cries. I love seeing Jeb Bush show grace under pressure when he’s getting out of the race. I hate when a politician throws a staff member under the bus and fires him to get a little bit of heat off him for the day when this entire campaign lied in   on Twitter as the Iowa caucuses were closing. They Photoshopped ads. They did so many other things that were far worse. I’m not saying what Rick did wasn’t bad, but so many things were more calculated, more thought out. ” Scarborough went on to add the firing says a lot more about the Cruz campaign than Tyler. @rickwtyler paid for the political sins of many. The way he was fired for convenience says more about the campaign than the man.  —   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 23, 2016,  “I was going to say and I actually tweeted it this morning at 5:00  —   Rick’s firing, a guy I don’t know  —   Rick’s firing says a lot more about the campaign than it says about Rick,” Scarborough added.
