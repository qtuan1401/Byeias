Washington (CNN) Vice President Joe Biden on Monday officiated his first wedding ever, for two longtime White House staffers. Posting a photo of the ceremony on Twitter, Biden wrote, ”Proud to marry Brian and Joe at my house. Couldn’t be happier, two longtime White House staffers, two great guys.” His office said the vice president obtained a temporary certification from the District of Columbia to preside over the wedding ceremony, which was attended only by the grooms’ families. It took place in the living room of his home at the U. S. Naval Observatory in Washington. The newlyweds are Brian Mosteller, director of Oval Office operations for President Barack Obama, and Joe Mahshie, a trip coordinator for first lady Michelle Obama. Biden’s wife, Jill, later tweeted: ”Love is love!” The Naval Observatory has hosted wedding receptions before. Vice President Al Gore’s daughter celebrated her marriage in 1997 at the official vice presidential residence, though the ceremony itself took place at the National Cathedral, a   drive up Massachusetts Avenue. That was a larger affair, with an air conditioned tent erected on Gore’s lawn and Aretha Franklin performing for the guests.
