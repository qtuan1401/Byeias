Hurricane Matthew left a tableau of devastation across southern Haiti, destroying houses, leaving villages under several feet of water and killing more than 800 people, according to a count by Reuters. Photographers captured disturbing images of the aftermath. Many of the   areas in the south were completely cut off from rescue workers by severed phone lines and collapsed bridges until Thursday. Men in   searched for a place to cross La Digue river after the only bridge linking to the south collapsed. Buildings were ravaged, including the Ste.  church in Les Cayes, below. “That many people died because they never believed what the authorities told them when they said they had to evacuate,” said Jean Senozier Despreux, who lives and works in Les Cayes and weathered the storm there. “They resisted it. ” Mr. Despreux said the death toll was not surprising. “We knew we would continue find people under the rubble,” he said. “It was so intense there was no way out. ” In Jérémie, burials had already begun on Thursday. In Les Cayes, across the peninsula from Jérémie, people lost their homes, livestock and possessions. A street vendor, below, sold food on the side of a road after the storm. At least 20, 000 homes were damaged across the country, officials said.
