Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Democrats are more likely to engage in voter fraud than Republicans.  Giuliani said “Dead people generally vote for Democrats rather than Republicans. ” He added, “I’ve found very few situations where Republicans cheat. They don’t control the inner cities the way Democrats do. Maybe if Republicans controlled the inner cities, they’d do as much cheating as Democrats. ” (  Politico) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
