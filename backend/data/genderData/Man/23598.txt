On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,”   Mika Brzezinski argued that Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State set up her private email server for a “  reason” “And it was done, whether it’s to widen the footprint of the foundation while she was secretary of state, or, whatever, paranoia, but, they set up a server, because they didn’t want it in the State Department. ”  Brzezinski said, during a discussion of Clinton’s answers about her email, “I think there’s a bigger problem.   …     What really worried me is that there’s a bigger picture here, that they are, I don’t want to say covering up, because it sounds like completely illegal, I think there was just a   reason to set up the own  —   the private server, that was completely inappropriate. And it was done, whether it’s to widen the footprint of the foundation while she was secretary of state, or, whatever, paranoia, but, they set up a server, because they didn’t want it in the State Department. Can we go back to the beginning here and not talk about the five emails that weren’t marked or were marked, and whether or not she knew they were marked. It was wrong. All of it. ” Later in the segment Brzezinski stated that FBI Director James Comey gave Clinton “a huge break. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
