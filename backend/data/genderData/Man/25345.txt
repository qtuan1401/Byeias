Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” journalist Glenn Greenwald said the WikiLeaks emails from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s staff shows a pattern of “serious impropriety” of media collusion with the Clinton campaign.  When asked if the leaks show journalist impropriety, Greenwald said, “Some of them are standard, normal standard back and forth jockeying between campaigns and journalists, others though are I think are examples of serious impropriety. I think Donna Brazile leaking  —   getting a hols of a town hall question and only giving it to the Clinton campaign and not the Sanders campaign is an example of cheating. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
