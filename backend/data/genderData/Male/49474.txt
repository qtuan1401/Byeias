’  ’ ”   Virtual reality is most closely associated with video games.   That’s with good reason: The major headsets from Facebook (Oculus   Rift) HTC (Vive) and Sony (PlayStation VR) are primarily   intended for use with video games. ” ’  ’ ’   But VR is being used for much more, from  to  to understanding  —   and potentially   treating  —   pedophiles. ’ ’   In  host Ben Johnson   speaks with Dr. Patrice Renaud, a psychologist at the Philippe   Penel Institute in Montreal, Canada. Dr. Renaud and his team are   using VR ”to try and identify which patients might endanger   children in the outside world, and essentially keep them off the   street,” says Johnson. ’ ’   Patients are asked to put on a VR headset, and they are presented   with an animated VR experience. ’ ’ ’ ’   ”What we develop is, strictly speaking, child pornography,” says   Renaud. ”But we have a license to do that. So of course it’’s   strictly prohibited to use that in other contexts.” ’ ”   The patient’s arousal is measured, and the results are   tracked; the procedure is intended as an assessment of the   individual’s ability to suppress pedophilic urges. ” ’   ”The tricky part of using interactive virtual reality to treat   sex offenders is to make sure the guy won’’t leave the lab with   more fantasies than he had previously,” says Renaud. ”That’’s why   we want to start with individuals who are incarcerated or   hospitalized.”  ’ ’   It may even be used to treat pedophilia some day,   as a means of educating patients on the cues associated with   dangerous behavior. ”We can use virtual environments, for   instance, to help individuals to recognize cues in the   environment that would be problematic,” says Renaud.  ’ ’ Check out the full episode right here: ’ ’ ’
