In an interview published February 14, Eagles of Death Metal lead singer Jesse Hughes said the November 13 Paris terror attacks have him carrying a gun everywhere he goes in the U. S.[During the attacks, terrorists killed a total of 130 innocents  —   the great majority of which were fans gathered for an Eagles of Death Metal concert in the Bataclan.  According to AFP, Hughes said he is fortunate to have emerged from the attack without “hating,” and he credited fans with being his “therapy. ” Yet it was clear the attack changed him. Hughes said, “I don’t go anywhere in America without a gun anymore. That sucks. And I’m not paranoid. I’m not a cowboy   …     but I wanna be prepared. ” He is also a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA). The Eagles of Death Metal will be returning to Paris on February 16. Hughes says the band has “a sacred duty” to play in Paris again they owe it to fans who survived the heinous attack. The Bataclan has yet to reopen following the November 13 attacks. Hughes said, “We need to be the first band there, we need to walk into that place unafraid. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
