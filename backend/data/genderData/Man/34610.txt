While the company has never sold the product directly to prisons and therefore can’t make guarantees, we are confident that our new distribution program will play a substantial role in restricting prisons’ access to Nembutal for misuse as part of lethal injection.”  Lundbeck also states that it ”adamantly opposes the distressing misuse of our product in capital punishment.”   July 7, 2011   Humberto Leal Garcia Jr. a Mexican national, is executed by lethal injection in Texas for the 1994 kidnap, rape and murder of Adra Sauceda in San Antonio.

Witness accounts differ as to whether he was gasping for air or snoring as he died. September 4, 2014   The Oklahoma Department of Public Safety issues a report on the controversial April execution of inmate Clayton Lockett. Complications with the placement of an IV into Lockett played a significant role in problems with his execution, according to the report.

November 19, 2014   A Utah legislative committee votes   to endorse a bill that will allow the execution of condemned prisoners by firing squad if drugs needed for lethal injection are not available.

The moratorium will be in place until a task force examining capital punishment in Pennsylvania issues its final report. February 18, 2015   Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams announces he has filed a petition to block Gov. Wolf halting executions. Williams says the moratorium is an ”unconstitutional takeover of powers.” March 23, 2015   Utah Governor Gary Herbert signs legislation making the firing squad an authorized method of death if the drugs required for lethal injection are unavailable. May 20, 2015   The Nebraska legislature passes a bill to repeal the state’s death penalty and replace it with life without parole.

June 29, 2015   The Supreme Court rules, in a   decision, that the use of the sedative midazolam in lethal injections is not a violation of the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Midazolam is one of three drugs that are combined to carry out the death penalty in Oklahoma. After the long, messy execution of Clayton Lockett on April 29, 2014, at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, public safety officials conducted a review to determine whether midazolam is potent enough on its own to prevent severe pain when the deadly drugs are administered. They ultimately concluded that the sedative is safe and effective, even though the drug is not approved by the FDA as a general anesthetic for surgery.   October 19, 2015   Ohio delays executions until 2017, citing difficulties getting the necessary drugs.  May 23, 2016   The Supreme Court rules   in favor of black death row inmate Timothy Foster, who contended there was racial discrimination in his 1987 jury selection.

Attorney General Matt Denn later announces that he will not appeal the decision made by the state’s high court.

February 22, 2017   The Supreme Court rules in favor of Duane Buck, a death row inmate in Texas whose own lawyers introduced evidence at trial that he was more likely to be dangerous in the future because he is black. April 15, 2017   A federal judge in Arkansas issues an injunction halting the execution by lethal injection of nine inmates, saying the prisoners will likely succeed in demonstrating the state’s proposed method of execution is unconstitutional. A state judge had effectively stopped the executions the previous night, citing concerns over the lethal injection method. April 20, 2017   The US Food and Drug Administration rules that imported vials of the execution drug sodium thiopental, ordered by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and the Arizona Department of Corrections, must be destroyed or exported within 90 days. The FDA had seized the shipment in 2015. Sodium thiopental is part of lethal   cocktail and is not approved in the United States. April 2017    Of the eight prisoners Arkansas had planned to execute before the end of the month, when the state’s supply of lethal injection drug expires, four are put to death: Ledell Lee, Jack Jones, Marcel Williams, and Kenneth Williams.
