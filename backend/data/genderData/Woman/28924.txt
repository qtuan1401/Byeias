On Monday’s “CNN Newsroom,” CNN Commentator and Morehouse College Professor Marc Lamont Hill stated that, “here in America, we say there’s a moral failure of police violence. There’s a moral failure of police terrorism attacks. And there’s a moral failure of gun culture, for all people. We need to change that. ”  Hill stated that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani calling Black Lives Matter “racist” was “bizarre,” in part because, “black people don’t have the institutional power to be racist or to deploy racism. ” Hill added that Black Lives Matter has “called for nonviolence. And because a few people entered that space, and kind of colonized that space, and do something other than what the movement is about, doesn’t mean the movement is wrong. In the same way the Tea Party movement called for fiscal responsibility, but there were racists at the rallies, I’ve been to some Tea Party rallies, there were racists there. But I wouldn’t say the Tea Party is a racist movement as such. I would say that there are people who invaded and divert the movement. ” He continued, “And to say that it’s  . There’s nothing more american than expressing dissent. There’s nothing more American than saying that we’re moving in the wrong direction. It’s only when black people move and  —   say the country’s moving in the wrong direction that they say it’s   or go back if you don’t  —   love it or leave it. When conservatives in the 80s and the 90s said, America’s moving in the wrong direction, when the Moral Majority said, we’re having a moral failure as a nation. No one said, well, if you don’t like it, leave it. They said, okay, we’ll try to change it. So, now here in America, we say there’s a moral failure of police violence. There’s a moral failure of police terrorism attacks. And there’s a moral failure of gun culture, for all people. We need to change that. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
