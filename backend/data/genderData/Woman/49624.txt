’   Crude oil futures are on a tear in Asia, jumping around 5%   following news that some   members will join their OPEC   compatriots in reducing output levels in 2017. ’ ’     Brent Crude futures  —   the global benchmark price  —     have jumped by 4. 82% sitting at $US56. 95 per barrel. ’ ’   As seen in the chart below, that’s a level that’s not been seen   since July 2015. ’ ’   It’s now rallied over 30% from   extending the gain   from the   low see earlier this year to over   110%. ’ ’   The gains are being driven by an agreement from   crude   producers  —   including Russia  —   to cut production levels by   558, 000 barrels per day, or around 0. 6% of global supply, next   year, following . ’ ’   “The   commitment is lower than the   [thousands of   barrels per day] originally outlined in OPEC’s November 30 deal,   but it is still a significant step forward for OPEC and     cooperation to control supply,” said Vivek Dhar, mining and   energy commodities analyst at the Commonwealth Bank. ’ ’’ ’   “Russia has agreed to cut production by   from     highs, while Mexico, Oman, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan pledged to   reduce output by       and   respectively. ’ ’   “The remaining   of oil production cuts will be shared   amongst Bahrain, Brunei, Equatorial Guinea, Malaysia, Sudan and   South Sudan,” he says. ’ ’   Providing added impetus to the rally, Saudi Arabia also flagged   the potential to make deeper cuts to production levels already   announced in late November. ’ ’   “Saudi Arabia even suggested that it will cut output even more   than it is required to do so next year, showing that the historic   deal has credibility,” says Dhar. ’ ’   “With around 1. 8% of global supply set to be removed from oil   markets early next year, markets may now come into balance by   early as 2Q17 and keep prices sustainably above $  in   2017. ” ’
