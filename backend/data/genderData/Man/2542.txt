WASHINGTON  —   Even presidents dip into their savings when they are getting ready to switch jobs. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, cashed out nearly $1 million in investments last year, according to their 2015 tax return, which the White House released on Friday. The figure suggests that they were preparing to finance large expenses like a home purchase. Mr. Obama said last month that the family would remain in the Washington area after he left the White House in January 2017, while his younger daughter, Sasha, finishes high school. The tax return, released before the filing deadline on Monday, shows that the Obamas earned $436, 065 last year and paid $81, 472 in total tax  —   an effective rate of about 18. 7 percent. They are getting a refund of $22, 859. The Obamas sold Treasury notes amounting to $994, 941, according to the return. The White House declined to give an explanation for the sales. But it is clear that the Obamas will face an array of new costs over the next year, including a likely home purchase and the first year of college for Malia, their older daughter. She is said to be considering Stanford and Harvard, where tuition and other costs exceed $66, 000 for the coming academic year. Unlike in previous years, the Obamas opted to take their refund instead of applying it to the next year’s tax payment. The return also showed: • Falling income. The Obamas earned about $40, 000 less than in the previous year, largely the result of a steep decline in royalties from the president’s two autobiographies, “Dreams From My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope. ” Their primary source of income was Mr. Obama’s $400, 000 salary, which was unchanged from 2014. But the roughly $60, 000 he earned from sales of the books in 2015 amounts to nearly $35, 000 less than the year before  —   and a far cry from the $8. 1 million they brought in 2008 and 2009. The family’s charitable contributions totaled more than what the books generated last year. • Giving back. The Obamas donated about 15 percent of their income  —   $64, 066  —   to charity. The largest single contribution, about $9, 000, was to Fisher House, a   favorite of the Obamas that provides accommodations to the families of service members who are receiving treatment at military and veterans’ hospitals.
