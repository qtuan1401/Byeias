On Friday, MSNBC covered Black Lives Matter activists and other protesters marching along Chicago’s Michigan Avenue to disrupt Black Friday shopping while demanding citizen oversight of the police department.  Blake McCoy reported, “These protesters are on the move, shutting down Michigan Avenue as they walk. We’re in front of Crate  Barrel right now where they have been blocking the entrance here in Chicago. The protesters are pushing for more citizen oversight of the police department here in Chicago after several high profile questionable police shootings. They are demanding action. In the last year, since the last time they held one of these protests, the police chief has resigned and there’s a new states attorney here in Chicago. There has been progress in the reform that these folks are seeking. They say it doesn’t go far enough. They want more citizen oversight. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
