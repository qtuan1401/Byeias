I tried out a few   different websites that allow you to see what candidates will be   on your ballot, and thought ’s site was the most comprehensive and easy to   understand. ” ’   Under ”What’’s on my ballot?” you put the address in where you are   registered to vote (you have to provide an email address but you   can uncheck the ”contact me” box) and the site spits out what   choices you have to make. ’ ’’ ’   For the national presidential and congressional races, the site   provides short bios of the candidates, and gives you links to   their campaign pages and social media accounts. If you create a   profile, you can even save which candidates you want to vote for   and send them to yourself so you have a reference for Election   Day. ’ ’   Time to put democracy in action  —   study up! ’
