Breitbart News was able to capture footage of the bloody melee which occurred in broad daylight:[Graphic footage below:   The brawl between the Klansmen and     left at least one man in critical condition. Blood was splattered all over the sidewalk, staining it red. At one point, activists rushed at the group and Klansmen can we seen prodding opposing activists with a flag pole. “I heard from people involved in the scuffle that Klan members started pulling out weapons immediately,” one witness said. Another told Breitbart News that he drove a long distance to the event “to stand directly against what the KKK stands for. I even brought my redneck truck. ” Some of the counter protesters can be heard screaming, “F*ck racism!”
