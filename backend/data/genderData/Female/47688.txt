’  ’ ’   Headphones are on the verge of a revolution. ’ ”   Apple is reportedly ditching the 3. 5 mm headphone   jack . And further  ’s   status as an alternative   connector  —   the   implication being that it could one day serve as the 3. 5 mm   jack’s successor on future Android phones and laptops. Some    have started the process already. ” ’   All this time, headphones based on  and  connectors have slowly started to sprout. ’ ’ raises the question of how headphone   companies  —   the groups most likely to be affected by a   fundamental shift to headphones as a category  —   feel about   being taken along for the ride. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   At the same time, they stop short of   enthusiasm.   Companies are still in the process of sorting out what new   challenges the headphone jack’s death would bring. Some expressed   skepticism over the purported benefits of Lightning and  . In   general, there’ll be lots of waiting and seeing in the coming   months. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’ is detachable cables. Many prominent   and     headphones have wires that can be swapped out in the   event of damages. It turns out that this was a     measure, too. If you own an iPhone ’ ’   Cable sales could become a boosted source of revenue for various   headphone makers. CEO Val   Kolton says that his company is working on a     cable with its   .  head   Jonathan Levine says that his company plans to launch a wireless     headphone that’’s also ”designed to be  .” ’ ”   A company like    already makes a    that works with 3. 5 mm and a separately sold Lightning cable, and   CEO Sankar Thiagasamudram says that it’ll put out a   model   at some point in the future. There’ll be others. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   The main result everyone expects here is an expedited shift to   wireless. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   Naturally, those who’ve already devoted much of their resources   to Bluetooth are thrilled about this shift. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’      ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I think in the near term, you’’re going to see [a performance   boost] in the more expensive headphones,” said Jeff Hutchings,   Skullcandy’’s director of engineering and innovation. ”Just   because, especially in the case of Lightning, there’’s a pretty   significant cost increase just to put the base audio interface in   there. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   There are a few things to take away from this. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ”   though, then it’d risk alienating a chunk of the market on two   separate occasions. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’      ’ ’          ’ ’ that’’s probably true.
