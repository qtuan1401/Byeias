Who do you think she’s talking about?” Michelle Collins shot back, “Let me get my cigar out and think about it, OK? I’m just saying, I have to think about it. No, I mean, come on. We all know who she’s talking about. And I gotta say, for me, Hillary staying with Bill is a major selling point for me —  for Hillary. It shows me she can commit. She’s a woman.
