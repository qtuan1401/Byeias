Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ recent ABC Nightline interview made the Top Stories section of Bing today with a headline mocking Nightline host Terry Moran’s interview skills: “Interview Goes Badly. ”[The aggregated headlines in the Bing news result noted how Moran slid into   during his interview of Milo. The interview, which aired earlier this week featured ABC Nightline host Terry Moran attacking Milo, calling him an “idiot” “revolting” and comparing him to a “13 year old” child.   The main topic of the interview was Milo’s recent Twitter ban and the recent trolling of Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones, which has been repeatedly and disingenuously blamed on Milo throughout the media.  Moran asked Milo whether or not he would call Leslie Jones “a dude” to her face to which Milo replied that he “probably would” this greatly angered Moran who said, “Then you’re an idiot. ” Discussing the body positivity and “healthy at any size” movement, Moran queried Milo “You’re going to go after somebody’s body to go after their ideas, what grade are you in? Are you a   ?” Milo then explained his particular brand of   saying, “If my rudeness creates conversation, provokes people into saying ‘oh what a monster’ and then 20% of people start talking about what I was actually saying, I will consider my career to be a terrific success. ” Moran at this point in the interview had shown himself to be considerably biased against Yiannopoulos, blaming him for Leslie Jones’ Twitter trolling and insulting Yiannopoulos’ intelligence.
