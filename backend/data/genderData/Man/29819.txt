A New Berlin, WI English teacher is facing felony charges on two counts of sexual assault of a student, per WISN.  It is believed that Sara Domres, 28, and one of her former students had a relationship that lasted nearly a year before some of the student’s concerned friends reportedly told authorities of the relationship. After an investigation, police discovered handwritten notes thought to be from Domres. One message read, “Baby Boo, I love you now  forever! Please be mine forever  ever. Always, your baby girl. P. S. Good luck on your quiz [smiley face]. ” The student, now 17, told authorities that he and Domres had relations   times, mostly at a local park and ride or at a motel while the boy was 16 years old. One sexual encounter took place the same night as Domres’  ’s bachelor party. Police later found over 1, 100 text messages between the two. “Hopefully you’ve been thinking of me Baby Boo. I should go because he will be home soon. I love you. Be good, think of me and no one else! Ha ha. ,” said a message from Domres. Once school officials caught wind of a possible relationship, Domres was placed on administrative leave. An investigation found a Google search for “What’s the prison sentence for a teacher sleeping with a student?” on Domres’ phone. The report says Domres could face up to six years in prison and a $10, 000 fine per count if convicted. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
