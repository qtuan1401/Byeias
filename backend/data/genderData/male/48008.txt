’  ’ ’   Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszu narrowly missed setting a new   world record in the   individual medley during the   prelims on Saturday afternoon in Rio, and as she raced against   the clock her husband went absolutely bananas in the stands. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Hosszu is the heavy favorite to take home gold in the event,   which will happen on Saturday night. But she and her husband are   perhaps better known in the swim world because of their   uncommon and intense   dynamic. ’ ’   In a recent  titled ”The Couple Who   Raise Eyebrows at the Olympic Pool,” the swimmer Jessica   Hardy questioned Tusup. ’ ’   ”I’ve seen a lot of inappropriate and  . K. behavior in   Shane,”  ’ ’   She added: “I’ve seen coaches exhibit that kind of behavior in   training, but this is another level. It’s scary. ” ’ ’   Hosszu and Tusup maintain that they are able to separate the     dynamic from their marriage. ’ ’  ’ ”   If nothing else, Tusup is perhaps the most energetic   noncompetitor we’ve seen so far in Rio.  ” ’Update: Hosszu took home gold in the 400m   IM, shattering the world record in the process. Tusup went wild   from the pool deck. ’ ’  ’
