On Super Tuesday after five victories in Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas,  Democratic   Hillary Clinton said, declared that America needs “more love and kindness,” which she said was preferable to “building walls. ”  Clinton said, “This country belongs to all of us, not just those at the top. Not just the people who look one way, worship one way or even think one way. America is strong when we’re all strong. We know we’ve got work to do. That work, that work is not to make America great again. America never stopped being great. We have to make America whole. We have to fill in what’s been hollowed out.  We have to make strong the broken place, restitch the bonds of trust and respect across our country. Now, it might be unusual, as I’ve said before, for a presidential candidate to say this, but I’m going to keep saying it. I believe what we need in America today is more love and kindness. ” “You know what?” she continued. “It works. Instead of building walls, we’re going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment. So every American can live up to his or her potential, because then and only then can America live up to its full potential too. It’s clear tonight that the stakes in this election have never been higher, and the rhetoric we’re hearing on the other side has never been lower. Trying to divide America between us and them is wrong, and we’re not going to let it work. Whether we like it or not, we’re all in this together my friends. We all have to do our part. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
