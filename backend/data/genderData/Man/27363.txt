This week’s “Saturday Night Live” was hosted by “Seinfeld” star Julia  .  The cold open was a remake of the Democratic presidential debate held this week in Brooklyn, NY. Larry David, a “Seinfeld” producer, played Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) while Kate McKinnon played Hillary Clinton, and the two debated some before taking questions from the audience. One of the audience members was   playing her “Seinfeld” character Elaine Benes. David as Sanders evaded the question asking how he would break up big banks by saying, “Once I’m elected president, I’ll have a nice scvhitz in the White House gym, I’ll sit them down and yadda yadda yadda, they’ll be broken up. ” “Elaine” then asked “Sanders” if he thought the super rich should pay more in taxes, even those who were actors on very successful sitcoms.
