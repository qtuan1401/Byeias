On Friday’s broadcast of PBS’ “Washington Week,” TIME Magazine Washington Bureau Chief Michael Scherer stated that a memo released by WikiLeaks “undercuts the Clinton line that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative were really altruistic   efforts. ” And “it’s clear from this memo that the same operation that was raising money for Haiti or AIDS drugs was making Bill Clinton rich. ”  Scherer said, “The remarkable thing I think is that it undercuts the Clinton line that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative were really altruistic   efforts.  You know, they have helped a lot of people. There are some programs that have been very beneficial in parts of the world. But it’s clear from this memo that the same operation that was raising money for Haiti or AIDS drugs was making Bill Clinton rich. And they  —   and the same operation, Doug Band, who was raising money for the foundation on one hand, says I’m, at the same time, without being paid by anyone, the person responsible for getting Bill these   speaking engagements, for getting him these contracts. And, at the same time, I have my own private list of clients who Chelsea Clinton, we know, has accused Doug of trading on Bill Clinton’s name. So there just weren’t these lines of divisions that you would want. And I think the damage there is undercutting the defense that the Clinton campaign has used for months now. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
