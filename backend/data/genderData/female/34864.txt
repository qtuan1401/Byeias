 (CNN) Let the games begin.  Season 13 of ”The Bachelorette” premiered Monday night and viewers watched as 31 men did anything and everything for a shot at love with Rachel Lindsay. These men had clearly brushed up on previous seasons because they pulled out all the stops.

Although one might think that was a bit too soon for such extreme physical contact, she seemed to find it romantic.  Blake E. 31, who had already met Lindsay during the ”After The Final Rose” episode for ”The Bachelor” in March, made up for his awkward first impression by hiring a marching band for his grand entrance. Matt, 32, a construction sales rep, opted for a penguin costume instead of a suit and told Lindsay that ”once penguins find their soul mates they tend to mate for life and with any luck I hope that’s me.”  Lindsay seemed to approve of the costume, as her response was ”I love that. I love penguins even more now.”  From jumping out of the back of an ambulance to bringing new meaning to ”breaking the ice,” the suitors definitely got creative.  But despite the fun and games, Lindsay made it very clear that she is on a mission    to find her husband.  ”I want to be married. I want a family. I want children,” she told one of the men. ”I’m at that point in my life . .. I’m looking for someone who makes me feel something that none of the other guys do.” One of the contestants who is clearly a frontrunner this season is Bryan, a chiropractor from Miami. He managed to lock lips with Lindsay not once but twice. Suffice to say she gave him the first impression rose.  Tune into ABC every Monday night to watch the contestants compete for Lindsay’s heart. May the best man win.
