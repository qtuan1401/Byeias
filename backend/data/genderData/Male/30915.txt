A naked statue of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton caused a fight Tuesday morning in downtown Manhattan.  The statue depicted Clinton with hoofed feet and a Wall Street banker resting his head on her bare breasts.  NY Daily News reports the statue was up for less than three hours before an enraged woman knocked it over and yelled at the artist who created it. In the video, a woman, identified by NY Daily News as Nancy, can be seen struggling with the artist,    Anthony Scioli. As Scioli tried to set the statue back up, Nancy sat on it to prevent him. “This lady shows up and tips it over and starts assaulting anyone who tried to put it back up! ,” a witness told NY Daily News.
