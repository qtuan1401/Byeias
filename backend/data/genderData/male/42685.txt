 (CNN) Rocky Balboa is back    sort of. ”Creed” is the latest addition to the ”Rocky” movie franchise, which began in 1976, well before the star of this new film was even born. Michael B. Jordan, 28, stars as Adonis Johnson Creed, a boxer who is the son of Balboa’s former opponent Apollo Creed (played by Carl Weathers). In the first trailer for the film, we learn that the young Creed didn’t really know his father, who was killed in the ring by Soviet boxer Ivan Drago (played by Dolph Lundgren) in 1985’s ”Rocky IV.” In ”Creed,” Sylvester Stallone revives his role as Balboa to help the son of the man who died in his arms. Jordan, who’s also starring in August’s ”Fantastic Four,” won critical acclaim for his lead role in the 2013 drama ”Fruitvale Station.” ”Creed” is directed by Ryan Coogler, who also directed that film.  ”Creed” is set for release in November.
