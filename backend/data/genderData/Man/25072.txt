You’ve raised me my whole life, from putting my hair in tight Princess Leia buns, forging my signature in fifth grade (I got grounded for that by the way) jamming out to alternative music, going on Warped Tour and even our first rock concert together, leading up to us laughing at cats wearing leggings. I know we are so weird together, but that’s what makes you you and I can’t imagine not having you in my life. I’m so grateful to be able to call you dad. He opened the box, which contained a Batman vs. Superman onesie and candies. He found the adoption papers at the bottom. Misty told him, “That’s the main surprise. ” Ryan said he always wanted to adopt her. Misty told her friends four people sent her video to Ellen DeGeneres.
