.@HillaryClinton: My work as Secy. of State was not influenced by any outside forces  https:  .  Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton defended the Clinton Foundation and her association with it during her tenure as secretary of state.  Clinton told   Mika Brzezinski it was on the    and claimed her work as secretary of state “was not influenced by any outside forces” with regards to their charitable foundation. “Mika, I am sure and I am sure because I have a very strong foundation, understanding about the foundation   …     that the kind of work that the foundation has done, which attracted donors from around the world. It is work that went right in to providing services to people as we have said before. Neither my husband, my daughter nor I have ever taken a penny of salary from the foundation. ” “My work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces,” she continued. “I made policy decisions based on what I thought was right  —   to keep Americans safe and protect our interests abroad. I believe my aides also acted appropriately. And we have gone above and beyond, most of the charities that I understand, beyond the legal requirements, beyond standards, to voluntarily disclose donors, and also to reduce sources of funding that raised any questions, not that we thought they were necessarily legitimate. But to avoid those questions. So we’re going to go at this I believe in the right way. I’m trying to make sure the good work continues as we wind it down. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
