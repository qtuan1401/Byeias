Monday on CNN’s “The Axe Files” podcast, while speaking to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton super PAC strategist, Paul Begala, host and chief strategist for both of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns David Axelrod said Clinton did not handle the controversy over her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state well, instead offering several contradictory explanations which caused her numbers to take a “dive. ”  Axelrod said, “Part of the problem is she said it in a lot of different ways and with a lot of different tones and a few different explanations and it hadn’t been well handled. It just hasn’t been well handled   …     Her numbers took a dive after that. ”
