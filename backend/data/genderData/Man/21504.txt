House Speaker Paul Ryan’s challenger for his seat in the U. S. House of Representatives Paul Nehlen said Thursday on Fox Business Network’s “Lou Dobbs Tonight” that the “Angel Moms” tried to present Ryan with a letter outside of his mansion only to for him to be whisked away, leaving them in the dust. [Before the interview, Nehlen’s ad featuring American mothers who have lost their children as a result of illegal alien crime aired.  Partial transcript as follows: “Those ‘Angel Moms’ tried to contact Paul Ryan before. Those ‘Angel Moms’ are American mothers who came from around the country. They tried to contact Speaker Ryan before they came up there, but he wouldn’t listen to them so they came up and they spoke outside of Paul Ryan’s personal border wall around his mansion. And then they tried to present him with a letter, and in that letter it said, ‘Speaker Ryan, if you cared as much about our families as you care about your donors, our kids might still be alive. ’” “You know, Speaker Ryan was leaving his house at that time. He hopped into his SUV and he was whisked away to a picnic and left those women in the dust. So, I would argue that if Speaker Ryan had listened to them ahead of time, they wouldn’t have done that but there is nobody to advocate for them. They reached out to me because they know I’m running against Speaker Ryan. They wanted an advocate and I’m a willing advocate on their behalf. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
