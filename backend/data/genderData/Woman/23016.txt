Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders signed a document declaring a “We Believe in Marriage Week” when he was the mayor of Burlington, Vermont. [A bombshell document shows that the Burlington City Council approved a 1982 resolution to celebrate marriage as an institution between a man and a woman. Sanders is now running a staunchly   marriage campaign.  The resolution provides that “WHEREAS the basic building block of the American society has always been the family and  —   WHEREAS, the family has been the keeper of society’s values and WHEREAS, marriage should be viewed as a lifelong commitment between husband and wife filled with mutual respect and open, honest communication. ” The resolution expressed “hope that the institution of marriage may once again be revered as the cornerstone of the American society and its way of life. ” Mayor Bernie Sanders’ handwritten signature graces the document on page two. Sanders has presented himself as a longtime advocate for gay marriage who has helped to “radically transform”   marriage culture in America.  The Sanders campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.
