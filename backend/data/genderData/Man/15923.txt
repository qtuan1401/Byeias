HBO has released an extended trailer for Confirmation, which stars Kerry Washington as Anita Hill. [The film explores the 1991 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in which Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment while he was her boss at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  In addition to starring as Hill, Washington produced the film. Confirmation also stars Jennifer Hudson, Greg Kinnear, Jeffrey Wright, and Eric Stonestreet. Wendell Pierce stars as Clarence Thomas. Washington previously said she was “terrified” to play Hill because of the responsibility of playing a person who is alive. She added that the film is important because it comes as issues of sexual assault and race continue to dominate today’s news headlines. Confirmation will debut on April 16 on HBO.
