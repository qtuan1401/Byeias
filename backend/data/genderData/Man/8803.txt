Facebook has reinstated the popular “Polandball” comedy page, following coverage of their “permanent suspension” by Breitbart News. [The page, which focuses on “  satire,” was originally notified by Facebook that they would be permanently deleted on Saturday for unknown reasons.  “We’re very sorry about this mistake,” said a Facebook spokesman in an email to Breitbart Tech. “A post was removed in error, which led to the removal of the page. Both the post and page have been restored. ” Polandball announced on their reinstated Facebook page that they would be keeping both the original and the backup page in case they are removed by error again in the future.
