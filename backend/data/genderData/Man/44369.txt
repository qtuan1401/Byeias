’  ’ ”   We’re hearing from sources that when  neither the     Surface Pro 5 tablet nor the   Surface   Phone will be making appearances.  ” ”   Just to back up for a second, the   Surface Phone   is considered to be Microsoft’s very last shot at making Windows   a serious smartphone contender against Apple and Google, as   . Microsoft   hasn’t shipped a flagship Windows phone since late 2015’s Lumia   950. ” ”   And while you can read pretty much anything into the Surface   Phone’s absence, the fact we’re hearing it won’t be shown at   least indicates it’s probably still in the works  —   something that   was in  after going .  ” ”   That’s exacerbated by years of reports indicating that it’s been   a bumpy road for Microsoft. Originally rumored to be unveiled in     the  (or maybe early 2018, if   you ). And . ” ’   Meanwhile, Microsoft has filled the gap in its own smartphone   lineup by doubling down on iOS and Android. Notably,  making it the most premium   Microsoft phone on the market. ’ ”   Now, with   baying for the company to recommit to   Windows on phones, but the rest of the world increasingly   apathetic, Microsoft is damned if it does release a Surface   Phone, and damned if it doesn’t. ” ’   The rumor is that this hypothetical Surface Phone will be a   powerful flagship Windows 10 Mobile phone with at least one   absolutely killer feature: The ability to plug it into a   keyboard, mouse, and monitor and use it like an        Windows PC, letting you run desktop   PC software on a device you can pocket. ’ ’   It sounds great on paper. But it seems extremely unlikely that   even if Microsoft releases the coolest, most innovative phone   ever made, it could get anybody to care. ’ ’  ’ ’   Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made a big bet on  where developers can   write Windows 10 apps that run on PCs, tablets, and smartphones   alike. But apart from a few   apps from developers   like Uber and Facebook, the Windows Store is still pretty dire,   as most developers pass over Windows 10 for the way more popular   iPhone and Android platforms.  ’ ’   And given that Windows 10 Mobile currently doesn’’t have apps like   Snapchat or ”Pokémon Go,” and that  are pulling their Windows phone apps   as market share vanishes, good luck getting an iPhone or Android   user to switch. ’ ”   So it almost doesn’t matter what the Surface Phone turns out to   be. Unless it’s a massive,   hit like the first   iPhone, it’s not going to draw enough developers back to the   Windows Store to make a difference.    with the iPhone   or Google Pixel, this phone could maybe win a battle. But Windows   10 Mobile won’t win any kind of war. ” ”   When Microsoft and Samsung announced their Galaxy S8   collaboration, Windows fans weren’t happy. To them, the   partnership was a signal that Microsoft cared a lot more about   Android than it does about Windows 10 Mobile. ” ’       ”Just put Windows mobile out of it’’s [sic] misery       already and stop yanking us around,”  in part, following the news.     ’ ”   Indeed,  is a huge step towards   fulfilling the Surface Phone dream, built on Android. With   Microsoft giving the Galaxy S8 an explicit endorsement, it   definitely looks like they’ve given up on their own phone   platform. ” ’  ’ ”   And yet, Microsoft can’t throw in the towel. With  Microsoft needs to prove to itself and   the world that Windows is still relevant. So while the company is   working on  that’s probably a . ” ”   In the meantime, smartphones are here to stay. And so, whether or   not it’s a huge hit, Microsoft needs something like a Surface   Phone . Windows 10 on PCs   and tablets is pretty great, but without a smartphone, the   platform appears a little  . ” ”   If you’re a Star Trek fan, this is Microsoft’s own     —   a   scenario that tests your priorities under an   impossible situation. ” ”   If Microsoft opts not to release a phone, it’s a clear sign that   it’s taking the far more realistic approach of providing apps and   services for Android and iOS phones, which is a lucrative   business for the company. That comes at the very possible cost of   Windows’ future prospects as the world continues to move towards   the smartphone, but the continued growth of its Office 365   subscription service. ” ’  ’ ”   But if Microsoft does release a phone, it shows that the company   is committed to Windows, one of the very major reasons it became   a titan of technology in the first place. This has a potentially   higher payoff, as it could be the breakthrough device   that pushes Windows 10 Mobile into the mainstream, and ensure   Windows’ relevance for another several years. Or it could keep   Microsoft shackled to a shrinking, legacy business. ” ”   In other words, Microsoft can’t win with the Surface Phone. It   can, however, choose the way that it loses. ” ’ If you know more about the Microsoft Surface Phone, you can   contact the reporter via   at    or via secure Telegram message at @. ’ ”We’re hearing from sources that when Microsoft. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
