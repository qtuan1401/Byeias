While being Mexico’s most wanted fugitive, the now    drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman was able to visit relatives in California twice, his older daughter said. [Rosa Isela Guzman Ortiz, claimed in an interview with The Guardian that during one of those visits in 2015, her father came to see a home that he bought for her in California, and to visit other relatives.   The drug lord’s daughter did not disclose how the famous drug lord was able to fool U. S. border security and law enforcement in order to enter the country.  As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, in July 2015, Guzman was able to escape from one of Mexico’s maximum security prisons with the help of corrupt officials and by using a mile long tunnel that had been outfitted with a motorcycle powered rail car.  The escape by the head of the Sinaloa Cartel was the second time the drug lord had fled from a maximum security prison. His escape delivered a heavy blow to the already diminishing credibility of the Mexican government.  Guzman Ortiz claims that her fathers escape was in fact brokered with high officials in the Mexican government.  The government’s credibility became even more questionable by the daughter’s claims that the billionaire drug lord financed political campaigns and paid off Mexican public officials at the highest levels in exchange for protection.
