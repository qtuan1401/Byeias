Just when most Olympic athletes and coaches realize that circumstances surrounding the Rio Games couldn’t get more dangerous and disgusting, on Friday Olympic officials offered a coup de grâce by losing the keys to the Maracana, the site of the opening ceremonies. [Friday, firefighters arrived at the venue’s main entrance with bolt cutters:  What a start! #Rio2016 kicking off with lost key and firemen forcing open lock to east gate of Olympic stadium #oops pic. twitter.   —   Julia Carneiro (@juliadcarneiro) August 3, 2016,  Breitbart has reported extensively over the last month that a number of athletes have chosen to stay elsewhere given the existences of unsanitary conditions at Rio’s athlete’s village. Some of the issues include broken plumbing, gas leaks, leaking ceiling and walls, feces infested waterways, the prevalence of diseases such as Zika, and a high rate of crime.  Given all the negative issues maybe firefighters should have just left the gates locked and everyone should go home.
