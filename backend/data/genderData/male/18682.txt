[From ProPublica:  ‘A Strategic Vacuum’ Current and former Obama administration officials, including some who sparred with the State Department over Iraq policy, defend Clinton as one of the most vocal advocates for a muscular U. S. presence in Iraq after the withdrawal deadline. Clinton argued publicly and privately for keeping a contingent of U.
