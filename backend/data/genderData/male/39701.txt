 (CNN) Think twice before complaining on your next Korean Air flight    flight crew can now use Tasers to deal with   disturbances.  The airline has made the decision to loosen its Taser usage policy after a violent incident on a flight last week resulted in ’80s’ pop star Richard Marx having to subdue an unruly passenger.    crew already have had Tasers on hand for years but could only use them when lives or the physical safety of passengers and cabin crew was threatened. But new rules will allow for ”more active use” of Tasers, a Korean Air spokesperson told CNN.  Employees will also get routine training in security gear, and the male to female ratio of flight crew will be reviewed. Passengers who cause a disturbance will be banned for an indeterminate period. The announcement comes one week after Marx had to help restrain a passenger on board a Korean Air flight. Reports of the incident    and Marx’s scathing assessment of the flight crew’s performance    went viral. The man was tied up with ropes, but broke free of them three times, according to Marx’s wife, ’90s’ MTV VJ Daisy Fuentes. ”A completely   and untrained crew for a situation like this. Four hours of a psycho passenger attacking crew members and other passengers,” Marx wrote on his Facebook page. But at the time, Korean Air defended its flight attendants’ training, saying they had followed ”response protocol” until police boarded at Incheon International Airport. ”The flight attendant considered the safety of the other passengers and decided to restrain the passenger with ropes (rather than a Taser),” the statement said.
