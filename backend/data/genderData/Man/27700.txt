Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Democratic presidential   runner Hillary Clinton admitted that a “consequence” of her husband former President Bill Clinton’s crime bill was “over incarceration. ”  Clinton said, “I gave a speech about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. I have been consistently speaking out about what I would do as president. And I think it’s important for people to recognize we have work to do. that there were a lot of people very scared and concerned about high crime back in the day. And now we’ve got to say, okay, we have to deal with the consequences. And one of the consequences is, in my view, over incarceration of people who should not have been in the criminal justice system. They have an addiction problem. they have committed a   offense, a nonviolence offense. So I want to convert people from the criminal justice system and from being incarcerated, and I want to do more if people are in corrections institutes to help them while they’re there, and i want to do more to help them when they get out,   into society. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
