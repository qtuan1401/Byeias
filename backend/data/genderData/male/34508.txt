 (CNN) Here’s a look at Boko Haram, a militant Islamic group working out of Nigeria, whose purpose is to institute Sharia, or Islamic law.   Facts:In the local Hausa dialect, Boko Haram means ”Western education is forbidden.” The group also refers to itself as Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati   meaning ”People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet’s Teachings and Jihad.” Boko Haram militants mainly inhabit areas in the northern states of Nigeria, specifically Yobe, Kano, Bauchi, Borno and Kaduna.  Originally, Boko Haram was referred to locally as the Nigerian Taliban because of their religious similarities to the Taliban. Boko Haram does not engage in Nigeria’s political system out of an adherence to a fundamentalist form of Islam, which forbids participation unless the system is based on Sharia, or Islamic law.   Timeline:2002   The group, which may have existed since the late 1990s, organizes under the Muslim cleric Mohammed Yusuf. It is centered in Maiduguri, the capital of the northeastern state of Borno.  December 2003   The first known attack by Boko Haram includes roughly 200 militants, who attack multiple police stations in the state of Yobe, near the Niger border. July 2009   The Boko Haram uprising begins in Bauchi and spreads to the states of Borno, Kano and Yobe. The militant group kills scores of police officers. A joint military task force responds, leaving more than 700 Boko Haram members dead and its operational mosque destroyed. The uprising ends when police capture the group’s leader, Mohammed Yusuf. His deputy, Abubakar Shekau, reportedly dies in the uprising. Yusuf later dies in police custody police say he is shot during an attempted escape, but Boko Haram claims it is an extrajudicial execution.   July 2010   Boko Haram releases a video statement in which Yusuf’s deputy who allegedly died the previous year, Abubakar Shekau, claims to be the leader of the group.
