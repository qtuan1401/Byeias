Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed that she believes in “spirits,” even though she is not sure about the existence of ghosts or aliens. [“Do you believe in ghosts?” one of the hosts of The Breakfast Club radio show in New York asked during an interview.  “I believe in spirits,” Clinton replied. When another host mocked the question, Clinton replied, “You don’t?” Clinton’s fascination with the spiritual realm was well known during her time in the White House as First lady. Author Bob Woodward reported in the 1990’s that Hillary Clinton held “seance” conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt and Gandhi in the White House. Bill Clinton also joked about the incident in 2012, during the dedication of Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park in New York. “As all of you famously learned when I served as president, my wife, now the secretary of state, was known to commune with Eleanor on a regular basis,” he joked during his speech.  During the interview, a third host asked her to reveal the truth about aliens visiting the earth, if she became president. “I have said, I want to open the files as much as we can,” she replied, when asked about the UFO files held by the United States government. “If there’s some huge national security thing and I can’t get agreement to open them I won’t, but I do want to open them because I’m interested. ” “Do you believe?” asked one of the hosts. “I don’t know,” Clinton said weakly, before adding that she wanted to see the information first. She went on to patronize UFO conspiracy theorists. “There enough stories out there, that I don’t think everybody is just sitting there in their kitchen just making them up,” she said.
