JAFFA, Israel  —   A former Saudi military officer has been arrested on suspicion of having slaughtered his wife after being radicalized by the Islamic State. [The victim, a Syrian woman and one of the suspect’s two wives, was reportedly found dead by her brother, who notified the police.  Her husband was arrested shortly after a police investigation was launched and admitted to the charges. Police found plans to carry out terrorist attacks in his possession, as well as IS propaganda. Earlier this week,    Saudi twins were indicted for killing their mother and injuring their father in a   attack. Last Friday, Khaled and Saleh Alureini attacked their family with axes and knives, killing their mother and critically injuring their father and brother. Another brother escaped. A statement released by the Saudi Interior Ministry failed to specify their organizational affiliation, but media reports said the twins had been recruited by IS. Meanwhile, the     Saudi newspaper reported on Tuesday that a number of Saudi citizens had been imprisoned for smuggling funds to Syrian jihadists. One of the defendants, who received a   sentence, said that he raised funds for the militants and handed them over to local point men, together with cameras, computers, and phone and camera chargers. Another defendant was convicted of raising tens of thousands of dollars for jihadi purposes in Syria, including financing the journey of one of his relatives to Syria and purchasing cameras. He was charged with belonging to a local charity that raised around $250, 000 for Syrian jihadists. Other defendants were charged with recruiting fighters, travelling to Syria and participating in military training sessions. They were also convicted of using social media for recruitment, especially of women, and propaganda purposes. They were also charged with money laundering in order to finance their terrorist activity.
