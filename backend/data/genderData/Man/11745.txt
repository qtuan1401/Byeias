Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam regarding the CIA and recent Wikileaks revelations and the current state of America’s spy state combined with a growing government bureaucracy. [“We are not immune to authoritarian government in this country,” said Rohrabacher, citing the Obama years and adding “I think we are sliding   …     into an authoritarian mode where the government is running the lives of the people and we have a bureaucracy that is spiteful and jealous about their own power, even over the public, much less over other government entities. ”  “Back when I was younger,” said Rohrabacher, “the book was ‘1984,’ George Orwell’s book was showing how   …     well, a lot of that is coming true. ” “If we are not jealous of our own privacy from government intrusion, at the very least, we’re going to find we’ve lost our freedom,” he concluded.
