On December 29, actor James Woods reacted to newly released details of the heinous November 10 murder of Amanda Blackburn by urging Americans to “buy more guns and learn how to use them. ”[Blackburn was the wife of Pastor Davey Blackburn, who left his home to go the gym on November 10, only to have three suspects enter the home and kill his wife while he was gone.  According to USA Today, police said Amanda was knocked to the floor, then “accused triggerman Larry Taylor” allegedly “leaned over Blackburn’s body and shot the young mother in the back of the head. ” Police said Taylor then “leaned further” and “looked at her face. And he watched her bleed. ” Taylor is also accused of raping a woman on November 3 —  while his accomplices allegedly robbed the woman’s apartment —  and of killing a man on November 4. James Woods responded to these reports not with calls for more gun control, but with a call for more guns in the hands of   citizens who want to defend their own lives, their children’s lives, and their homes.
