A NBC4i report says that police found more than low prices at a New York Walmart on Monday.  Police discovered a meth lab in a drain underneath the parking lot of an Amherst, NY Walmart. The drainage pipe is reportedly tall enough to stand up in and unsecured, allowing anyone access to the meth lab. The lab was found during a random preventative patrol. Captain Scott Chamberlin says Amherst Police is currently investigating, but they do not yet know how long the meth lab has been in use, nor who is in charge of it.
