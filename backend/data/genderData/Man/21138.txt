Actress and supermodel Christie Brinkley grabbed her garden hose on Saturday and doused a woman she caught peeing in an area near her Hamptons mansion. [The squatting intruder was identified as    local resident Erica Remkus. The local hairdresser says she was taken by surprise by the entire incident.  “‘What are you doing? !’” Brinkley shouted, according to Remkus’s version of events, as reported by the New York Post. “‘You can’t pee in front of my house! You have to go away. You’re standing on my rocks. You can’t pee on my rocks. I walk there! ’” Remkus says she didn’t even realize she was doing her business on private property. “These are not your rocks,” Remkus screamed back at Brinkley. “This is not your beach. The beach is public property. You don’t own it. ” That’s when the former Sports Illustrated cover girl pulled out a garden hose and sprayed the woman with water. “I hadn’t even peed yet, by the way,” Remkus told the Post, adding that she decided to urinate after getting hosed. “I would not have peed if she didn’t spray me,” Remkus said. “After that, I kind of had to. ” After the incident, Remkus took to social media and went on a   rant directed at Brinkley. “All I have to say right now is that #‎Christiebrinkley is a dumb b*tch. She f’ed with the wrong real local tonight! ✌️” Remkus wrote in a   post on her personal Facebook page on July 2.  When asked by friends what had happened, Remkus said “It’s a long story  …     “But we had cops involved and she was way way wrong. ” Police interviewed Remkus, but she was not cited, according to the Post. A local official said the women was, in fact, peeing on public property. Brinkley has yet to comment publicly on the incident.  Brinkley’s $15. 75 million,   waterfront home sits on 4. 5 acres of land. She is said to visit her North Haven home on occasion.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
