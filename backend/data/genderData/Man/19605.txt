Herridge said, “The meeting between Attorney General Lynch and Bill Clinton at an Arizona airport only came to light after a local Phoenix reporter had a tip and Lynch was pressed to explain. Today Lynch insisted her plan had always been to go with the recommendations, but the backlash meant she had to go public. ” She continued, “As Fox first reported, the FBI’s criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email as secretary of state has expanded to look at whether the possible intersection of Clinton Foundation work and State Department business may have violated public corruption laws. Bill Clinton is the prime minister of the foundation, and the president of the foundation and at the very least, a witness to the activities. ” Herridge reported, “This morning a   FBI source told Fox News that agents are livid about the Lynch and Clinton meetings in Phoenix since Bill Clinton at the very least may be a a witness in this public corruption probe. ” She added, “I mean these events in the last 24 hours may well . change the outcome of the FBI investigation and whether any charges are pursued and how that will be handled. One analyst said to Fox this morning it does look hike Bill Clinton just cut away Hillary Clinton’s political safety net, taking Lynch effectively out of the equation. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
