On Saturday’s “Smerconish” on CNN, Breitbart editor at large and author of “Clinton Cash” Peter Schweizer stated that “The Clinton Foundation and the Bill Clinton speaking fees are a way around” are ways around federal law preventing foreign nationals from putting money into campaigns to get access, and “So, now we have, influencing our policies and getting favors and access, foreign oligarchs, not just American businesses and citizens. ”  Schweizer said, “We all know that in politics a guy on Wall Street raises money for a candidate, sometimes because they want access and they want favors, but federal law prevents foreign nationals from doing that. If you’re a guy like Gilbert Chagoury, you cannot put money in a campaign to get access, because we don’t want foreign entities getting access and influencing our policymakers. The Clinton Foundation and the Bill Clinton speaking fees are a way around that. That’s why you have guys like Gilbert Chagoury, Frank Giustra, and others sending them large checks. So, now we have, influencing our policies and getting favors and access, foreign oligarchs, not just American businesses and citizens. ” Schwezier added of Chagoury, “I don’t think he is being suggested because of his Lebanese expertise. He’s being suggested because he’s a major Clinton Foundation donor. By the way, he’s somebody with a criminal record, convicted in Switzerland for aiding and abetting a criminal enterprise and money laundering, because he had this slight problem, he helped the Nigerian dictator, Abacha, smuggle billions of dollars out of the country into Swiss bank accounts. And he’s also very controversial in Lebanon. He does not represent a mainstream view of Lebanese opinion. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
