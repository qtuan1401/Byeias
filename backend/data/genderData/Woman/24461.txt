PHILADELPHIA  —   The Democratic National Committee shut down the plot to field a vice presidential challenger to Sen. Tim Kaine   …     by stalling on paperwork! [Breitbart News has learned that the DNC used Office Space tactics to shut down the   effort, which we reported on Monday as it was developing among   delegates on the convention floor. The roll call vote to nominate Hillary Clinton and Kaine will occur Tuesday.  Donna Smith, executive director of Progressive Democrats of America, told Breitbart News that she requested the proper forms to get her   candidate on the ballot for Tuesday’s roll call vote. “We have been working on fielding an alternative candidate for vice president because we felt Tim Kaine was not reflective of a progressive agenda,” Smith said. “We talked to a lot of delegates and found someone who was willing to run if we got the paperwork in on time. ” Smith said that she went to the information desk in the convention center, then to the DNC office on Market Street in Philadelphia, on Monday, to get the candidate forms, taking 45 minutes to park her car. A young male staffer at the DNC office went into a back room then came back out to the front desk and told Smith to send her request for the paperwork to a Democrat Party email account. “I said, ‘Are you sure? That doesn’t seem like a very secure way to get the forms we are looking for,’” Smith said, just days after the contents of a DNC email hack threw the convention into chaos and led to chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s ouster. Smith did not get a response. “They similarly got zero response,” Smith said of other activists who tried to obtain the forms for an   effort. The deadline for filing the forms passed on Tuesday morning, before the   activists received any forms. “We now are outside the window of the time frame for filing paperwork,” Smith said. “It seems like a control issue” on the DNC’s part, Smith said.
