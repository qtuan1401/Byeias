The late recording megstar Prince does not have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  —   not because he could not, but because he decided not to accept the award. [According to The Wrap, the legendary singer had twice been approached for the honor. And in both cases, he declined. He was approached in the 1990s, and again about a year or two ago.  Walk of Fame ceremonies producer Ana Martinez reportedly said Prince was on her “wish list. ” She said that it’s still possible for Prince to receive a star on Hollywood Boulevard, but that due to rules set by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, it would have to wait for another five years, which is the rule set for anyone who has passed away.
