Director Joss Whedon said he wouldn’t work on the iconic British TV series Doctor Who until The Doctor is played by either a woman or black actor Idris Elba. [Whedon, who directed The Avengers films and created the TV hit Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was answering a question from a fan on whether he would work on an episode of the   show.  “I’m not sure, and here’s why. I’d have to do a lot of research, like, watch 40 years of television. I mean I’ve seen some of it, but let’s get real  …     Check back with me when the Doctor is a she. Or Idris Elba. Every question can actually just have the suffix ‘or Idris Elba,” he said.  Elba, a black actor who rose to prominence in the BBC detective series Luther, has been touted as a possible replacement for Daniel Craig as the next James Bond. Whedon has built a reputation for appeasing social justice warriors, previously comparing the #GamerGate movement to the Klu Klux Klan and being known for his support for feminist commentator Anita Sarkeesian. Despite his pandering to social justice warriors, Whedon was run off Twitter following SJW criticism of the portrayal of the character Black Widow in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos described Joss Whedon as “feminism’s battered wife” following the incident.
