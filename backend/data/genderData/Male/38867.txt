Beijing (CNN) Slippery conditions and fog are thought to have contributed to a huge highway pileup that killed 17 people in northeastern China. The crash involved 56 vehicles on the   highway in China’s Shanxi province around 9 a. m. Monday, according to state news agency Xinhua. ”The fog was heavy, so I drove slowly when I exit the tunnel,” one driver involved in the incident told   CCTV. ”I saw two vehicles horizontally blocking the road, so I stepped on the brake.”  It had been snowing and raining before the accident, which also injured 37 people, Xinhua said. Firefighters told CCTV that when they arrived they fought a blaze at the front of the pileup. ”While some of us manned the hoses, a chief officer led the rescue efforts of trapped personnel,” firefighter Wang Ruobing said. A day after the collision the highway was still closed to traffic, according to the Shanxi Traffic Control Center. An investigation is underway.
