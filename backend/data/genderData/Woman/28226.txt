Google and YouTube have demonetized a video from Milo’s recent lecture at the University of Alabama where he discussed the deaths of two Americans who were killed at the hands of an illegal alien drunk driver.[   Just this week, Google and YouTube placed   restrictions on videos from the   Prager University, claiming that although the videos were educational in intent, their sensitive topics did not make them suitable for all audiences. Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos is now on the receiving end of Google’s censorship trend. In a short clip from Milo’s recent lecture at the University of Alabama, he discussed an incident in which two Americans were killed at the hands of an illegal alien drunk driver. Claiming that the content is unfriendly to advertisers, Google removed the video’s monetization capacity. This story will be updated to reflect any changes.
