  people were shot  —   leaving two dead  —   in   Chicago, during a   window from Tuesday to Wednesday. [The     rate comes as fatalities from Chicago shootings  doubled in the seven weeks after Jan. 1, 2016, compared to the same period last year.  The Chicago Tribune described the   shooting spree as a “burst of violence” which “included three shootings in the area of 63rd Street and Sacramento Avenue within two hours. ” Those shootings left one man dead with a gunshot to the back of the head and three others wounded, including two    boys. The other fatality occurred when when someone walked up to a car and opened fire “in the 2100 block of West Maple Street,” shooting a    female passenger in the back and killing her. The shooting on West Maple happened at approximately 12:10 a. m. Wednesday. Others incidents in the   spree including shootings at 6:45 pm Tuesday, 7 pm, 7:35 pm, 8 pm, 8:35 pm, and 10:20 pm, as well as 2:10 am Wednesday, 2:15 am, and 4:20 am. It is worth noting that Chicago has a “violence tax” that raises the price of every gun and bullet sold at retail, and it limits the number of gun stores and the locations of those stores, plus what the New York Times describes as handgun restrictions which let city leaders “get as close as they could get legally to a ban without a ban. ” They also have an “assault weapons” ban —  the very type of ban President Obama has repeatedly called for at the federal level.
