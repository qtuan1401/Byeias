Rafael Cruz, father of GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz and author of A Time for Action: Empowering the Faithful to Reclaim America, said Thursday on Breitbart News Daily: “The election is going to come down to one word, trust. Who can you trust to do exactly what he says he is going to do?”  Cruz joined Breitbart News executive chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon to explain why it’s critical to have a man of God in the White House. “We have been burned way too many times by politicians that say one thing and then do something else,” said Cruz, adding, ” I mention one simple thing in my book and that is, stop listening to their rhetoric and start looking at their record. ” Cruz also highlighted the importance of appointing justices to the Supreme Court, pointing out there could be three or four openings to be filled by the next president: “We are one justice away from the Supreme Court going totally amok. So, we need to make sure we are going to elect a man of character. ” The entire interview can be heard here:
