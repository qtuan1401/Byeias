From The Dallas Morning News: A state investigation is underway over allegations of voter fraud in Tarrant County, according to a report from the Fort Worth  . Concerns have arisen over   ballots, which many believe open the door to “vote harvesting,” or the process of illegally filling out and returning the ballots of valid voters without their consent.   ballots are designed for eligible voters who are unable to leave their homes, are in jail or out of the country, and many argue that such balloting is critical for those who would be unable to vote otherwise. But the   balloting process allows those voters to cast their votes from home without verification of identity, which some say opens the door for abuse. Some believe the investigation is likely politically motivated and might scare some out of voting via   ballots, while others say it is addressing an issue that has existed for years.
