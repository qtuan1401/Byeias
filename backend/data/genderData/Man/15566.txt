The Times of Israel reports:  A soldier was lightly wounded Monday evening during a stabbing attack in the center of Tel Aviv. Security forces arrested a Palestinian teenager near the scene of the attack, after he fled and tried to hide in a residential building. Police said the stabber likely had nationalistic motives and they were therefore treating the incident as terrorism. The attacker was identified as a    resident of the West Bank. Eyewitnesses said the teen shouted “Allaha akbar”  —   the Arabic for “God is great”  —   during the incident. The attack was apparently carried out with a screwdriver, Channel 2 news reported.
