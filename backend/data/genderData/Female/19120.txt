Do you feel strongly about Harambe, the hapless gorilla executed by Cincinnati zoo to protect the life of the   old child Isaiah whose stupid, irresponsible parents allowed him to crawl into the gorilla’s pen? [Well I do too. Especially when you realise  —   at least by some accounts  —   that the gorilla was actually trying to protect the child not kill it.  But I don’t think in the outrage stakes any of us can quite compete with the angry black people in social media forums who have been blaming the incident on entrenched white privilege. That gorilla was taken from it’s homeland, put in captivity, and then killed to preserve White life. That sounds familiar.  —   Isa Ibn (@IsaIbnOfficial) May 29, 2016,  That gorilla was black, unarmed and 17,  —   Kar L.

If the boy was black they would’ve found a tranquilizer.  —   Hood Intellect (@NelsonEmpowered) May 29, 2016,  There’s just one flaw in this GorillaLivesMatter thesis. Can you guess what it is? Wait a minute so you guys spent all day talking about white parenting practices  the gorilla boy is black? Oh boy lol.  —   EdAsante (@EdAsante77) May 29, 2016,
