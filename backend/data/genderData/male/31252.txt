Comedian and gun control advocate Amy Schumer ripped Senate Republicans for not passing legislation to force all   gun buyers to pass the same background check Orlando gunman Omar Mateen passed to acquire his guns. [“I am sickened by the cowardice of these people who are supposed to lead us,” the    Inside Amy Schumer star told Politico after the Senate’s rejection of new gun control measures earlier this week. “Their dedication seems only to be to dollars signs for their own pockets. In November, we will remember who stood with the gun lobby rather than their constituents, as we mourned Orlando. ”  The Orlando gunman passed a background check for his rifle and handgun and submitted to a   waiting period before picking the handgun up from the store. Schumer suggests Republicans are cowards for not passing Senator Chris Murphy’s ( ) bill to require all   to pass that same check at gun shows. In addition to voting against requiring all gun buyers to pass the same background check Mateen passed, Republicans opposed other gun controls that included Senator Dianne Feinstein’s ( ) attempt to create a watch list out of people who used to be on a watch list. Schumer began pushing gun control after alleged gunman John Russell Houser opened fire in a   theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, on July 23, killing two, during a screening of her comedy film Trainwreck. Schumer responded to that incident by pushing for an expansion of background checks that would cover gun shows. Houser did not buy his gun at a gun show. Rather, he bought it at a gun store, and he passed a background check to get it. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
