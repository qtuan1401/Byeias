This week’s Friday afternoon news drop was a blockbuster for Hillary Clinton, with revelations that some of her emails contained information so sensitive they cannot be released to the public at all, others will be delayed beyond the first few primaries by the State Department, and the number of Top Secret documents in her homebrew private email server has risen to 22. [Hillary For America press secretary Brian Fallon released a statement after the intelligence community announced that 20 of Clinton’s emails were too sensitive to ever be released: We firmly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails. Since first providing her emails to the State Department more than one year ago, Hillary Clinton has urged that they be made available to the public. We feel no differently today. After a process that has been dominated by bureaucratic infighting that has too often played out in public view, the loudest and leakiest participants in this interagency dispute have now prevailed in blocking any release of these emails.  This flies in the face of the fact that these emails were unmarked at the time they were sent, and have been called “innocuous” by certain intelligence officials.  We understand that these emails were likely originated on the state Department’s unclassified system before they were ever shared with Secretary Clinton, and they have remained on the department’s unclassified system for years.  And in at least one case, the emails appear to involve information from a published news article. This appears to be   run amok.  We will pursue all appropriate avenues to see that her emails are released in a manner consistent with her call last year.
