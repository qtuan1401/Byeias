A woman died in a stabbing attack last weekend, reportedly in part for “gloating” that the Dallas Cowboys beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, police report. [A police report obtained by NBC   Worth revealed that Austin, Texas resident Magdalena Ruiz was attacked by her own stepson, Pontrey O’Neal Jones, after supposedly taunting her husband over the Cowboys   victory Sunday.  Police say that Ruiz upset the    man after she “disrespected” his father, so he crept up behind her as she sat on the couch then lunged at her, stabbing her several times. Ruiz was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Ruiz’s husband pulled the attacker away, but too late to stop the fatal injuries. Pontrey fled the scene but police later tracked him down and took him into custody after finding him lying naked in a field of tall grass. The suspect’s father, Pontrey Simon, told Fox 7 that his son takes medication for a bipolar disorder. Jones allegedly told police that he planned on killing his stepsister, but turned against his stepmother instead. He is held on a $500, 000 bond, charged with murder.
