Apparently, Hillary Clinton supporter Bill Cosby was unavailable to hurl accusations of sexism at the surging Bernie Sanders. So, instead, Ms. Clinton chose the   possible surrogate at her disposal, her husband Bill Clinton, who has been accused by near a dozen women of everything from outright rape to groping to sexual harassment.  Looking old and tired well beyond his 69 years, Bill Clinton ripped into Sanders Sunday with a bizarre    attack involving some of Sander’s supporters, known as Berniebros. Sanders has disavowed these attacks, saying he does not want support from anyone who would attack Hillary in this way. Speaking about The Nation’s Joan Walsh,   Bill Clinton said, “She and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary and explain  —   just explain  —   why they supported her have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often  —   not to mention sexist  —   to repeat. ” Bill Clinton settled a sexual harassment claim in the 1990’s, attempted to personally destroy Monica Lewinsky as a lying stalker before DNA proved that the most powerful man in the world had indeed seduced a 21   White House intern, and was impeached and disbarred for perjury involving this affair. Using Bill Clinton as a surrogate to pose as a victim of sexism is like using water as a surrogate to pose as a victim of wet. Furthermore, many of these women also claim to be victims of Hillary Clinton’s personal destruction crusades designed to protect their alleged abuser  —   her husband. Knowing the Internet and Democrats like I do, it would not surprise me in the least if many of these “sexist” Berniebros were in reality Hillary supporters posing as Sanders supporters. Regardless, if Hillary wants to accuse fellow Democrats of sexism, the rest of the world should sit back to enjoy the Blue on Blue violence.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
