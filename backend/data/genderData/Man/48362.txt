’  ’ ”   One of Burning Man’s luxury camps was ransacked by vandals   on Wednesday night, according to a post on the camp’s Facebook   page. ” ’   The White Ocean camp hosts dozens of free     concerts at its stage on the outskirts of the playa, while   also  for its     lineup of DJs. ’ ’   Sometime during or after the group’’s famous ”white party,”   where ravers dress in all white, vandals entered the   camp. They allegedly pulled and cut electric lines, causing   food to spoil, stole personal belongings, glued trailer   doors shut, and flooded the camp with 200 gallons of potable   water,  reported. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   White Ocean wrote on Facebook that after notifying Burning Man   organizers of the incident, they were told, ”it makes sense that   you have been sabotaged as you are a closed camp and not   welcoming.” Burning Man has a contentious relationship with these      camps, as they create an  while also bringing top artists to   the desert. ’ ”   The   over at White Ocean don’t see it that way. ” ’   ”We provide one of the most state of the art stages on the playa   and feed hundreds of non white ocean [sic] burners a day. Does   this qualify as a non welcoming camp with no contribution to   Burning Man?” Thursday’’s post read. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
