Police have hit back at a man who taunted them over Facebook by announcing his arrest on their Facebook page. [Sergio Batchelor, who was wanted by police on charges of multiple burglaries, had taunted police whilst on the run by posting a message on his Facebook saying he was going to turn himself in to the “weak ass investigators,” letting them know that he was at “home if y’all want me. ”  A fugitive search team consequently found Batchelor at his home in DeKalb county after a month searching for him. They later found evidence at the property which suggested he had been involved in a burglary the night before his arrest. The police posted a photo of Batchelor on the Rockdale County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page, saying that if you “mess with the bull, you get the horns. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
