A new report on the   “Islamophobia Network” has been released, authored by the Council on   Relations (CAIR) and the leader of American Muslims for Palestine  —   two groups with ties to Hamas financiers and a vivid history of extremism, slander and deception. [This article originally appeared at The Clarion Project:  Here are three facts about the authors: 1. Both are linked to Hamas financiers based on prosecutions by the U. S. government. The Council on   Relations (CAIR) as explained in our factsheet, has a history of Islamist extremism including links to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, the Justice Department labeled CAIR an “unindicted  ” in a   trial and listed CAIR as a U. S. Muslim Brotherhood entity. More specifically, CAIR was listed by the Justice Department as a part of the Brotherhood’s covert “Palestine Committee” to support Hamas in the United States. The other official author is the University of   Center for Race and Gender. If you look more closely, you’ll see that the responsible section of the center is the Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project. So, who was the real author from the University’s staff? The aforementioned project is led by Dr. Hatem Bazian, chairman ofAmerican Muslims for Palestine (AMP)   of Zaytuna College and   of Students for Justice in Palestine.
