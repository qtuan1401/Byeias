Former Texas Governor Rick Perry is set to lead a   Cruz super Political Action Committee (PAC) called “Keep the Promise to Veterans. ”[Perry will recruit veterans to the Super PAC, which will help bring attention to the issues affecting veterans in America.  According to Bloomberg: Among those who will be joining Perry, Walt said, are the decorated former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell Dakota Meyer, a Marine Corps veteran and Medal of Honor recipient and Taya Kyle, the widow of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. The family of Dallas billionaire Darwin Deason has held talks about funding the new group, according to two people with knowledge of these discussions who asked for anonymity, but no decision has been made. Walt said planning for the group’s activities is at an early stage and it’s not clear how much money the organizers will seek to raise. Deason was one of Perry’s top donors, contributing $5 million to a   supporting the former governor’s presidential bid last year. Almost $4. 9 million of that amount was returned to him after Perry withdrew from the race. Last month, Deason’s son, Doug, held an informational session for potential Cruz donors during a California retreat organized by the billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David. In an   Thursday, Doug Deason declined to comment on the new group. Perry dropped out of the Republican presidential race last September. He has been serving as a surrogate for Cruz since he endorsed the Texas senator back in January.
