Sen. Marco Rubio is planning to meet with his former political mentor Jeb Bush to try to bury the hatchet, the Florida Senator says. [Speaking to reporters in Nevada today, Rubio said that he spoke with Bush on Monday and had “a nice conversation,” according to the New York Times.  “He’s just decompressing from this election,” Rubio told reporters. “And trying to get going again in the rest of his life. But we’ll meet and talk soon enough. ” Rubio did not specify a date for the meeting and told the Times that he had not asked for Bush’s endorsement. “We’re going to get together soon,” he said. After beating Bush soundly in South Carolina, Rubio was careful to praise the third member of the Bush family to run for president after he announced he would drop out of the race. “I have an incredible affection and admiration not just for Governor Bush but for his family and for their service to our country,” he said during his speech. “Jeb Bush has many things to be proud of. He is an extraordinary husband. He’s an extraordinary father. He was the greatest governor in the history of Florida. ”
