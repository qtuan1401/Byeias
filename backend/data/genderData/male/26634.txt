Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends Weekend,” Jim Hanson, the executive vice president at Center for Security Policy, discussed the Orlando shooting at a nightclub that resulted in the deaths of 50 people and injuring 53 others. The shooter was identified as    Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, FL, the son of Afghan parents.  Mateen’s attack is believed to have been inspired by ISIS. Hanson said was whether or not it was ISIS, it was important to note the shooting followed the tenets of Shariah law when comes to homosexuality. He pointed to other places around the world where Islamic nations enforce this belief. “Whether or not it’s ISIS, this was completely in keeping with totalitarian Islamic code called Shariah,” Hanson said. “The penalty for homosexuality under that law is death and this is not a theoretical thing. It is enforced. They’re throwing gays off buildings in Iran. They’re hanging gay people from cranes and now they’re slaughtering them in night clubs here in the United States. That’s what we’re dealing with. It’s not a tiny minority as President Obama would have you believe. More than half of Muslims worldwide believe that this barbaric code should be the law of the world and that we all should be subject to it. It’s horrific. ” Hanson added this should make some “give pause” to those coming to the country and not assimilating to the culture. “This is what the prescribed code says and even here in the United States, more than half of the Muslims believe that Shariah Law should supplant the U. S. Constitution,” he added. “Now that doesn’t mean all of them believe you should slaughter gays, but it should give people pause to wonder what people believe who are not assimilating to our culture. ” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
