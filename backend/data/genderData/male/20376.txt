A man has been arrested and charged with twenty counts of voyeurism for hiding cameras in a bathroom and locker room on the campus of Indiana State University (ISU). [A court has slapped Nick Pledger, 22, with twenty counts of voyeurism after police charged him with hiding the cameras, as well as taking up skirt shots of women on campus. The Vigo Superior Court also ordered the suspect to stay off the campus and granted a no contact order for ISU and the victims requested by Deputy Prosecutor Raeanna Moore.  An investigation based on tips to ISU police was launched into Pledger stemming from incidents beginning in 2015. The tipster reported that videos of women taken in the ISU locker room and other areas of the school ended up online. Officials discovered that Pledger gained access to the women’s locker room when his wife, a former ISU volleyball player, gave him the entrance code. Other videos showed scenes taking in the school’s Student Rec Center, the swimming pool, and a hot tub area. After the allegations and arrest, Pledger was released from the ROTC program and expelled from the university. The suspect’s trial date has been set for October 24, and he has been released on his own recognizance until that date.
