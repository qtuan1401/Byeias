’  ’ ”   Hong Kong’s latest rebound could end up being just a blip. ” ’   On Friday the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department  that the economy grew by 1. 6% in the second quarter. ’ ”   This was above economists’ expectations of 0. 5% according to the   Bloomberg consensus, and followed a contraction of 0. 5% in the   first quarter. ” ’   Going by only those numbers, this looks pretty good. ’ ”   The ongoing downturn in the city’s housing sector, however, has   economists feeling cautious. ” ’   ”Looking ahead, we expect growth to slow in the coming quarters,”   Capital Economics China economist Chang Liu argued. ”The ongoing   downturn in Hong Kong’’s property sector, which has looked frothy   for some time, is set to be a major headwind.” ’ ’   Home prices in Hong Kong have fallen by about 10% since their   September peak, according to data cited by Capital Economics. ’ ”     prices had been increasing for years until   affordability reached its   low in August. Prices started   dropping after that, which was then followed by a period of   slowing growth and consumption as homeowners’ properties lost   value. ” ’  ’ ’   Back in late June, BMI Research analysts argued that prices would   most likely keep falling in the near future, which could lead to   reverberations in the   and construction   sectors. And Liu expressed a similar sentiment. ’ ’   ”With interest rates in Hong Kong  —   which track those in the US   due to the city’’s peg to the dollar  —   set to rise further over   the next couple of years, there are good reasons to think that   house prices in Hong Kong have further to fall,” Liu said. ’ ’   ”Declining property prices will continue to drag on consumption   and construction in coming quarters,” she continued. ”It is   noticeable that consumption growth weakened in      terms last quarter while investment continued to contract.” ’ ’   Plus, she added, service exports are likely to feel the effects   of less spending by Chinese tourists. ’
