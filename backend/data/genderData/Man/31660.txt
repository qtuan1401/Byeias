The attack happened in the southwestern city of Pingxiang in the province of Guangxi. A    suspect has been caught, but his motives remain unclear, state media reported. Knife attacks at schools in China are common. Last year, a man in the southern province of Hainan stabbed 10 children before killing himself, authorities said.  And another man killed three students at a school in 2014 before jumping off a building. 2012: China attack illustrates U. S. gun law divide, But perhaps the worst spate of stabbings occurred in 2010, which included a period of three consecutive days in which attackers targeted schools. Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Education responded to those events by ordering schools to beef up security and bar strangers from going on campuses. Police in Beijing distributed long poles with prongs that security guards could use to keep attackers at bay.  China also began requiring people to register with the government when buying large knives.
