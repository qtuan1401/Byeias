What originally seemed an isolated group of 100 small earthquakes on New Year’s Eve has now grown to “more than 250 earthquakes,” and apprehension is running high. [On January 1 Breitbart News reported 100 earthquakes hit in the area of Brawley, CA. ABC 7 reported that the largest of the quakes was about 3. 9 magnitude. They also reported that scientists said larger quakes in the region were possible, and that “the shaking [could] continue for several days. ”  Seismologist Lucy Jones said there was an outbreak of quakes in the same region in 2012, and that the 2012 outbreak was larger.

But the additional 150 quakes since Saturday have people on edge, including some scientists. CBS San Francisco reports that the movement and shifting related to the quakes is now concerning. Scientists say the “seismically active” area “is the region that connects the San Andreas and Imperial faults,” and that “both faults can produce devastating earthquakes. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.
