’  ’ ’   Michael Phelps was back in the Olympic pool on Wednesday to   continue his quest for more gold medals, and he came out with an   extra piece of equipment  —   a piece of tape on top of his   headphones. ’ ’   On Sunday, Day 2 of the Rio Olympics, he came out wearing Beats   headphones with some   American flag tape. While it   is not unusual to see athletes with the logos covered with tape   at events where Beats is not an official partner, there was   something different about Phelps, as he did a lackluster job. ’ ’   While the side logos were covered in the tape, there was still a   very noticeable Beats wordmark on top of the headphones. Suddenly   the tape seemed like a failed attempt to stamp out what some   refer to as ”ambush marketing”  —   having athletes promote brands   that are not official partners of the Olympics. ’ ’  ’ ’   On Tuesday, the wordmark was still not covered. But on Wednesday,   somebody with the International Olympic Committee must have   finally noticed. ’ ’   When Phelps came out for the 200 individual medley semifinal, he   had a noticeable piece of American flag tape covering the Beats   wordmark on top. ’ ’  ’ ”   And it wasn’t just Phelps. Fellow American Ryan Lochte also had   some fresh tape on top of his headphones. ” ’  ’ ”   This isn’t the first time that Beats has caused some controversy   with athletes at the Olympics. In 2012, Beats gave many     Olympians free headphones before the Summer Olympics   in London. ” ’   Many athletes, including Phelps, were seen wearing the headphones   despite efforts by the IOC to prevent ambush marketing. ’
