An actress who promised to perform sex acts on Italians who voted “No” in the country’s referendum on Sunday will apparently make good on her word. [Italian actress Paola Saulino, 27, has posted a set of “tour” dates throughout Italy for the month of January in which she will reportedly keep her word to perform a sex act on “No” voters.  Italy voted decisively Sunday to reject changes to its Constitution in what was a victory for populists and a staggering blow to the European Union, and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned immediately following the vote. Saulino, who lists her current address in Los Angeles, has nicknamed her tour the “Pompa Tour. ” According to the UK Sun, “pompa” means “pump” in Italian and is also a slang term for oral sex. In a post to her Facebook page over the weekend, Saulino said she would visit a number of cities in Italy, including Rome, Venice and Milan, to make good on her promise. The poster for the tour features the actress posing suggestively while licking a lollipop. In a racy post last month, the actress maintained that she was serious about honoring her promise. “I’m not kidding I just want to thank you in my personal way,” Saulino wrote. The actress’s Facebook post says interested parties must fill out a “booking form” to be considered to met with her. Saulino’s promise is reminiscent of U. S. pop star Madonna’s offer of oral sex for those who voted for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the country’s presidential election. The singer did not ultimately follow through with her promise. The Euro plunged to its lowest level since March 2015 following Sunday’s referendum. As Breitbart News previously reported, the change would have shifted power in Italy’s Senate and concentrated more power in its parliament. The “No” vote was expected to provide a boost to the populist Five Star Movement and its leader, Beppe Grillo.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
