Sen. Marco Rubio welcomed Fox News host Megyn Kelly to join him on stage at a rally with supporters in Hialeah, Florida today Wednesday. [During the rally, Rubio first took the stage with his wife and began speaking fluent Spanish to supporters in the audience for about tenminutes. He warned of the “dirty tricks” played by his opponents, who kept hinting that he would drop out of the race before Florida.  “I will be on that ballot on Tuesday, I will campaign as long and as hard as it takes. We are going to the White House! We are going to win this nomination. ” Rubio said. Rubio encouraged all of his supporters to take advantage of early voting in advance of the primary. At the end of the rally, he introduced Megyn Kelly, who joined him on stage to tape an interview for Fox News immediately following his event. The interview is expected to air at 11:00 p. m. EST.  “Hi there,” Kelly said as she took the stage and waved to the crowd. “Welcome to Hialeah!” some in the crowd shouted while the pair stood on the stage. Later Rubio and Kelly acknowledged they were both wearing red before stepping out of the camera while the producer prepared for the interview. Fox News is interviewing all of the Republican candidates this evening to discuss the presidential campaign in advance of the CNN debate tomorrow. After taking their seats, Kelly explained that she wanted the atmosphere of the interview to be something between church and a Miami Heat game. Kelly interviewed Cruz earlier for a town hall feature tonight on Fox News.
