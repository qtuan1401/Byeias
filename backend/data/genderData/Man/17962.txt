The Huffington Post has found out that hard way that speaking on behalf of one half of the human population isn’t a simple task. [Yesterday, the Huffington Post waded into the row over Twitter’s cataclysmic   of Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos. The famously   site ran an article bearing the title “Thank You Twitter  —   By Unverifying Milo Yiannopoulos, You Are Standing Up For Women Online. ”  In the tediously common manner of the   left, the author, Jessie Thompson, presumes to speak on behalf of all women. Thomspon welcomed Twitter’s punishment, arguing that the internet was a “cesspit of misogyny,” and a “scary place to be a woman. ” Anticipating severe cyberviolence from Yiannopoulos’ followers Thomspon concludes the piece by announcing she is going to “make a cup of tea before they pile in. ” The trouble with speaking on behalf of half the human population, of course, is that not all of them will be inclined to agree with your opinion. Especially if it’s a quintessential example of   feminism. @jessiecath @Nero Banning faux feminists like U would be a better step.
