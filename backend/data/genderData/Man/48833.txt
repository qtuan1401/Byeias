’  ’ ’   The hedge fund world is a little like a dog   show.     Breeds are distinct, and judged separately from each other: you   can be a macro guy, a fundamental type, a quant.    And like with dog breeds, certain kinds of funds can   come in and out of fashion. Occasionally, a     emerges that captures the imagination and becomes the latest   fad.     These days, the new hybrid breed everyone is into is something   called ”quantamentals.”    And yes, like a cockapoo, not everyone is fond of this name,   either.  ’ ”   Quantamental managers combine the       skills of fundamental investors with the use   of computing power and big data sets to test their   hypotheses. For example, while a look at financial   statements and a visit to a retailer’s outlets might   help predict future profits or ability to repay its debt,   a portfolio manager could also test a theory   with algorithms that crunch through data on millions of   credit card accounts. ” ’   ”Big data and quantitative analysis can help identify   those items, but so can, and so will, fundamental   security analysis,” Steve Einhorn, vice chairman at Omega   Advisors, told Business Insider last month. ”There will   always be, in my opinion, an important place for the   traditional analyst and portfolio manager, but over time it   will certainly be complemented by these quantitative   approaches.” ’ ”   (Einhorn’s comments . Einhorn hasn’t been accused of   any wrongdoing).  ” ’   Quantamental investing has been driven in part by the rise of     alternative data. Fund managers can now study   everything from    or sentiment around a new movie, to   the. ’ ’  ’ ”   The amount of data sources doesn’t stop there; it’s endless, with   new possibilities coming out all the time, and making the   constant influx unlikely to become commoditized.  ” ”   That said, a lot of the new data doesn’t have a long   history or enough info points that computers   alone can draw from. ” ’   While that may hurt pure quant strategies, those that use a human   element to parse through the info will have better luck, some   say. ’ ’   ”The main skillset that human can bring to the table, which   quantitative trading strategies can’’t really perform, is the   ability to reason based on small datasets,” Manoj Narang said at   The Trading Show conference in New York on Thursday. ’ ’   Narang, who made his name in high speed trading before   launching hedge fund firm Mana Partners, called the mix of   quant and discretionary strategies ”one of the most   exciting growth areas.” ’ ”   Even if 10 analysts were to parse through the same datasets,   they’d all come up with different predictions based on it,   according to Gene Ekster, who advises hedge funds on how to use   the fresh data, and believes he was the first to coin the term   . ” ’   ”Your kings of the universe are no longer the folks wearing suits   and going to galas. It’s the folks that are crunching Python [a   programming language] and going to meet ups,” Ekster said. ”These   are becoming the new masters of the universe.”   ’ ’   Getting the staffers to crunch through the numbers is one thing  —     sometimes this requires data scientists who command a premium   salary. Gathering the data is another, and grows more expensive   depending on how niche the request. ’ ’  ’ ”   At the same time, there’s a disconnect for the types of people   needed for these jobs and the applicants in the market. Quants  —     those that use   models to trade  —   have become a   hot commodity in the hedge fund world, recruiters say.        And some legendary hedge funders, like Paul Tudor Jones and Steve   Cohen, .     Business schools haven’t caught on yet as much as needed. ” ’   ”Data scientists and computer science students are learning data   science but not about Wall Street or investing,” said   Michael Gantcher, head of sales at RS Metrics, which sells data   based on satellite and aerial photograph, among other things. ’ ’  ’ ”   At Steve Cohen’s multibillion shop, Point72 Asset Management,   recent recruits are getting schooled in programming   alongside fundamental stock picking. Older analysts are   getting classes on data science and stats that they can weave   into traditional financial modeling, Matthew   Granade,  ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’not going to have a person on   top of this who is a whiz at programming and a whiz at Excel   modeling,” he said. ”But I do think in the timeline we’’re   talking about, they can have a deep appreciation of company   fundamentals coupled with an understanding of how this data   works and how statistics work and how to think of all these   data sets.” ’ ”   Ekster, the hedge fund consultant, said he was recently contacted   by a University of Michigan professor looking to revamp the   curriculum, a sign of a slowly shifting tide. For the   analysts at the fundamental hedge funds, it’ll mean doing   the same job and learning how to weave in the fresh data into   models. ” ’   ”I wouldn’’t say that it’’s taking away from the fundamental   approach,” added Erik Haines, director of data and analytics at   Guidepoint, which provides funds with data. ”It’s just becoming   another tool within the toolkit.”  ’
