From Katty Kay writing at the BBC:  George Washington was elected president of a newly independent America in 1789.   men later (41 of them white) Hillary Clinton makes history by being the first female nominee for the White House. So why don’t I feel more excited? Let’s put politics aside for a moment. Whatever your political leanings, this is by any measure a momentous day for women. Mrs Clinton could become Madame President. We’ve never had a woman hold the most powerful job in the world before. If you believe that we are all better off when more women take up senior positions, in politics as much as business or journalism or law or medicine or the military, then it’s significant that we’ve never had a woman run America. Whether you love her or hate her, whether she were Republican, Democrat, liberal or conservative, she is a she and that’s a big deal in and of itself. It is of course not reason enough to vote for her in November. But it is reason enough to pause to reflect on this moment. Read the rest of the story at the BBC.
