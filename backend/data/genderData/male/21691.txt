Not satisfied with just losing gobs of money on each car that Tesla builds, CEO Elon Musk just revealed his “Master Plan” to “try to take over the world”  —   a plan that seemed so farfetched, the stock crashed by 3. 5 percent[The grandiosity of Musk’s latest pronouncements sounds like an episode from Steven Spielberg’s Pinky and the Brain, about two genetically enhanced laboratory mice that reside in a cage in the Acme Labs research center. With Brain as an egotistical genius and Pinky is    incompetent, each shows featured the “Brain” scheming to “try to take over the world,” which ultimately fails due to the impossibility of Brain’s plan.  Unveiling what Elon Musk calls “Master Plan, Part Deux” to “guide the company into the next decade,” he promised to extend its electric vehicle range to “cover the major forms of terrestrial transport,” by merging energy and transportation with 7 key elements: Analysts are skeptical about Tesla’s ability to add even more products to its lineup, given its history of product delays and cash burn.
