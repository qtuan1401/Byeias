Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “The O’Reilly Factor,” network personality Geraldo Rivera announced he was withdrawing his opposition to a border.  Rivera, who has had some heated   on O’Reilly’s show over the past decade on the issue of immigration, acknowledged that elections have consequences, therefore he doesn’t oppose the wall  —   despite thinking it was a waste of money. “I’m going to shock you. I am withdrawing my opposition to the wall,” Rivera said. “No, listen, elections have consequences. This was his signature issue, and if the people want the wall, which I think is a waste of money. ” “Geraldo is down with the wall now,” O’Reilly replied. “And you know, I think you should have a piece full wall   …     sponsored by Geraldo. You could have your picture there. “You’re going to have a $  wall and a $25 ladder and the ladder will triumph,” Rivera added. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
