’To demonstrate a basic property of physics, Norwegian physicist Andreas Wahl tied himself to the side of building 45 feet off the ground:’ ’The only thing keeping him from falling and potentially breaking a body part, or several, was a cable with a weight attached to the end.’ ’At first, the weight was secured to the building.’ ”But then a few of Wahl’s colleagues released the weight and Wahl immediately began to plummet to the ground:” ’’ ”When Wahl’s colleagues released the weight, both he and it started to fall. Wahl fell straight under the force of gravity, but the weight  —   because it was placed at a distance from Wahl  —   traced an arc through the air, just like a swinging pendulum.” ’The weight underwent what Isaac Newton first described in the 17th century as centripetal force  —   the force that makes a body follow a curved path. In this case, the force was the tension from the cable.’ ’As the force of gravity pulled the weight down, tension from the cable pulled it toward a central point  —   the pipe. This induced an arc, which you can see below:’ ’’ ”After a couple of turns, the cable has wrapped around the pipe enough to stop Wahl’s fall just a few feet above the ground.” ’’ ”Therefore, don’t try this at home. Leave this sort of thing to the physicists.” ’Watch all the action on  or below:’ ’’
