For   travelers, flying business or first class is increasingly within the realm of possibility. Prices for these seats are lower than in the past, said George Hobica, the founder of the air travel advice site airfarewatchdog. com. “Airlines used to upgrade passengers to first or business class for free,” he said, “but they’ve stopped doing that and are instead making these tickets more affordable and attainable. ” Here, he shares his tips on how to snag a seat in these premium cabins without paying premium prices. BUY DIRECT The airlines themselves, as opposed to   airfare ticket sites such as Expedia. com, usually have the best prices for their   and   tickets, Mr. Hobica said.
