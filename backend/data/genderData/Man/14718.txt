DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  —   Tiger Woods withdrew from the Dubai Desert Classic on Friday with back spasms after shooting an   77 a day earlier. [Woods’ manager, Mark Steinberg, said Woods suffered from spasms on Thursday night after dinner.  “Tiger Woods went into a spasm in his lower back fairly late last night   …     got treatment done early this morning for 3   hours, but can’t get it out. ” “He says it’s not the nerve, but back spasm, and he can’t get the spasms to calm down. He can move around, but he can’t make a full rotation in his swing. ” Woods made a comeback after multiple back surgeries after a   layoff, and was expected to play four times in five weeks, starting from last week’s Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines, where he missed the cut. The European Tour, without giving a reason, announced his withdrawal on Friday before Woods began his second round at Dubai. After Woods’ opening round, he said “I wasn’t in pain at all   …     I was just trying to hit shots and I wasn’t doing a very good job. ”
