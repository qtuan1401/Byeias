Tiger Woods does not know when he returns to the PGA Tour. He does know that he never again returns to his old training regimen. [“I’m one of those guys who used to hit a lot of golf balls, used to sometimes practice eight, ten, twelve hours a day,” Woods told reporters Monday morning. “That won’t happen again. I won’t be running five, six miles a day like I used to. That’s not happening, either. ”  He spoke at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, at an event promoting the Quicken Loans National. There, he dumped several practice shots into the water that preceded the green. Woods last competed in a tournament late last summer at the Wyndham Championship. The   ’s back continues to bother him. Woods says he is “progressing” but neither he nor his doctors can firmly say when he comes back. “On a serious note, I have been practicing at home. I’m progressing nicely. I’m hoping to play [the Quicken Loans National]. I don’t know that I’m going to play. That’s the overriding question I keep hearing: ‘When are you coming back? When are you playing? ‘ I get it all the time. If I knew, I’d tell you. “It’d would be fun to know. It’d be nice to know I’m going to play on such and such a date, but I don’t know. ”
