FBI director James Comey debunked Hillary Clinton’s claim that Comey called her “truthful” about her private email scandal. [“I did not,” Comey confirmed Wednesday at a U. S. House hearing, making it clear that Clinton was not being truthful when she made her comment about Comey calling her “truthful. ”  “I never say that about anybody,” Comey added. “Our business is never to decide whether we believe someone. Our business is always to decide what evidence do we have that would convince us not to believe that person. It’s an odd way to look at the world, but it’s how investigators look at the world. ”
