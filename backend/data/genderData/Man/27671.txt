Alleged gunman Jason Brian Dalton blames the February 20 Kalamaazoo shooting spree on an Uber smartphone app for drivers, which he says took control of him like “artificial intelligence that can tap into your body. ”  According to the police report filed on the shootings that killed six, Dalton told police “he is not a killer and he knows that he has killed. ” He said the Uber app “has the ability to take you over” and that “it feels like it is coming from the phone itself. ” He told police “he really did not know how to describe that. ” Dalton told the officers that his alleged actions were inexplicable to him, and that is why he kept talking about an “artificial presence. ” He said he did not have a concealed pistol permit and did not normally even carry a gun that he “kept his guns locked up at home. ” He also told officers he had his dog with him as he drove around on February 20  —   and allegedly even took the animal to a dog park at some point. ClickOnDetroit reports that Dalton told police that color changes on the Uber app screen are what set him off. He said “that when the app changed from red to black that is when he started having problems. ” At one point, Dalton said he thought the app wanted him to have a shootout with police, but the colors changed from black back to red and “he stopped his thought. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
