The Obama Administration is on pace to issue more than a million green cards to migrants from   countries, according to an analysis of Department of Homeland Security data. [A chart released by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest Friday details the surge in immigration to the U. S. from   countries since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.  Specifically, in the first six fiscal years of Obama’s presidency (FY2009  —   FY2014) his administration issued 832, 014 green cards to migrants   countries, the most of which were issued to migrants from Pakistan (102, 000) Iraq (102, 000) Bangladesh (90, 000) Iran (85, 000) Egypt (56, 000) and Somalia (37, 000). The total 832, 014 new permanent residents do not include migrants on temporary, nonimmigrant visas  —   which allow foreign nationals to come to the U. S. temporarily for work, study, tourism and the like. As the subcommittee notes, the number also does not include those migrants who overstayed the terms of their visas.  Regardless, as the subcommittee explained in its analysis, the U. S. is playing host to immigrants from majority Muslim countries at an increasing pace. Between FY 2013 and FY 2014, the number of green cards issued to migrants from   countries increased dramatically  —   from 117, 423 in FY 2013, to 148, 810 in FY 2014, a nearly 27 percent increase. Throughout the Obama Administration’s tenure, the United States has issued green cards to an average of 138, 669 migrants from   countries per year, meaning that it is nearly certain the United States will have issued green cards to at least 1. 1 million migrants from   countries on the President’s watch. It has also been reported that migration from   countries represents the fastest growing class of migrants. Green cards, or Lawful Permanent Residency, puts immigrants on the path to citizenship and allows for lifetime residency, federal benefits, and work authorization. Included in the totals are refugees, who are required to apply for a green card after one year of residency in the U. S. Unlike other types of immigrants, refugees are immediately eligible for welfare benefits including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) food stamps, and Medicaid. A report from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) indicated that in FY 2013, 91. 4 percent of Middle Eastern refugees (accepted to the U. S. between  ) received food stamps, 73. 1 percent were on Medicaid or Refugee Medical Assistance and 68. 3 percent were on cash welfare.
