A group on a Delta flight going from Tampa to Los Angeles was treated to a Kenny G performance Saturday morning.  Per ABC Action News, the person sitting next to the   saxophonist was an   flight attendant whose daughter had died of brain cancer. She asked Kenny G to play. The head flight attendant then told passengers that Kenny G would play for them if they donated $1, 000 to cancer charity Relay for Life. Passengers rose to the challenge and then some, raising about $2, 000. Kenny G lived up to his promise, performing while walking up and down the aisle. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
