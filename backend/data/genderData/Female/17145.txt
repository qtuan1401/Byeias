Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos has received multiple threats from Muslim Twitter users following his recent condemnation of the Islamic religion’s treatment of gays and women. [One user, @MohDiary, called for his 1. 2 million followers to vote for Islam on Milos recent poll questioning what it is America wants: Women, gays and freedom or Islam.  رجع رجع خلونا نكمل التصويت,  —   mohammeDiary+ (@I_mohdiary) June 15, 2016,  The user then said that his followers needed to keep voting once Milo was unsuspended from Twitter. Other users tweeted that they had made new Twitter accounts just to vote on the poll, a practice that goes specifically against Twitters Terms of Service. @I_mohdiary من كثر ما تحمست ودي اسوي حسابات جديده بس عشان اصوت 😂  —   shahad (@eiu21) June 15, 2016,  It was reported by one user that this tweet by @MohDiary called for the bombing of homosexuals at a Lady Gaga concert. @unspectateur @Nero ..

These are bot accounts usually purchased by Twitter users in an attempt to make themselves seem more popular and add credibility to their arguments.  It is also reported by the manager of Milos online store, Gabriel Massetti, that the store’s professional Twitter page received as many as 106 threatening DM’s today alone. The threats have not all been fully translated yet but what can be translated are phrases such as “we shut down your account” and “next we pray in your home. ”  It is also being reported that there has been multiple threats of bombings sent to the stores twitter page. Individual messages have not been posted but the @SwagByMilo page did post a screenshot of their Twitter DMs. We highly protect our customer’s privacy and information. However, we don’t protect terrorist’s information. pic. twitter.   —   SWAG by Milo (@swagbymilo) June 15, 2016,  A credit card scam was also discovered by the stores security system that noticed multiple stolen credit cards were being used to purchase items in an attempt to chargeback the money later, possibly costing the store thousands in revenue. Luckily the custom security measures implemented by Massetti caught and rejected all of these fake purchases avoiding a  huge crisis.  It’s no surprise that Milo is receiving threats via Twitter, in the real world Milos event at UCF was cancelled due to police being unable to ensure safety, if there’s possibility of Milo being targeted in real life, of course online threats would be quite common. It doesn’t seem as if the threats are going to stop any time soon as Milo’s twitter mentions seem to be filled with angry followers of the Muslim faith.
