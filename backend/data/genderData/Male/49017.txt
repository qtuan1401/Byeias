’  ’ ’   This past May, Anthony Bourdain shared a meal with President   Barack Obama in Hanoi, Vietnam  that premiered   in September. ’ ”   The scenario would have sounded like a joke to Bourdain 20 years   ago, when he was bouncing around New York City’s restaurant   scene, doing whatever he could to make it one day to the next. ” ’   Bourdain, 60, has documented in detail his adjustment to the   surrealness of the fame that hit him in his 40s with the huge   success of bestselling 2000 memoir ”” and the television series that followed, but    he   explained that only recently has he attained a level of inner   peace. ’ ’   ”I know the guy who wrote ’’Kitchen Confidential’’ very well,”   Bourdain said. ”He’’s not me anymore. I’’m not boiling with rage. I   don’’t live in this tiny,   world. I had such a   limited view of what reality was like outside of the kitchen   doors  —   I had no clue! I never lived with normal people. I lived   in the restaurant universe for my entire adult life.” ’ ’   A major turning point for Bourdain was the birth of his daughter   Ariane in 2007. ”I’’m no longer the star of the movie,” he said.   ”At all. That’’s it!” ’ ’’ ’   Setting aside his ego has also allowed him to pursue career   opportunities that he may have overanalyzed in the past, he   explained, such as being the spokesman for the Balvenie whiskey   company or appearing as a judge on ”Top Chef.” ’ ’   ”I work really hard to not ever think about my place in the   world,” he said. He continued: ’ ’   Bourdain said he’’s now driven by the desire to ”play in a   creative way” and ”not repeat” himself. ”I like making   things,” he said. ’
