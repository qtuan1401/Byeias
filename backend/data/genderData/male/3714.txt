The rest of the week, the beaches of Senegal are a haven for swimmers, sunbathers or anyone in the mood to relax under a   umbrella with some grilled shrimp and an orange Fanta. A number of beaches around Dakar, the capital, have also become wildly popular with surfers, chasing the bliss of the perfect wave captured in the 1966 documentary “The Endless Summer,” which was shot partly in Senegal. But on Sunday, it’s the sheep and horses’ turn. The warm Atlantic becomes a bathtub for the animals every Sunday, as shepherds line up their flocks on the sand for a daylong cleansing ritual. It’s a spiritual exercise and a way to spruce up the livestock. Senegal is predominantly Muslim, and sheep are prized as sacrifices during religious festivals some people believe the cleaner the animal, the better the sacrifice. Spa day for the sheep begins with their being led, almost always by men, into the ocean to soak for several minutes. Next, it’s back out of the waves for a thorough scrubbing on the shore with soap and a brush. The sheep take another dip to rinse off, and then it’s manicure time: cleaning out the hooves with a stick and trimming them with scissors. Each animal is taken back into the water for a final swim, then is tied to a nearby tree or beached fishing boat to wait for the rest of the flock to bathe. It’s easy for them to  : Senegalese sheep look more like goats than like the fluffy, woolly breeds common to the West. The same waters are also used to bathe the draft animals that pull horse carts, the pickup trucks of Senegal. The horses are led into the water up to their necks and then scrubbed down, becoming regular interlopers in the Sunday surfing classes at Dakar’s wide and crowded Yoff Beach.
