’  ’ ’   Ever wonder what an investment banker actually does? ’ ’   If you’’ve ever heard terms like ”IPO” or ”DCF” tossed   around without a clue as to what they mean  —   or speculated about     workweek horror stories and whether they could   possibly be true, listen up. ’ ’   Alan Li, a former Goldman Sachs junior banker who just wrapped up   his   analyst program, has launched a podcast to answer   all of your questions. ’ ’   Li, who worked in tech, media, and telecom banking in Goldman   Sachs’’ San Francisco office, says he created his podcast,   ”The Vampire Squid,” to address a ”lack of transparency” around   finance. ’ ”   It’s targeted at people who don’t work in the industry. So far,   the podcast has addressed questions like what investment banking   means, what an average day on the Street looked like for him, and   what the dress code was in San Francisco and New York. ” ’’ ’   Li named the podcast after the infamous  referring to Goldman Sachs as a   ”vampire squid . .. relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into   anything that smells like money.” But, he says, the goal is to   dispel rumors and myths around the industry. ’ ’   ”I dug into what a vampire squid is and it turns out they don’’t   suck blood at all  —   it’’s just a name for how they look,” Li   explained in the first episode. ”So hopefully there is a parallel   there and after listening to this podcast you won’’t view finance   in general as this   animal.” ’ ’   The first few episodes include an introduction to Li and the   podcast, an overview of investment banking, and a detailed look   at the initial public offering process. Next up will be an   episode debunking Wall Street jargon and explaining different   types of financial statements. ’ ’   You can find the podcast  or on iTunes . ’
