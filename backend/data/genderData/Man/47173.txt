’’ ’Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos went to great lengths in his  to highlight the three big ”pillars” of his company: Amazon Web Services, Marketplace, and Prime.’ ”All three businesses have played a significant role in growing Amazon’s revenue, which topped $100 billion for the first time last year. But as big as those three businesses are, it’s equally important for Amazon to find the fourth pillar of the business that could eventually generate billions of dollars a year.” ’”While I’’ll focus on those three, I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth,” Bezos wrote in the letter.’ ”It’s hard to predict where that fourth pillar will come from. Some think that it’ll be  while some expect its   service to take off.” ”But according to RBC Capital’s Mark Mahaney, these are the three areas most likely to become Amazon’s next growth drivers: shipping, business supplies, and groceries.” ”Mahaney notes that he picked them based on market size, market efficiency, Amazon’s competencies, and signs of traction by Amazon. Here’s a summary of his thinking:” ”1. Shipping: Mahaney sees the   market to be about $200 billion in size, the smallest among the three. But he still believes that’s a   opportunity for Amazon to invest in, and an area that needs improvements given the shipment delays it experienced in recent holiday seasons. Plus, having a stronger logistics network will only bolster the customer experience.” ”Mahaney believes that Amazon already has the capacity and scale to build up its own logistics network, and it’s only a matter of time before it bulks up its shipping business.” ’”Shipping as a Fourth Pillar for Amazon will be either an obvious option or an obvious reality,” he writes.’ ’2.
