CHEROKEE, Iowa —   “The truth about Hillary Clinton and the truth about Bill Clinton will naturally come out throughout the course of the democratic process,” Sen. Ted Cruz told Breitbart News in an interview on his   bus tour through Iowa. [Cruz told Breitbart News that he doesn’t want to launch personal attacks against Hillary and Bill Clinton’s history with women during Mr. Clinton’s time in office from 1993 to 2001, but does believe that the democratic process will reveal the truth about their history.  “I believe at the end of the day, truth will prevail,” Cruz said. “For the last seven years women have done much, much worse under the   economy. The policies that Hillary Clinton advocates have proven to be a manifest disaster for Americans across the country, but for women in particular. We have seen millions of women enter poverty under Barack Obama. ”
