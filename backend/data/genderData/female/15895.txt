A Islamic preacher who has referred to   as “kuffar” and preached on how to kill homosexuals is due to deliver a set of nightly lectures at an Iranian   organisation in London, Breitbart London can reveal. [Shaykh Hamza Sodagar  —   who gained notoriety earlier this year for his lecture on “one of five” ways to kill homosexuals  —   is due to speak at the Islamic Republic of Iran School in   London between October 4th  —   12th.  According to a speaker biography, Mr. Sodagar regards himself as a “role model” for “young Muslims all around the world”. A recent video of the preacher features Mr. Sodagar stating: “If there’s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things. One  —   the easiest one maybe  —   chop their head off, that’s the easiest. Second  —   burn them to death. Third  —   throw ’em off a cliff. Fourth  —   tear down a wall on them so they die under that. Fifth  —   a combination of the above”.  As noted in 2014, he has also claimed Europeans and Americans are controlled by a “Zionist web of media is trying to control the minds of the people”. The event is being organised by a group called the Ahlulbayt Islamic Mission, which also hosted Mr. Sodagar in 2014. The Stand for Peace organisation notes that Ahlulbayt is a   regime group. The group advertises “tours” of Iraq and Iran on its website, as well as organising “swimming for brothers”  —   swimming events catering solely for men and children  —   at a local pool in north London.
