From Jonathan Swan writing at The Hill:  Hillary Clinton made sweeping promises about transparency at her family’s foundation before she was confirmed in 2009 as President Obama’s secretary of State. At the time, Clinton was under pressure from senators in both parties and even the White House to agree to be transparent given the potential for ethical concerns with the Clinton Foundation, which has accepted donations or entered into charitable partnerships with foreign and corporate interests. During her confirmation hearing, the Clinton Foundation was mentioned 62 times as senators worried that foreign governments could use donations to the foundation to curry favor with the Clinton State Department. Clinton said at the hearing that “all contributors will be disclosed,” and pointed to a memorandum of understanding   in December 2008 between the foundation and the transition team of then   Barack Obama that pledged unprecedented transparency into her family’s sprawling organization.
