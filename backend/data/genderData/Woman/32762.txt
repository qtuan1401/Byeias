 (CNN) Here’s some background information about earthquakes worldwide.  The US Geological Survey describes an earthquake as ”the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault. Stresses in the earth’s outer layer push the sides of the fault together. Stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth’s crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.”  Major Earthquakes since 2000:(selected timeline of earthquakes around the world with death tolls exceeding 100) June 4, 2000   A magnitude 7. 9 earthquake strikes southern Sumatra, Indonesia, killing an estimated 103 people.

After a seismograph recorded the amplitude of waves during an earthquake, Richter used a logarithm to determine the magnitude of the quake. Each whole number increase on the scale, say from 5. 0 to 6. 0, represents a tenfold increase in amplitude and releases 32 times more energy.
