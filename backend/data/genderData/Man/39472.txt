 (CNN) Lawmakers are used to being interrupted when they’re speaking on the floor of the parliament. But not by their own neck tie.  Irish politician Aengus Ó Snodaigh was talking about the very important issue of workers exposed to asbestos when his festive neck tie started singing.  Ó Snodaigh never missed a beat, continuing his speech as the tie played ’Santa Claus is Coming to Town’ and ’We Wish you a Merry Christmas.’  Bewildered parliamentarians looked around to see where the music was coming from.  The red tie, with Santa Claus shimmying down toward a house, has a new owner, but no word from Ó Snodaigh on why he gave it away. ”Delighted with my new Christmas tie given to me by @aosnodaigh after making its Dail debut today,” posted fellow congressman, Jim Daly.
