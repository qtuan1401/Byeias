 (CNN) A second lawsuit has been filed against Caitlyn Jenner in connection with a fatal,   accident that happened in February on California’s Pacific Coast Highway. The personal injury suit was filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court by Jessica Marie Steindorff, a talent manager who works in Hollywood.  Steindorff was driving a 2010 Toyota Prius that was part of a   crash in Malibu on February 7. Her lawsuit claims that Jenner operated a vehicle ”negligently, carelessly, recklessly and wantonly” and caused the collision. It refers to Jenner as ”Bruce Jenner    Caitlyn Jenner” and seeks unspecified damages.   Steindorff’s Prius was stopped in traffic when it was   by a white Lexus, according to sheriff’s deputies. That Lexus was then   by Jenner’s black Cadillac Escalade SUV, which was towing a trailer with an   vehicle on it. The impact from Jenner’s vehicle propelled the white Lexus into traffic, where it collided with a black Hummer H2.  The driver of the white Lexus,    Kim Howe of Calabasas, California, died at the scene. Howe’s adult stepchildren have already filed a civil lawsuit against Jenner, seeking unspecified damages and the cost of the suit. In addition to the single fatality, five children and two adults were hospitalized with injuries from the accident, authorities said.  A deputy said Jenner voluntarily took a field sobriety test, was questioned and went home. Jenner passed the test, according to CNN affiliate KSBW. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said on its Facebook page that the surviving drivers were cooperating with investigators. Neither Jenner nor Steindorff’s attorney returned calls for comment. Jenner speaks out on crash: ’It is a devastating tragedy’
