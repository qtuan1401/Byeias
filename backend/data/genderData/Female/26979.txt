During the riots this weekend in Milwaukee, WI after the shooting death of an armed black man by a black police officer, surveillance video in a Metro PCS captured a group of people busting inside and stealing from the store.  A Fox 6 report says the looting happened at a Metro PCS on the north side of the city not long after a BP Gas Station was set on fire. In all, six businesses were damaged or destroyed from Saturday night into Sunday morning as a response to the shooting. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
