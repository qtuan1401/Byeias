’  ’ ”   Disruption is Silicon Valley’s favorite buzzword. And while the   forces of innovation and technology are hard to quantify, that’s   not stopping Bank of America Merrill Lynch from trying.  ” ’   The transportation sector in particular has $608 billion worth of   market share ripe for disruption from the     sharing economy, the bank said in a report. ’ ’   ”We are reaching “peak car” in many developed markets,” Bank of   America said. ”Transportation is costly and inefficient, making   the sector ripe for disruption.” ’ ”   On average, cars sit idle 95% of the time. That’s huge for a   country with 112 million registered vehicles. Freeing up those   dormant cars to be a part of the economy will take more than just   Uber.  ” ’   Specifically, the bank points to four other specific areas that   will add to the disruption: ’ ’   Cycling may seem unrelated to vehicle commuting, but 40% of car   trips are  (a roughly 20 minute bike ride). Bikes can also   bridge the ”final mile” gap between mass transit and a worker’’s   home or office.  ’ ’  ’ ”   Of course, entrenched enterprises aren’t going to go without a   fight. Jaguar Land Rover has  $25 million in Lyft and  on a   startup, just to   name a few. ” ’   ”Auto manufacturers and tech companies have been some of the   largest investors and movers on ” writes Bank of   America. ”For some actors, this is a financial hedge against the   disruptive potential of mobility services. For others, it   strategically leverages their area of expertise.” ’ ”Disruption is Silicon Valley’s favorite. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
