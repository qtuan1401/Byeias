Revenue is so small that the company isn’t sharing sales figures, though one estimate .” ”But there’s one guy who gets up every day thrilled about it: Apple COO Jeff Williams.” ”The longtime Apple executive was just promoted to chief operating officer last month. He’s the person in charge of the Apple Watch project, as well as Apple’s other   .” ’Williams did an interview with a syndicated radio show called  in which he talked about all the emails the company had been getting from people who say the Watch changed their lives  —   helping them lose weight, for instance.’ ’And he says Apple has gotten ”a ton of emails where people say the Watch actually saved their life,” he says.’ ’”The only thing on the Apple Watch from a medical standpoint is the   sensor,” he says.’ ’And while heart rate can be taken by a person’’s wrist pulse, ”having the information readily available and passively tracked in the background has proved to be profound in a way we didn’’t anticipate,” he adds.’ ’”We’’ve gotten so many emails where people or their cardiologist have written us and said, ’’This person detected something on their Watch and came in and they had a   situation. If we had not intervened, they probably would have died. ”’ ’Williams says Watch buyers can use their iPhones to track their heart rate throughout the day.’ ’Sometimes they notice something odd, such as ”a severe drop in blood pressure,” he says. ”The fact that it’’s monitored gives people a more continuous view, rather than a snapshot. ”’ ’’ ’’ ”We should point out that the Watch doesn’t stand alone in helping diagnose medical problems by tracking data. We know of a person who mentioned to her doctor that she used Fitbit to track sleep data. The doctor asked to look at the data and discovered that she had sleep apnea.”
