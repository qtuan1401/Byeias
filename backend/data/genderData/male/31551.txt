Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about President Obama’s visit to Hiroshima. [Bolton agreed that it was inappropriate for the President to declare his visit was meant to honor Imperial Japan’s war dead, as well as the Allied soldiers who died defeating the Axis.  Bolton said: I think the President’s other remarks, where he said the scientific revolution that brought us the splitting of the atom should have brought us a “moral revolution” as well, is a    veiled attack on Harry Truman, whose morals apparently didn’t quite make it up to Barack Obama’s high standards. “This is a typically subtle Obama speech in many respects, but, make no mistake, it is the next stage, maybe the last act, of his apology tour,” he added. He noted that mainstream media coverage of Obama’s Hiroshima visit has missed the point that Obama “simply does not believe that the exercise of American power leads to a more peaceful world. ” “He listed, in this speech, several causes of war,” said Bolton. “One of them that he did not list was   which was why we were in World War II to begin with. I think when you look at what he said overall, it’s a criticism of the United States. Maybe he doesn’t use the phrase ‘I apologize,’ but it’s certainly a confession of error, in his view. ” “Mr.   Obama doesn’t say what he would have done differently than what Harry Truman did, faced with the choice Harry Truman was faced with,” Bolton pointed out. “This is just typical of Obama. He lives in an ideological world that has little or nothing to do with American reality. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
