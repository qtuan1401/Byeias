The Clinton campaign is postponing a fundraiser in North Carolina for unexplained reasons, while Hillary Clinton remains absent from the campaign trail. [Hillary Clinton postponed a lunch fundraiser in Chapel Hill with some of the state’s wealthiest and most prominent Democrats.  No reason was given for postponement of the Clinton event, according to CBS North Carolina. It was expected to take place at the home of Betty Craven and Michael Warner. The event was billed as “lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton” and costs ranged from $2, 700 to $100, 000. A Clinton spokesman did not respond to a request from Breitbart News for comment. Clinton appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Monday night, but it was previously taped in New York City on Friday. Nothing else is on Hillary Clinton’s public campaign schedule for Tuesday, and she may be at home in Chappaqua, New York. Clinton has a rally scheduled for Wednesday in Orlando, Florida but no public events scheduled for Thursday or Friday. The first presidential debate takes place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Monday, September 26.
