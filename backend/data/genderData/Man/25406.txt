On MSNBC Saturday, former Ohio Democratic state senator Nina Turner, a national surrogate for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) reacted to the report that Sanders is set to visit the Vatican.  Turner hoped Sanders would get a chance to meet Pope Francis because “they are on the same page” when it comes to economic morality. “I hope that [Sen. Sanders] does get the opportunity to meet with the pope because as the senator has expressed, he and the pope are on the same page when you talk about morality, that economic morality,” Turner said.
