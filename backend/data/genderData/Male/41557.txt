 (CNN) Danny Jones, the Wales rugby league international, has passed away after suffering a suspected cardiac arrest during a game in London. The    who was married and a father of   old twins, collapsed during a contest on Sunday and was treated at the ground before being taken to the Royal Free Hospital. According to the Rugby Football League (RFL) Jones collapsed after being replaced in the opening stages of the match and was treated by the match doctor and paramedics at the scene. The match was abandoned after 16 minutes but extensive efforts to resuscitate Jones proved unsuccessful.  ”He was the life and soul in the dressing room, a natural leader, a true professional and irreplaceable,” read a statement issued by the player’s club, Keighley Cougars. ”He achieved over 1000 points and 150 appearances for Keighley Cougars and he will be sorely missed. We are devastated.” Jones is the second athlete in the past week to die after suspected heart problems after Gregory Mertens, the Belgian football player, failed to recover after collapsing during a reserve game. Jones, who was born in Halifax, played for his hometown club as well as Keighley during his   professional career. He made 12 appearances for Wales, making his debut in 2010 and helped his country win the European Championship Final against France in the same year. Jones played every game of the 2011 Four Nations and appeared in the 2013 World Cup. RFL Chief Operating Officer Ralph Rimmer said: ”It is always devastating when someone so young dies in these circumstances.  Danny was a popular and talented Rugby League player, having played at the highest level with the Wales National team and playing over 12 seasons for Keighley Cougars and Halifax.  ”The Rugby League community will mourn his loss and I wish to extend our deepest sympathies to Danny’s family and friends at this incredibly sad time.” Read: Why do sports stars collapse in action?
