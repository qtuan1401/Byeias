 (CNN) Police in Georgia were searching Saturday for a man suspected of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a    girl before leaving her in a parking lot on a busy road. Friday afternoon, police responded to a report of a child wandering alone near a strip mall in Stone Mountain, said DeKalb County police spokesman Maj. Stephen Fore.  The girl told police a stranger had taken her from her home at a nearby apartment complex and then left her in parking lot of the mall. Officers brought the child to a hospital for an evaluation, where health officials discovered she had been sexually assaulted, Fore said. While the child was in the officers’ custody, DeKalb County police received a call from the girl’s mother, reporting her daughter was missing from the apartment complex, according to Fore. It was the victim’s    brother who reported his sister had been kidnapped, police said. Police said they are looking for a   black male in his early 20s, with long hair tied into a ponytail and a long beard. He is believed to be driving an early 2000s gray Hyundai.
