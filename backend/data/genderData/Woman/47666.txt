’  ’ ’   CNN Commentator Van Jones made an unconventional point on   Saturday about the ongoing discussion of race relations and     in America. ’ ’   ”[Black people and the police] literally are having and   describing the same experience,” Jones said, ”the police say they   feel vulnerable  —   that’’s exactly what the kids in Black Lives   Matter are saying.” ’ ’   After a  on Thursday and at   least two more shootings of police officers in  and  on Friday, some   representatives have   said they feel like the ones with targets on their backs. ’ ’   Radio host and conservative political commentator Ben Ferguson   noted this week that officers told him ”we feel like people want   to kill us.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Another media influencer took issue with Jones’’ suggestion. The   Daily Beast’’s    Goldie Taylor,    of black people, ”They don’’t have the same experience. They don’’t   have the same power.” ’ ’   Taylor is referring to the fact that police have the power to   detain, arrest and, in some cases, kill under the protection of   the law. ’ ’   Speaking from Poland, President Obama said that he doesn’’t   believe America is as ”divided as some have suggested.” ’ ’   ”This is not who we want to be as Americans, and that serves as   the basis of us being able to move forward in a constructive and   positive way,” Obama said, referring to this week’’s unprecedented   violence in the US. ’ ”   Obama’s hopefulness echoed  by Facebook user Natasha Howell on Friday   describing an unexpected encounter she had with a police officer.   Howell, whose post has since gone viral, said she went into a   store where a white police officer was talking to a clerk. ” ’   In the post, Howell says the officer asked her how she was doing.   ”I’’m tired,” Howell said. ”Me too,” the officer responded, adding   ”I guess it’’s not easy being either of us right now, is it?”   According to Howell’’s posting, they both hugged it out. ’ ’  ’
