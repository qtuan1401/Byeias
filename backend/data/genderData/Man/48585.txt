’’ ”Larry Ellison used most of his   keynote session slot at this week’s Oracle Open World conference in San Francisco to trash Amazon and its $10 billion Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform.” ’Amazon has emerged as an unlikely rival to Oracle, .’ ’Today, Ellison fired back by detailing in great depth all the ways in which the upgraded, ”second generation” Oracle Cloud, announced this week, purportedly beats Amazon Web Services.’ ’”Ellison says.’ ”Chief among Ellison’s criticisms of Amazon Web Services: ” ’”You know when I’’m talking about Amazon, I’’m being nothing but fair. You can count on that,” Ellison says. ”It’’s just true. ”’ ’’ ”It wasn’t all negative: Ellison also showed off some of the design thinking that went into the   Oracle cloud. He’s promoting it as the     alternative to Amazon Web Services for developers of all shapes and sizes to use to build and host their apps. ” ”But it’s clear that Amazon’s shadow is hanging heavy over Oracle, which is  even as its   rival Microsoft establishes a solid niche for itself as the #2 player and the cloud of choice in the enterprise. ” ’Still, while Ellison is as enthusiastic as ever,  to truly be competitive in this   market.’ ’ ’ ’ ’
