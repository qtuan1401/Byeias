April 23 (UPI)  —   A college freshman at a suburban Chicago college died after being hit by a hammer during a track meet, the private school said. [Wheaton College freshman Ethan Roser, 19, died after the accident about 4:15 p. m. Saturday, according to a statement by the school. Roser, who transferred from Cincinnati in January, was volunteering at the track meet.  Paramedics treated Roser and he was transported to a local hospital, where he died, the statement said. “We are deeply grieved, but, because of our faith in Christ, not without hope,” said Wheaton College President Philip Ryken in a statement. “We ask people to pray for Ethan’s family, his friends, and our campus community. ” It wasn’t known whether Roser was volunteering at the hammer throw or at a nearby event. In the hammer event, athletes throw a metal ball  —   16 pounds for men and 8. 8 pounds for women  —   attached to a steel wire form inside a circle, according to International Association of Athletics Federation. The thrower usually makes three or four spins before releasing the ball. Roser was a member of the men’s soccer team, according to the athletic department’s website. Wheaton College is a private interdenominational Christian liberal arts college 25 miles west of downtown Chicago. The school had an enrollment of 2, 76 undergraduate and graduate students in 2015, according to the university website.
