’  ’ ’   A US regulator warned that banks risk inflating a commercial real   estate (CRE) bubble. ’ ’   Thomas Curry, US comptroller of the currency, said banks were   easing checks on borrowers and boosting loans to investors in the   sector. ’ ’   This creates more debt of a poor quality, at a time when   valuations of the underlying property assets are already   stretched. ’ ’   ””  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’     ’ ’   The combination of high debt levels and lax risk management could   prove to be toxic, Curry said: ”At the same time we are seeing   this high growth, our exams found looser underwriting standards   with   covenants, extended maturities, longer     periods, limited guarantor requirements, and     testing practices.” ’ ’   Banks are struggling to find safe, profitable assets in a   world where more than $10 trillion (£7. 6 trillion) in government   bonds has a negative yield, so they are turning to riskier debt.     ’ ’   The comptroller said banks were caught in a trap of having to   innovate and lower credit standards to stay competitive, while at   the same time needing to manage risk. ’
