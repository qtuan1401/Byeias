Sen. Lena Taylor ( ) reacted Saturday on MSNBC to the accusation that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been taking donations from the fossil fuel industry.  According to Taylor, Clinton “is not influenced by individuals who are supporting her. ” “Secretary Clinton is not influenced by individuals who are supporting her and whether or not they then choose to go and bundle dollars. This is not the issue. She’s been a person who has listened to people, she’s been a person who has advocated for what is practical and what is ‘get it done’ kinds of policies. And what we should be talking about are the issues, and not the things that will divert people from what is most important jobs.
