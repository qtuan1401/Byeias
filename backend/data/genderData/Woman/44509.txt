’  ’ ’   The other weekend I went with my family to a coffee   shop that my mother deemed ”the most beautiful” Starbucks   she’’d ever seen. ’ ”   It was a sprawling, comfortable space on the main street in   suburban Michigan, where we were visiting family. The exterior   was covered in wood shingles and river rocks. Customers lounged   in chairs outside and tapped away on their laptops at tables   indoors. Chatty baristas were happy to help us with my mom’s     venti   order, my cold brew, my dad’s tea, and   my brother’s request to use a bathroom. ” ’  ’ ’   It had little in common with the   Starbucks my parents   visit in North Carolina or the crowded store where I pick up my   mobile coffee orders in New York City. ’ ”   These differences show the central tension of what Starbucks has   become: all things to all people, and in the process, a brand   that’s become intermittently muddled and decidedly   middlebrow.  ” ’   Once the chain that persuaded Americans to spend $4 on a cup of   coffee with Italian names for drinks and sizes that made coffee   an elite experience bordering on pretentiousness, the Starbucks   of 2017 is just as known for the   Pumpkin Spice Latte   and the    Unicorn Frappuccino.  ’ ’   is sandwiched between   brands like Dunkin’’ Donuts and   McDonald’’s, which siphon off some of Starbucks’’ customers with   lower prices, and, at the other end, the ”Third Wave” coffee   chains such as Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle, with their precise     and baristas who make art out of latte foam. ’ ”   As Starbucks enters a new era, with plans to open 10, 000   locations in five years, and the move of longtime CEO Howard   Schultz (the man behind the brand’s most revolutionary choices)   from chief executive to chairman of the board, the company is   trying to figure out if it can be everything to everyone. ” ’   The means serving Unicorn Frappuccinos for     college students, nitro cold brew for snobs,   and a morning cup of joe for commuters on the go. All the while,   it needs to fend off competition that its own success helped   create at both ends of the market. ’ ’   At Starbucks image is key. And what some customers think about   Starbucks has long been reflected by the jokes about the chain. ’ ’  ’ ’   When Chris Allieri visited Starbucks in Boulder, Colorado, as a   freshman at the University of Colorado in 1992, he had to call   his parents. ’ ’   ”It was magic, like a temple to coffee,” Allieri, the founder and   principal of marketing firm Mulberry & Astor, told Business   Insider. ’ ”   The location, built in a former gas station, was modern, light,   and airy. The smell of coffee wafted through the air, as   employees ground beans in the store. Baristas  —   a new   word to Americans back then  —   gave off a perfectly cool vibe, and   the coffee options were seemingly endless. Everything about the   store was different from the cafés and convenience stores where   most people purchased   coffee in the ’90s, if they   even bought the beverage instead of just making it at home from   Folgers Crystals. ” ’   On the phone from his dorm, Allieri told his parents he was   convinced that Starbucks would be the next big thing. ’ ’   ”I kept saying, ’’This is bigger than coffee  —   you don’’t get it! ’’”   he recalls telling his father. ”And I remember him saying, ’’Well,   you should buy the stock. ’’ As if. I was a broke college student.   If only I had the money, or the foresight.” If Allieri had   purchased $1, 000 in Starbucks stock back in 1992  —   the year the   company went public  —   he’’d have $180, 000 today. ’ ’  ’ ”   Starbucks has made billions of dollars by creating something that   didn’t exist: a space where customers could not only treat   themselves to fancy   beverages but also relax and   socialize. It was a brand that immediately felt sophisticated and   elite, making customers like Allieri feel as if they were joining   an exclusive club. ” ’   When the first Starbucks opened in New York City, The New York   Times had to define what a latte was and explain it was   pronounced ” .” Starbucks played up its exotic nature in   everything it did, down to its sizes, with ”grande” and ”venti”   providing a connection to the Italian coffee culture that   inspired Schultz. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Starbucks was an affordable way to get luxury,” Craig   Garthwaite, an associate professor of strategy at   Northwestern’’s Kellogg School of Management, told Business   Insider. While Starbucks was clearly pricier than your average   cup of coffee, it was a small luxury in the grand scheme of   things. Most people couldn’’t afford to buy a BMW, but they could   treat themselves with a ”grande vanilla latte” as a small symbol   of their expensive tastes. ’ ’   In the 1990s and 2000s, the little details that set Starbucks   apart and allowed it to charge a few extra dollars, were new and   foreign  —   and ridiculed by many. As Starbucks expanded, the chain   was mocked for calling its beverage sizes tall, grande,   and venti instead of small, medium, and large. ’ ’   In 2004,   that hit on the tropes of the venti joke: ’ ’ ’ ’   In 2006, the venti jokes were so common that  lambasting a ”certain competitor” for   using elitist words that were a perplexing mix of French and   Italian. In the ad, which it called ”Fritalian,” customers stand,   slack jawed, looking at a coffee shop’’s menu board filled with a   nonsensical mishmash of words, such as ”Limon Au Deau,”   ”Lattcapssreso,” and ”Isto Cinno.” ’ ’   ”Delicious lattes from Dunkin’’ Donuts  —   you order them in   English, not Fritalian,” the narrator says in the commercial’’s   conclusion. ’ ’   Dunkin’’ advertising ”lattes” shows how mainstream the beverage   had become over the last decade, in large part due to Starbucks’’   influence. As Starbucks grew, lattes had become a symbol of   elitist liberals, out of touch with the average American. In   2004, a conservative PAC ran an ad during the Democratic Caucuses   featuring an Iowa couple telling Howard Dean to take his   ”            New York           freak show” back to Vermont. ’ ”   Yet in 2008, Dunkin’ Donuts was selling more inexpensive versions   of Starbucks’   beverages, while maintaining the brand’s     identity. ” ”   Starbucks didn’t want an   identity. For Schultz,   confusing, potentially elitist naming conventions weren’t a bug;   they were a feature. ” ’   ”Customers believed that their grande lattes demonstrated that   they were better than others  —   cooler, richer, more   sophisticated,” Bryant Simon wrote in his book about Starbucks,   ”Everything But the Coffee.” ”As long as they could get all of   this for the price of a cup of coffee, even an inflated one, they   eagerly handed over their money, three and four dollars at a   clip.” ’ ’ ’ ’   Starbucks’’ strategy has long been different from that of   McDonald’’s or Dunkin’’ Donuts. While Dunkin’’ Donuts attracts   customers with low prices and convenience, Starbucks’’ strategy   has been rooted in attracting customers to what Schultz called   the ”romance and theatre” of the   experience. ’ ’   ”Any retailer can throw a few ingredients in a cup and say here’’s   your latte, but Starbucks has differentiated themselves with the   experience,” Melody Overton, the creator of the blog Starbucks   Melody, said. ’ ”   When customers are making venti jokes, Starbucks is at its best,   as an aspirational brand that’s unlike any other. The chain’s   problems come when the venti becomes the norm. ” ’  ’ ”   Throughout the ’70s and much of the ’80s, Starbucks was a coffee   roaster first and a coffee shop second. But in the early ’80s,   Schultz joined the company and became convinced that Starbucks   could achieve a seemingly impossible goal: remain premium while   becoming ubiquitous. ” ”   Schultz had never wanted Starbucks to stay small, like other   regional chains such as Peet’s. In fact, Schultz left the company   for a brief period in the  ’80s because he was unable to   convince Starbucks founders that the company could be an   international chain, not just a coffee roaster. In 1987, Schultz   acquired the Starbucks’ brand and 17 locations from its founders,   who decided to focus their energy on Peet’s. Then Schultz began   planting the seeds for one of the most ambitious retail   expansions in history. ” ’   Between 1998 and 2008, Starbucks grew from 1, 886 stores to   16, 680. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”From the beginning, what they were hoping to be is the third   place between home and work,” Garthwaite said, referring to the   chain’’s  to become a meeting place. ”To achieve that goal, you   have to be everywhere.” And soon Starbucks was. ’ ’   Even when Starbucks had just 700 stores, the chain seemed   pervasive, with NPR’’s ”All Things Considered” announcing as an    that Starbucks’’ was building a   ”transcontinental coffee slurry pipeline” as part of efforts to   become omnipresent. In 2000, an Onion headline read ”New   Starbucks Opens In Rest Room Of Existing Starbucks.” That same   year ”The Simpsons” aired an episode in which Bart visits a mall   in which every store was swiftly being turned into a Starbucks.    about seeing a Starbucks   across from a Starbucks, which he declared a sign of the end of   the universe and evidence against a loving god. ’ ’   It wasn’t an exaggeration. Around that time, if you stood at just   the right spot in New York’s Astor Place, you could see three   Starbucks without moving your head. ’ ’   But unlike the venti jokes, these jabs spelled trouble for the   company.  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”The number of new stores got ahead of Starbucks’’ ability to have   the [employees] to staff those stores,” Starbucks CEO Kevin   Johnson told Business Insider. The company ”got over its skis,”   sacrificing training and upscale marketing for speedy growth and   shareholder returns without thinking of the consequences. ’ ’   As a result, Starbucks made decisions that would leave the   company reeling as it moved away from its roots as a   sophisticated, luxury brand. ’ ”   Schultz had stepped down as CEO in 2000. While he remained on the   board, new leadership was more focused on expansion than   safeguarding Starbucks’ unique brand. ” ’  ’ ’   Opening locations across the US and beyond meant adding menu   items that appealed to a wider swath of customers, from the   failed   Chantico, which launched in 2005 and lasted a   year, to the fruity Sorbetto, which launched in 2008 and . To speed up operations, stores   swapped   La Marzocco espresso machines for automatic   machines. Starbucks no longer smelled like coffee as the chain   had begun brewing from   packaging. ’ ’   On their own, each change would have likely gone unnoticed, but   taken as a whole they were almost deadly. ’ ’   ”The damage was slow and quiet, incremental, like a single loose   thread that unravels a sweater inch by inch,” Schultz says in his   book ”Onward.” ’ ’   While customers may not have been able to pinpoint the changes,   they noticed a different environment at Starbucks. ”They lost a   little bit of their luster  —   a little bit of their chutzpah, a   little bit of their sparkle,” Allieri said of Starbucks in the    . ’ ’   As quality slipped at Starbucks,    and other   competitors smelled opportunity, adding   lattes and other specialty coffee beverages to their menus at   lower prices. Customers began buying their coffee elsewhere. ’ ’   ”More and more people were asking themselves, ’’Why am I paying $4   for a cup of coffee? ’’” said Oded Netzer, an associate professor   of business at Columbia. ’ ’   It was a grim situation. Starbucks had built a business on its   sophisticated brand. Then, as it became ubiquitous, the chain   became sterile and corporate. Further, in the recession,   expensive coffee was no longer an affordable luxury. ’ ’  ’ ’   The chain finally reached a . ’ ’   In January of that year, Schultz returned as CEO, with the   mission of . In February,   Schultz closed all 7, 100 US Starbucks locations for three and a   half hours to retrain baristas on how to make the perfect   espresso. And in July, Starbucks announced it was closing 600   underperforming stores. ’ ’   As the company’’s fabled ”visionary,” Schulz began trying to bring   the company back to his roots, a role he took with zeal. Beans   were once again ground in stores, a new type of espresso machine   was installed across all locations, and stores were redesigned to   ”recapture the coffeehouse feel,” adding . ’ ”   He righted the sinking ship financially. The company’s stock has   increased by 1, 140% from Starbucks’ low in late 2008, and the   company has opened 10, 000 new locations around the world. ” ’  ’ ’   But few would say Starbucks fully recaptured the premium image it   had crafted in the ’’90s. Instead, it entered a period of   appealing to both the wealthy and the working class, serving the   urbane and the moms in minivans who go through its  .   Shoppers expect a Starbucks to be nearby, and they no longer   wince calling a drink ”grande.” ’ ’   This is a big reason Starbucks is stuck in the middle now,   sandwiched between chains focusing on   value, like   Dunkin’’ and McDonald’’s, and the ”third wave” of   shops.   Some are independent; others are fancier chains, like   Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle. ’ ”   Starbucks’ ubiquity empowered rivals at both ends. Over the past   year, these problems have once again reared their heads as   Starbucks’ stock stagnated. Store traffic slowed after years of   growth  . ” ’   Instead of being mocked for being pretentious, Starbucks now   finds itself with something like the opposite problem. ’ ’  ’ ”   The story of Starbucks’ current place in Americana can be summed   up in one drink: the Pumpkin Spice Latte. ” ’   The PSL, as it’s known, sometimes derisively, is a seasonal   concoction of cloves, nutmeg, and other spices synonymous with   fall. It’s been on the menu since 2003, when Starbucks decided it   wanted to create an autumn drink. ’ ’   According to lore, the PSL was created while brainstorming ideas   for a new   seasonal beverage. The innovation team   sat with a pumpkin pie on one side and an espresso machine on the   other, alternating shots of espresso and bites of pie in an   attempt to deconstruct how best to combine the two flavors. ’ ”   The drink has become an autumnal tradition. Over the past 13   years, Starbucks has sold 200 million cups of its Pumpkin Spice   Latte. It’s even created an entire category of PSL products,   . It has   a . ” ’   It also happens to be the defining drink of the ”basic    .” ’ ’  ’ ’   If you are an American between the ages of 10 and 30, being   basic isn’’t necessarily a definable term; it’’s a feeling   you get about a certain kind of person, almost always female. To   be a ”basic    ” is to buy into an unoriginal image of what is   enjoyable and feminine, and to broadcast these uninspired tastes   to the world. It’’s the opposite of being edgy or cool  —   it’’s   behaving as expected, buying into a certain degree of groupthink.   Wearing Uggs and leggings? Basic. Instagramming your fingers,   coated in Essie nail polish, clutching a rainbow bagel at brunch   with your girls? Basic. Pumpkin Spice Lattes? The most basic   thing of all. ’ ’   Thought Catalogue listed ”liking Pumpkin Spice Lattes” as No. 2   on the list of  in 2012. ’ ’   By fall 2014 the topic had exploded. Twitter was  about ”basic white girls” loving PSLs.   More than one group of white people released a parody rap video   about Pumpkin Spice Lattes (”pumpkin spice latte rap” yields more   than 2, 000 results on YouTube). BuzzFeed published  ”breaking down why   we’re actually dismissive of all things pumpkin spice.” ’ ’  ’ ’   For Starbucks, the onslaught of PSL jokes is good and bad. On one   hand, the Pumpkin Spice Latte is incredibly popular  —   estimates   suggest the chain has made . On the other hand, being   seen as a beacon for the basic is far from the upscale     image that the Starbucks brand is built upon and that   Schultz fought tooth and nail to win back in 2008. ’ ’   ”You can say tough luck, we’’re going to go with the new customers   because they’’re the majority now,” Netzer said on Starbucks’’   attempts to serve both mainstream teens and coffee snobs. ”The   problem with that is [the original] strategy is why Starbucks can   charge $3 more for coffee than McDonald’’s or Dunkin’’ Donuts.” ’ ’   Schultz righted the chain after it became sterile  —   but he wasn’’t   able to regain the brand’’s upscale ”cool” factor. ’ ’   ”Something we all have to come to terms with as we get   older is we’’re all going to lose the it factor at some point,”   Garthwaite said. It’’s nearly impossible for a large corporation   to maintain the ”edgy, hip factor” that comes with being a small   company doing something revolutionary, that Starbucks managed to   capture in the late ’’80s and early ’’90s. ’ ’   But Starbucks wants to try. For the past two years, Netzer says,   the chain has realized that it was once again straying from its   roots and doubled down on coffee to win back the ”coffee   connoisseurs” who were the brand’’s base in the ’’90s. ’ ’  ’ ’   The first result of that plan opened in Seattle in 2014. Called a   ”Roastery,” the    location combines coffee   production, menu tests, and architectural whimsy. The Roastery   has become a huge part of the company’’s plans to roll out an   upscale brand called Reserve. ’ ’   ”Ubiquity will create sort of a natural gravitation pull toward a   commodity,” said CEO Johnson. Becoming a commodity is obviously   something Starbucks wants to avoid, even as it grows. ”Which is   why our strategy really includes a key pillar to elevate the   brand  —   which is why we’’re building Roasteries.” ’ ’   Globally, 1, 000 Reserve stores will serve     concoctions and food made in the stores. And 20% of all Starbucks   locations will feature a Reserve Bar, to allow for more complex   ways to prepare drinks. ’ ”   Still, don’t count out the power of the Pumpkin Spice     basics just yet. In April, as evidence grew that   Starbucks was planning to open  the chain launched its     —   and many would say most basic  —     beverage yet: the Unicorn Frappuccino. ” ’  ’ ”   The Unicorn Frappuccino is a brightly colored beverage that   changes its color and flavor when stirred. Aesthetically, it’s   remarkable, looking better when you photograph it yourself than   in company advertising. Culinarily, it’s kind of gross  —   a sugar   bomb that tastes like an Orange Julius married with Sour   Skittles. ” ’   It was also an instant hit, flooding social media with customers’   photos of the drink, providing Starbucks with immeasurable free   advertising. And nowhere was the drink more prevalent than on the   ”basic” hashtag on Instagram, where half of the posts are of the   Unicorn Frappuccino. Scrolling through #basic, it’’s as though the   hashtag has been transformed into a Starbucks ad. ’ ’  ’ ”   Imagine walking into a Starbucks in 2022. The building is   towering  —   an open space the size of a large auditorium. In one   corner, there’s a bar with baristas mixing nonalcoholic coffee   cocktails; in another, a roaster heating beans; in another, a     restaurant. Employees are clad in leather aprons and     hipster garb. Scruffy coffee roasters wear beard nets.   The menu is made up of items that easily surpass the $10 mark  —     drinks that seem more fit for a classy Manhattan cocktail menu   than a coffee shop. ” ”   Then imagine walking into another version of Starbucks five years   down the road from today. Customers are staring at their iPhones,   rushing in just as an employee greets them by name and hands them   their drink. There’s no cash register, no workers taking orders,   just baristas making drinks and handing off beverages to   customers rushing in and out. ” ”   In fact, both of these Starbucks exist now, within just a few   miles of each other in Seattle, Washington. One is the first   Starbucks Roastery and the other is the first Starbucks’ test     store, which was launched earlier in April in   Starbucks’ offices. ” ”   Looking at Starbucks’ history, it’s clear that the brand evolved    —   and will continue to evolve  —   out of necessity, as it is pulled   in different directions. ” ’  ’ ’   ”As our customer base has grown, sometimes our customer wants   that third place experience, and sometimes they want   convenience,” Johnson told Business Insider. ”We’’re not   sacrificing one for the other, but it is a delicate balance.” ’ ”   Striking a balance means drawing from all of Starbucks’ past eras    —   and the lessons Starbucks has learned from the jokes people   tell. ” ’   The Roastery and Reserve stores are perhaps the obvious response   to people mocking Starbucks. The new store formats, with their     brews and siphoned coffee, are created to counter   jokes about Unicorn Frappuccinos, Pumpkin Spice Lattes, and the   increasingly basic nature of Starbucks. Schultz, who stepped down   as CEO but will remain on the board, is at the helm of the   project. ’ ’   With the Roasteries, Starbucks has a chance to bring back the   innovative, exotic Starbucks brand of the ’’90s but at a much   larger scale. Schultz told Business Insider in October that the   Roasteries have shown Starbucks that there is a ”real   opportunity” for Starbucks to create a ”  brand.” ’ ’   ”As companies face the threat of   and mobile shopping,   the burden of responsibility of the    retailers is   to create a very immersive, dynamic experience,” he said. ’ ’   But Starbucks needs to be more than  . It also needs   to be convenient, basic,   and more. ’ ’  ’ ’   Johnson says that the biggest reason you don’’t hear jokes about   ”Starbucks in Starbucks’’ bathrooms” as much any more is that the   company has changed what a Starbucks looks like, rolling out new   store formats in recent years and with more in the works. ’ ’   ”Take everything from an express store on Wall Street that is   very small square footage, small menu, and it’’s all for   convenience. Customers walk up, we serve them their food and   beverage quickly,” Johnson said, listing store formats. ”Then,   it’’s our core Starbucks stores  —   the third place. Starbucks   stores with  . And now we’’ve got Reserve bars and   Reserve stores and Roasteries.” ’ ”   In essence, Schultz and Johnson have realized that as Starbucks   became ubiquitous it picked up new types of customers, from snobs   to basics. Wedged between   chains and hip coffee shops,   Starbucks’ new strategy is to create different types of stores  —     all with an   —   that match up with different   types of competitors. Express stores are as fast as any     chain, while Roasteries serve beverages as complex as any indie   shop. ” ’   ”They’’re bringing back the coffee and bringing back the service,”   Nezder said about the proliferation of Starbucks formats. ”I   think it’’s brilliant. I think it’’s addressing the problem they’’ve   had for years.” ’ ’ ’ ”   Others aren’t as convinced that Starbucks can pull of the   balancing act. ” ’   ”You can’’t be everything to everyone,” said Gairthwaite, who is   skeptical of Starbucks’’ ability to compete with smaller brands   like Intelligentsia and Stumptown while continuing to meet the   needs of the majority of customers. ”They’’ve always struggled   with this idea that some people want the artistry and some people   just want a drink.” ’ ”   Vlogger Bethany Mota may have best captured this Starbucks   moment. Her video,  which describes customers including the Secret   Menu Snob, the Instagram Addict, and the Rude Customer, has   racked up more 1. 5 million views on YouTube. Starbucks’ customers   are increasingly visiting the chain for different reasons  —   and   Starbucks is responding by trying to tailor its stores to all   these needs. ” ’   ”The problem with success is you get harder, more difficult   problems to solve,” Garthwaite said. ’ ’   Perhaps the next Starbucks joke will be, who wants a     Nitro Unicorn   to go for $10? ’ ’Starbucks is sandwiched between inexpensive. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
