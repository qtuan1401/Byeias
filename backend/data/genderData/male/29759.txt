On Sunday, The Guardian reported the Chicago Police Department had made arrests for “under four percent” of the “nearly 2, 000   shooting incidents” from January 1 through August 28. [And at the time of The Guardian’s report, Chicago PD had arrested “about 16 percent” of those behind the soaring number of homicides that occurred in the city from January 1 through August 28. According to The Guardian, the “16 percent” arrest rate is a far cry from previous years and indicative of a decrease in “overall arrests in Chicago  …    [which] have dropped 27 percent compared with last year. ”  On Tuesday, Breitbart News reported that Chicago surpassed 500 homicides for the year via the 13 deaths that resulted from Labor Day Weekend violence. And the violence of Labor Day Weekend came on the heels of the deadliest August Chicago has witnessed in 20 years. ABC News reported “472 total shooting victims” and 90 fatalities for August alone. The Guardian spoke to a resident who lives in the Chicago suburb of Englewood, where two men, both gang affiliated, and the women with them were shot on Monday night. The resident said, “Come around here at 9 o’clock tonight it’ll sound like you somewhere in Baghdad. ” On May 11, Breitbart News reported BET’s contention that death has become so commonplace in Chicago that the police rarely even investigate, much less make arrests. BET claimed there were “over 500”   murders in Chicago in 2015 yet only “55 of them resulted in a legitimate investigation. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
