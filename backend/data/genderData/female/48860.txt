’  ’ ’   Alaska Airlines removed a passenger from a plane after he   harassed a female flight attendant during her safety   demonstration. ’ ’   Amber Nelson, a passenger on the flight leaving from the     Airport, wrote about  on Facebook. She said the male   passenger called out ”ooh, sexy” while the female flight   attendant was demonstrating how to use a life vest. ’ ’   ”Before we could do more than glare in his direction, the flight   attendant removed her vest, purposely walked up to him and said,   ’’You need to be respectful,’’ and started to walk back to her   task,” Nelson said in the post. ”He said, ’’C’’mon, I’’m just   playing with you! ’’” ’ ’   After the safety demonstration concluded, the male who had been   catcalling the flight attendant was asked to collect his   belongings and leave. ’ ’   An Alaska Airlines spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider   that the incident did occur, adding ”we stand behind our   employees.” ’ ’   ”I felt honored as a patron of the airline  —   and as a woman  —     because Alaska Airlines supported their staff and those of us on   board who were demeaned by another passenger’’s juvenile and   exceedingly disrespectful behavior,” Nelson wrote in her post. ’ ’   You can read the post in full here: ’ ’ ’
