On July 1, California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation requiring residents to surrender or otherwise dispose of all   gun magazines. [The   gun magazine ban goes into effect July 1, 2017, and the language of the ban  —   contained in SB 1446  —   leaves no question as to the limited options for owners of such magazines:  Brown, a   Democrat, also signed a bill creating ammunition background checks in the state, which means   citizens will have to go through a background check for ammunition in the same way they go through a check for firearm purchases. And, as the Los Angeles Times reports, Brown also signed a “ban [on] the sale of semiautomatic rifles equipped with bullet buttons” and a prohibition against loaning guns to family members  —   unless said family members also pass a background check. Regarding the ammunition background checks, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence told the New York Times that the hope is they will serve as a backdoor tool for finding guns that aren’t on the books  —   something gun control advocates have been trying to do on the national level for decades. The Brady Campaign’s Amanda Wilcox said, “It can give us a handle on who has illegal guns in the state. ” However, there is a difference between “illegal guns” and   guns, which may include legal guns (and legal gun owners) that are not in the state government’s database. It is important to point out that the   magazine ban basically limits Californians to using the same size magazines Elliot Rodger used in his 2014 mass shooting in Santa Barbara.
