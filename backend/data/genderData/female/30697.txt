A Wisconsin man suffered stab wounds to his face after confronting the vandal of his Minnesota Vikings inflatable. [During the Vikings win over the Houston Texans on Sunday, Dave Moschel, 36, heard a disturbance in his yard. He confronted a    man allegedly slashing his Vikings lawn decoration with a box cutter.  When the fan confronted the vandal, he turned his attention from the inflatable Vikings player to the very real Vikings fan. The alleged assailant used the cutting implement to slash the homeowner seven times. Moschel sports stitches on his forehead and below his eye as a result of the attack. Dave Moschel, Stoughton Vikings fan stabbed last night over inflatable, says he’s OK, all things considered.

And this is the one time I did. I’m kind of glad I did, because he would have been dead, and I would have had to live with that. ” Despite the incident and his Stoughton, Wisconsin, home sitting in the middle of Green Bay Packers country, Moschel says he plans to use Vikings duct tape to mend his   football player and continue to display his unpopular allegiance in his yard.
