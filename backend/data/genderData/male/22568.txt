J. Christian Adams of PJ Media writes a heartfelt tribute to late lamented Breitbart editor Mike Flynn:  From PJ Media: Had Mike Flynn been born a couple of centuries earlier, he’d be the fellow deciding behind which stand of trees Americans would hide to pick off redcoats. Unfortunately, Flynn, one of the original editors in chief at Brietbart, died yesterday. Flynn was a brilliant and knowledgeable fellow who had a knack for channeling the zeal of the rising new media into an effective and credible force.  He leaves behind a charming wife and family and muscular and influential conservative new media made more so by his work. Too many young and effective voices are dying early. Just a few years ago, Mike, Andrew Breitbart and Chip Gerdes could be a swirl of activity on email and the phone, “weaponizing” the next big wave. That they are all gone is hard to contemplate, like turning a bolt of lightning into darkness. Read the rest of this tribute to Mike Flynn here.
