The father of a victim of the Paris terrorist attacks is suing social media giants Facebook, Google, and Twitter for allegedly allowing terrorists to   via their platforms. [Reynaldo Gonzalez, father of Nohemi Gonzales, the only American to die in the Paris attacks, is suing the tech companies he believes to be responsible for the coordination of the Paris terrorist attacks, reports TMZ. Reynaldo claims that the communications networks developed by Google, Facebook, and Twitter are one of the reasons that ISIS have become the biggest terrorist group in the world and have so easily been able to spread their message of hatred for the western world.  The claims being brought against the companies are that of negligence and even profiting from the terrorist groups. Google has made a significant amount of ad revenue from monetized videos posted by ISIS declaring their hateful messages and even depicting gruesome beheadings. This is not the first time someone has attempted to sue a tech company for facilitating the communication of terrorist groups. In January of 2014, Tamara Fields, the widow of Lloyd Fields, an American police officer murdered by an ISIS terrorist in Jordan during an attack on a police training centre in Amman, sued Twitter for the same reason. It would seem many people affected by these terrorist attacks believe that tech giants are to some degree complicit in the attacks themselves and must be held accountable.
