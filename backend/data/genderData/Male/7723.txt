PARIS  —   A fire swept through a bar in northern France early Saturday, killing at least 13 people and injuring six others, the police and the interior minister said. The fire broke out after midnight at a birthday party at the Cuba Libre bar in the city of Rouen, in the Normandy region. More than 80 firefighters battled the blaze, Rouen’s mayor, Yvon Robert, said after it was extinguished. The fire was “totally accidental,” Mr. Robert told Europe 1 radio, mentioning a possible gas explosion “from the heat in a basement room doubtless too small for the number of people present. ” It was not known how many people had been at the club. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a judicial investigation had been opened to discover the cause of the blaze.
