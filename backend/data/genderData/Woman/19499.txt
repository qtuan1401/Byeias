Users have accused Twitter of censoring WikiLeaks’ DNC email release after the related trending hashtag was suddenly pulled before returning to the trending list in a modified form. [“#DNCLeaks” was one of the top trending topics on Twitter this Friday with over 250, 000 tweets reported to have been made under the hashtag since WikiLeaks released over 19, 000 leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee.  Later on in the day, the hashtag was reported to have gone missing from the trending bar completely for around 20 minutes, before returning under the less popular hashtag “#DNCleak”. The change meant that those investigating the new trending hashtag would not see all of the other posts tagged under the previous version, effectively hiding over 250, 000 tweets from the public. “Twitter is still trying to censor this trend! Now #DNCleak is trending instead of original #DNCLeaks! Keep talking guys, expose corruption” commented one user on the change. “It seems @Twitter is now trying to push #DNCLeak instead of #DNCleaks in an effort to keep this from trending” posted another. @wikileaks It seems @Twitter is now trying to push #DNCLeak instead of #DNCleaks in an effort to keep this from trending.  —   KENT GUTSCHKE (@martiandeathray) July 23, 2016,  twitter is trending #DNCLeak instead of #DNCLeaks  wow. i’m totally speechless at all this mass corruption,  —   sarah bellum (@zzzanthropology) July 23, 2016,  Oh, right, now we’re supposed to hashtag #DNCLeak haha instead of #DNCLeaks  —   our bad, right? #feeltheBern,  —   Marie   Lee (@MarieMyungOkLee) July 23, 2016,  Wary users have also brought up the fact that Twitter is now refusing people the ability to post links from “WikiLeaks. com” only allowing those from “WikiLeaks. org” in what appears to be a further attempt to clamp down on WikiLeaks’ traffic flow during the DNC email leaks. Attempts to link to the site will return users with an error message stating “This request looks like it might be automated.
