’  ’ ’   White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday said no one   can know the effects of the American Health Care Act on sick   Americans until the bill goes into effect. ’ ’   Spicer said there are ”so many variables” to take into   account when trying to make a determination on how   legislation would affect people with preexisting   conditions, which has been a major sticking point about the   legislation in recent days. ’ ’   ”To do an analysis with any level of factual basis would be   literally impossible,” Spicer said at the daily White House press   briefing. ’ ’   The American Health Care Act has undergone a number of changes in   recent days, including the addition of an amendment that critics   say would weaken protections for people with preexisting   conditions. ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’     ’ ’   Spicer argued that the AHCA, even with the amendment, would   protect Americans with preexisting conditions. He said they would   still have affordable coverage. ’ ”   The AHCA has not received any updated analysis from the   Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal   agency that estimates the effects of of the bill  —     including coverage gains or losses, the effect on the   deficit, and any   changes on people’s premiums. The   CBO said it would not have a score for the updated AHCA until   next week at the earliest. ” ’   A GOP source told Business Insider that members expect the AHCA   to be brought to the floor of the House on Thursday. ’ ’White House press secretary Sean Spicer on. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
