Police found a double homicide suspect in Florida biting off parts of a victim’s face Monday, Fox 31 reports.  Martin County Sheriff’s Office was called to a home in Tequesta, FL by a neighbor who said he had been stabbed while trying to break up a fight. The deputy who was first on the scene saw the suspect on top of the male victim in the driveway biting off parts of the man’s face, police say. An attempt at stopping the suspect with a stun gun had no effect. The deputy employed a   officer, who bit the suspect, but it did not stop the suspect. Deputies had to pry him off the victim. The victim’s wife was found dead in the home’s garage by investigators. The neighbor who called 911 was taken to a nearby hospital and is reportedly going to recover.
