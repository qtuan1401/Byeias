London (CNN) What do a tattoo and the EU referendum have in common? They’re both permanent. That’s what message this   tattoo parlor in London has for British voters. ”Brexit Tattoos” were offering a variety of free satirical   tattoos to highlight the importance of the vote. ”We want to tell them that this is such an important decision to not take lightly,” said Rosie Warin from We Are Europe    a campaign aimed at encouraging young people to vote in favor of Britain remaining in the European Union. ”Much like a bad tattoo, if you make the wrong decision, you’re going to wake up on Friday morning and really regret it for the rest of your life,” she told CNN. Designs included depictions of UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage and former London mayor Boris Johnson, as well as several ironic messages such as ”  Britain” and ”seas of doubt.” ”Two people have got these tattoos and it’s been quite amazing to see and hear their stories,” Warin said. ”Even though they’re doing it in irony, they’re also getting this to recognize the significance of the vote.”
