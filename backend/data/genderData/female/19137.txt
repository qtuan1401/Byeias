An apartment complex in Utah faced heavy backlash after they made tenants sign a new agreement requiring them to “like” the complex’s page on Facebook. [The new agreement, which has since been revoked after public outcry, was reported to have been stuck to tenant’s doors at the City Park Apartments complex, Salt Lake City.  “Facebook is totally optional. For them to force someone’s hand to do this is kind of ridiculous,” said City Park resident Jason Ring to the BBC. “I’m hoping this will bring more light to the fact that this was really inappropriate  …     They should never have tried this stunt in the first place. ” “The biggest issue that I have with it is that it seems to be discriminatory against elderly individuals and disabled individuals who are unable to utilize an online presence such as Facebook,” said tenant rights lawyer Zachary Myers to KSL. In a bizarre statement, City Park Apartments’ community manager Ana Raphael blamed the incident on an upcoming pool party, claiming that the addendum was there in order to “provide some protection” to residents from photographs that may be taken. “As part of opening its pool and an anticipated pool party, City Park desired to provide some protection to its residents and its owners from usage of photos on its Facebook page from all community events, including the opening pool party,” read the statement. “The Facebook Addendum was provided to them to assist in that protection  …     That addendum went beyond the request and intent of City Park Apartments, and was not carefully reviewed to ensure that it met with their needs and requests,” it explained. “We sincerely apologise for any confusion this may have caused and hope to earn your positive comments through our customer service efforts and not through any perceived obligation”. City Parks Apartments has since received a wave of negative reviews on Facebook and Yelp.
