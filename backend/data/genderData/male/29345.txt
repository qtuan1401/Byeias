Staffers for Hillary Clinton are defending the use of the Rachel Platten anthem “Fight Song” during her campaign rallies, a tune many thought was overplayed during the Democratic National Convention. [“’Fight Song’ is an anthem. ‘Fight Song’ is a way of f***ing life,” one anonymous Clinton staffer tells Yahoo News. “It   brings me joy. ”  Clinton’s millennial vote director, Sarah Audelo, attempted a more serious defense.  “For me, ‘Fight Song’ is a reminder of what’s at stake in this election,” Audelo said. “The fight for immigration reform, the protection of black lives, environmental justice and the continued fight for reproductive justice. We can’t afford to give up  —   the stakes are too high. ” After the Yahoo News article about “Fight Song” refueled hatred for the song, another Clinton staffer urged all of her followers to defend the tune: Listening to Fight Song on repeat all day and encourage you to do the same #ImWithFightSong https:  .  cc: @hunterw,  —   Gwen Rocco (@gwenrocco) August 23, 2016,  For the record, the lyrics of the tune “Fight Song” are posted below: Like a small boatOn the oceanSending big wavesInto motionLike how a single wordCan make a heart openI might only have one matchBut I can make an explosion, And all those things I didn’t sayWrecking balls inside my brainI will scream them loud tonightCan you hear my voice this time?
