’  ’ ’   The Model S, the first car that Tesla designed and engineered   from scratch, has been perfected. ’ ”   On Tuesday, the   automaker announced a  creating in   the the process the $135, 000 Model S P100D, an        that can travel 315 miles between charges on its 100     battery and blast from   mph in 2. 5 seconds.   That’s faster that a   Ferrari and Porsche   hypercars. ” ”   One hundred is a nice round number and if you ask me, a great   stopping point for further Model S performance upgrades. It’s   terrific that Tesla has taken its most successful vehicle,   representing the bulk of its sales to date, and continually made   it better. And sure, even more range on a single charge would be   welcome. But 315 miles is pretty good. And 2. 5 seconds for the   run from   mph is ridonkulous. ” ’   Should we eagerly anticipate the P110D or the P200D or the P1000D   and the relentless assault by the madmen of Palo Alto on the laws   of physics? ’ ’   Perhaps, but from here on out, anything new for Model S on   performance is gravy. ’ ’   Tesla has higher priorities. Mainly, getting the Model 3     vehicle launched on schedule in 2017 (Tesla has a   history of missing launch dates) and improving its Autopilot      technology to remain competitive. as   the master narrative in the    moment shifts   from electric cars to cars that can drive themselves, as evinced   by big recent moves from Uber (  Volvos in   Pittsburgh right now) and Ford (a fully autonomous fleet on the   road by 2021). ’ ’  ’ ”   And let’s not forget about Tesla’s massive battery plant, the   Gigafactory, which recently opened in Nevada. It has to supply   enough   battery cells to fulfill Musk’s goal of Tesla   delivering 500, 000 vehicles annually by 2018. ” ”   Oh, also, the acquisition of SolarCity by Tesla. The        startup was founded by Musk’s cousins,   Musk is chairman of the board, and the company has been   struggling, losing half of its   market cap this   year. ” ”   In the grand scheme of Tesla’s   history, the Model S   is a triumph, so it’s easy to understand why Musk and his team   would want to continue to revisit that well as the future   challenges mount. The Model S was Motor Trend’s Car of the Year   in 2013, and it performed so exceptionally in Consumer   Reports’ tests that the magazine had to recalibrate its ratings   scale. ” ”   I’ve driven the car a number of times. It’s good. Very, very   good. Sleek, fast, remarkably practical, stylish, and symbolic of   how Silicon Valley and its ethos can reinvent a machine that for   100 years in the US was dominated by Detroit, and in the past few   decades by the arrival of the Japanese and the Germans. ” ’  ’ ’   To a degree, further incremental improvements to the Model S will   be driven by the demands of the Model X and by consumers demands   for greater range. That’’s why we got the 100 kWh pack, which   makes for a faster Model X, in ”Ludicrous Mode,” just as it makes   for a faster Model S.  ’ ”   But if I were Musk, I wouldn’t devote too much more attention to   these vehicles. ” ’   The Model 3 has to be the focus, and although that $35, 000 car   will be   and have a range of 200 mph, it really needs   an affordable battery pack. Value trumps performance, and even in   this case range.  ’ ”   Even if the Model 3 master plan doesn’t work out and Tesla has to   abandon its     ambitions, the Model S   will remain the best luxury sedan on the market. Tesla can sell   this car for $100, 000 on average and so over time should be able   to turn it into a   machine.  ” ’   That will be time to further amp up its performance. Then Tesla   can try to have the fastest production car in the known universe,   assuming intelligent life elsewhere shares our need for speed. ’ ”   For now, however, Tesla’s big push will be defined by Model 3. A   need for speed doesn’t matter all that much to the mass market.   Buyers in that space want reliability, value, and safety. A lot   of potential customers also want to be part of the Tesla story  —     375, 000 reservations, at $1, 000 a pop, have been logged for the   car. ” ”   This    stuff isn’t currently Tesla’s forte. But   in the future, it will have to be. And then Musk can get back to   his true passion: creating electric cars that can show up the   fastest, most exotic, most exclusive, and most expensive machines   ever made. ”
