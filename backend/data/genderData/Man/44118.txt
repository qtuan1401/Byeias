’  ’ ’   In August 2015, a friend of mine applied for a job as a product   manager at Google. ’ ’   After the initial screening step, he received an email from the   recruiter, telling him what to expect in a phone interview with a   senior PM at Google. ’ ”   When he shared it with me, I couldn’t believe it. In my work at    a candidate     platform, I’ve never seen an email that makes it feel like the   recruiter is working for the candidate rather than the company. ” ’   But this one did. The recruiter told the candidate what types of   questions to expect and how to prepare, including suggested   websites and blogs to read before showing up. ’ ”   The approach actually makes so much sense. A recruiter’s job is   to make sure the two people fall in love  —   the candidate and the   hiring manager. ” ’’ ’   In this case, the recruiter did everything he could to make the   candidate win  —   and if the candidate wins, it is ultimately a win   for the company. ’ ”   This is only one example, and we can’t say that every Google   recruiter, filling for every open position, sends a similar   email, but it’s something that would be nice to see from more   recruiters, in any industry. The candidate did not get the offer,   but it’s worth taking a look at the helpful email he received, no   matter what type of job you seek. ” ’   After asking the candidate for an updated résumé, four or five   times he could do a   call, and any Google contacts that   could give a positive reference, the email read: ’ ”  is a product mentor at    a candidate     platform that cuts down recruiters’ and hiring managers’ time on   the prescreening process and gathers better information about the   candidates. Recruitring is currently offering 100 free calls as   part of a trial plan. ” ’ This post was adapted from  where it was originally   published. ’ ’In August 2015, a friend of mine applied for a. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
