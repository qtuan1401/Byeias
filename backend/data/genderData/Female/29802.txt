The CEO of the Democratic National Committee has resigned after she got caught cheering on a DNC plot to use Bernie Sanders’ religion against him. The communications director and party chief financial officer also went down Tuesday. [DNC CEO Amy Dacey resigned her position Tuesday. Breitbart News extensively reported on the conflict that led to  DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s ouster in Philadelphia and her replacement by Donna Brazile, who is less equipped to run the DNC operation against Reince Priebus.  Dacey said “AMEN” to an email from DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall, who also went down hard Tuesday. Luis Miranda, communications director, also resigned in disgrace. Marshall’s email read: It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist. Dacey’s “AMEN” may have just spelled her doom. Politico reports: Democratic National Committee CEO Amy Dacey resigned Tuesday, sources with knowledge of the move confirm to POLITICO. Dacey is the first senior aide to depart in the wake of last week’s dump of hacked emails to WikiLeaks, though she follows the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on the eve of the Democratic convention. Other senior aides have been expecting the axe to fall on them too, and there’s a chill around the offices just off Capitol Hill as staffers wait for more resignations or firings. However, many people in the building had not been alerted to Dacey’s departure before the news broke.
