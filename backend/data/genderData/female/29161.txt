On Tuesday Pope Francis paid an unannounced visit to several of the towns hardest hit by an earthquake that struck central Italy in late August, killing nearly 300 people. [The Pope’s first stop was Amatrice, a town that was laid to waste by the August 24 quake and its aftershocks. Francis visited an improvised school building and met with students there, before heading on to the “red zone” —  the hardest hit area that is   to the public and still considered dangerous.  #PopeFrancis greets more than 100 school children at #Amatrice #PapaFrancesco #solidarity #mercy pic. twitter.   —   Greg Burke (@GregBurkeRome) October 4, 2016,  Pope Francis said that he wanted to visit the area to pay tribute to the victims and give support to the population. On his return trip from Azerbaijan Sunday he had announced his desire to visit the towns in a   way, but hadn’t revealed when he would do so. “I didn’t want to be a bother, so I let a bit of time pass. I am here just to tell you I am close to you and I pray for you,” the Pope told the local citizens Tuesday.
