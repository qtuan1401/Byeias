’  ’ ”   In my opinion, real estate is the best way to grow wealth. If you   want to get super rich, get involved in real estate  —   but I’m not   talking about just any real estate. ” ”   I recently wrote an article that explained why . A home is not an   investment, because it doesn’t pay you each month  —   you have to   pay it. ” ”   It’s a liability to me, not an asset. Not only does a house leave   you less mobile, it ties up your money so you can’t use it for   real assets. ” ’   There are many indications that   apartment   investments will continue to be great: ’ ”   Your initial challenge is getting a down payment. Once you do,   it’s easier to get a loan on a   unit than any other   piece of real estate.   is the easiest way to get rich   once you’re in the game. I can  and find a   property   priced at $35, 000 per unit with an 8% cap (the return on   investment based on the income a property is projected   to create) for $1, 750, 000. ” ’   If you pay cash for this deal at $1, 750, 000, you would make   $140, 000 free cashflow per year after expenses. With   $450, 000 down and financing $1, 300, 000, the debt payment would be   $78, 000 per year. This would make you $62, 000 cash flow per   year. This cannot be done with a home. ’ ”   I had a guy call in on my show,  and tell me he owned $100, 000 equity in a     house with a family of five. I quickly   searched online to find a property for this caller and came   across a $179, 000,   building with a 15% cap rate. He would   pay $48, 000 per year on the mortgage and the return would be   $22, 000 per year. He’s paying for the house he currently lives   in, but the   building produces income over the   mortgage. ” ’   For the vast majority of people, college never leads to riches,   nor does a home. If your goal is to build up $300, 000 of equity   over 30 years, then buying a home is a way to park your money the   same way you would in a savings account or under a mattress. If   you want to leverage your money and grow wealth, buying a home is   not the way to go. ’ ’   When I was in Houston, I tried the investment housing thing. My   renter left and I had trouble filling the place again. If you   have a building with 16 units, even if a couple are vacant,   you still can make it work. The more doors, the better. ’ ”   I ended up buying my first apartments back in the early 90s, a     deal for $1. 9 million, putting $350, 000 down. I looked   for a market where they don’t allow building, and where permits   to build cost more than the existing buildings. At that time in   San Diego, it would cost $28, 000 to permit one unit. I was buying   units for $70, 000. So, to go build a new one,   it would cost $28, 000 for a piece of paper, and you hadn’t even   put a nail or a stud in a piece of cement. ” ’  ’ ’   If you go into   the right way, over the next decade   it could be the best investment of your lifetime  —   and I put   my money where my mouth is. I currently own almost 4, 000   apartments and will soon have over 5, 000. They are not building   enough   apartment buildings to keep up with demand.   On average, 770, 000 new rental households have emerged   each year since 2004, according to a 2015 article in   . ’ ’     investing can give you the ability to use debt  —     a $400, 000 purchase can be purchased for 25% of the price,   allowing you to leverage $100, 000 to control 4X the value in   property.   real estate investments can also   provide excellent appreciation in value. Properties usually   increase in value when the net operating income of the property   improves through rent increases and effective management of the   property. There are also tax benefits and hedges on inflation. ’ ’   If you want to get involved in   real estate, start   with a minimum of sixteen units, avoid single family residences   and condos, and only buy   at one address.  ’ ’   If you struggle with producing enough income to save enough for a   significant down payment, check out  today.
