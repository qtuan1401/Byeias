On March 8, a suspect put a gun to the head of a taxi driver and demanded all his money, but failed to notice that the car directly behind the taxi was a police cruiser. [The incident occurred in Reading, Pennsylvania, around 4:30 pm.  According to ABC 7, a dash camera mounted inside the taxi captured the harrowing moments as the hooded suspect put the gun against the driver’s head and screamed, “Give me all your money man! Give me everything you got. ” As the driver dug in his pockets for money the suspect said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” and he continually demanded the driver keep his hands where they could be seen. The driver explained that he did not have much money because he just started his shift, so the gunman demanded he hand over his whole wallet and his phone. “I need it all right now if you don’t want to die,” he said. Throughout the exchange a police cruiser could be seen sitting behind the taxi. When the officer saw what was happening he turned on his lights and approached the taxi on foot, gun drawn. The officer arrested    Victor Herrea and took him jail. He was charged with “robbery and making terroristic threats,” and it was later revealed he using a pellet gun instead of a real one.
