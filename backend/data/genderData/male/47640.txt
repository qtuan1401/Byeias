’  ’ ”   President Obama’s top economic adviser does not sound   too excited about universal basic income. ” ”   In a  Jason Furman  —   the   chair of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers  —     talked about artificial intelligence and the effect it is having,   and will have, on the US economy. ” ’   And when one mentions AI, the subject of  (UBI) is often not far behind. ’ ’   UBI is more or less exactly what it sounds like: You give   every citizen a set amount of money, whether they work or not. ’ ”   But Furman, despite declaring at the top of his speech that he   worries we’re not utilizing robots and AI enough in the   US, said a solution for any future economic tension created by   the proliferation of robotics is unlikely to come in giving every   citizen money. ” ’’ ’   Furman argued that policymakers ought to first focus on the   skills, training, and    programs that can   help foster increasing employment opportunities for citizens even   in an   labor landscape. ’ ’   Additionally, Furman said both the shortfalls of our current   tax system and social assistance programs, as well as the   benefits of a universal basic income, are overstated. ’ ”   And another worry of many UBI proponents  —   that increased   automation of the workforce will enhance     inequality in the economy  —   misses the mark, in Furman’s view. ” ”   Here’s Furman (emphasis mine): ” ”   As we noted at the top, much of Furman’s speech dealt with   concerns that we’re not using AI enough to our   advantage. And that a top White House official is discussing at   length AI and the exciting opportunities created by increased   automation across our economy is, beyond any specific comment,   the biggest takeaway from this speech. ” ’   But in thinking about what problems and solutions might be on   offer for the US economy in the coming years and decades, Furman   is still very much thinking inside the box. ’ ’      ’
