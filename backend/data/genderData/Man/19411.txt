LONDON, United Kingdom  —   Given the furore about the EU referendum result from those who either didn’t vote, or couldn’t believe that the majority of the country felt different to them, you’d have thought there would have been a decent turnout at a   Union membership protest in Parliament Square today. [Alas only around 50 people turned up (fewer than huddle around during a Farage pub stop) to demand an overturning of the result of the European Union referendum.  Dear kiddies moaning over the #euref result. Try voting next time k? pic. twitter.   —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) June 25, 2016,  Data reveals that less than 36 per cent of   year olds voted in the referendum, but that hasn’t stopped them starting an online petition (far easier than getting up and going to vote) to try and over turn the referendum result.
