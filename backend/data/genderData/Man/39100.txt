 (CNN) A man with a jellyfish walked into a police station.  It might sound like the start of a joke, but it’s actually the beginning of an unlikely story that recently played out in Queensland, Australia. According to a statement from local police, officers were ”all hands on deck” when an unidentified man walked into Maroochydore police station on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast last week. He was carrying a ”bagged and tagged item” that he told police could be a breast implant, which he assumed may have been evidence of a homicide or drowning.  As it turned out, police confirmed that the mystery item was nothing more than a dead jellyfish. ”Investigations revealed what police suspected!” the statement said. This may be one crime drama that was over before it ever really began.
