Out with the old Future No. 1, in with the new Future No. 1. This week, the prolific Atlanta rapper Future has become the first artist in the   history of the Billboard album chart to replace himself in the top spot with new    albums. “HNDRXX,” his newest, opens at No. 1 with 48, 000 sales and 93 million streams in the United States in its debut week it bumps last week’s biggest seller, “Future,” to No. 2. Both albums were released by Epic. But Ed Sheeran is hot on his trail. After releasing two singles in early January that instantly became popular on streaming services, Mr. Sheeran on Friday issued his latest album “÷” (pronounced “divide”) which looks destined for No. 1 on next week’s chart, with yet more huge streaming numbers. (The accounting week for music sales runs Friday through Thursday.) Spotify announced that around the world, songs from “÷” racked up nearly 57 million streams on its first day, a record for that service. Also on this week’s chart, Bruno Mars is No. 3 with “24K Magic” (Atlantic) the country band Little Big Town opens at No. 4 with its new album, “The Breaker” (Capitol Nashville) and the soundtrack for “Trolls” (RCA) is in fifth place.
