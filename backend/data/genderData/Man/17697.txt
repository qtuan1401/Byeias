Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” host Judge Jeanine Pirro reacted to the FBI’s closed investigation of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen despite strong evidence he was a threat, saying the government is in no “position to help. ”  “Our government is simply not doing enough with the information that it has. Federal agencies don’t always share information with local law enforcement unless there’s a joint terrorist task force,” Pirro said. “Even then, agency competition and all that goes with it hurts the investigations. Laws must be changed. We saw it when the FBI investigated the Boston bombers, and we’re too blind to connect the dots where homeland security simply allowed Tamerlan Tsarnaev to fly back and forth to Chechnya. That same FBI interviewed Mateen, the Orlando shooter, three times. Mateen told them his   comments were simply a response to what he perceived as   comments. He was turning the tables on us, folks, while basically tapping into our politically correct, Islamophobic guilt. Part of the reason for closing his case was that Mateen was a security guard. So he must be okay. Seriously?” Pirro later strongly urged Americans to get a gun for protection. “I’m telling you this again. Get a gun, because this government ain’t in a position to help,” she concluded. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
