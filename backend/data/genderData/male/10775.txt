Brad Pitt plays Gen. Dan McMahon, a parody of Afghanistan war general Stanley McChrystal, in the first teaser trailer for Netflix’s satire film War Machine. [Here’s the full synopsis from Netflix:  “A   war story for our times,   David Michôd (Animal Kingdom) recreates a U. S. General’s   rise and fall as part reality, part savage parody  —   raising the specter of just where the line between them lies today. His is an absurdist look at a born leader’s   march right into the dark heart of folly. At the story’s core is Brad Pitt’s sly take on one of the most polarizing war figures of a generation: successful, charismatic   General Stanley McChrystal, who leapt in like a rock star to command NATO forces in Afghanistan, only to be taken down by a journalist’s    exposé. ” Tilda Swinton, Ben Kingsley, Topher Grace, Will Poulter, Anthony Michael Hall and Lakeith Stanfield  . War Machine is on Netflix May 26. Watch the teaser trailer above.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
