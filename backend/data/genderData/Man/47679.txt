’  ’ ’   What do the coffee business and the cannabis business have in   common? ’ ”   As it turns out, it’s more than people might expect. ” ’   The  vaporizer is   billed as the ”Keurig of Cannabis”  —   it’’s a device that   heats marijuana to a specific temperature without burning the   plant  —   because it really is just like its     namesake.  ’ ’   It employs a similar   technology that helped   grow Keurig into the   dollar coffee empire that   it is today.  ’ ’   The CannaCloud was even designed by the same firm that created   the Keurig, Dave Manly, the chairman of CannaKorp, told Business   Insider. (CannaKorp is the company that builds the   CannaCloud).  ’ ”   Manly is also a former Keurig executive and was one of the   prime architects of Keurig’s astounding growth. He joined Keurig   in 2002 when it was doing only $25 million in revenue, after   a stint at Procter & Gamble.  ” ’   He guesses that he was probably the 25th employee at Keurig,   and by the time he left, the company had grown immensely  —   to   over $5 billion in revenue. He ended up as the head   of ”innovation” at Keurig before he   in 2014   after a successful,   stint at the company. ’ ”   And that’s when CannaKorp came calling. ” ’   ” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   Right now, there are prototype CannaClouds available for show,   and they’re in the middle of manufacturing the first batch of   product in China. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Manly said that he sees the CannaCloud going beyond dispensaries,   and into pharmacies.  ’ ’   ”It’’s the perfect consumer product to have on a shelf,” Manly   said. ”I’’m a consumer product guy. My vantage point is we’’re   going to make our product very approachable and very easy to   buy.” ’
