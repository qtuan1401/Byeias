The Miami Dolphins hired Adam Gase as its new head coach on Saturday. [The Chicago Bears offensive coordinator figured as a sought after figure this offseason as a result of the resurgence of Jay Cutler under his tutelage. His reputation as a coach with a feel for quarterbacks makes him a good fit in Miami, which enjoys the services of a talented passer in Ryan Tannehill but does not enjoy the fruits that normally come with that.  The Dolphins finished   this season, missing the playoffs for the seventh straight year. The franchise fired head coach Joe Philbin after a rough start. Replacement Dan Campbell, who improved the team with a   record, interviewed for the job, as did Doug Marrone, Mike Shanahan, and several others. Gase comes into the job with no head coaching experience at any level of football. At 37, the Michigan    Gase becomes the youngest head coach in the National Football League. The Miami Dolphins once appeared as the epitome of coaching stability. Don Shula coached the team from 1970 to 1995. In the two decades since, the team has employed ten different head coaches.
