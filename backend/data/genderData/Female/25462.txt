Gun crime convictions are down more than 33 percent compared to a decade ago, but the Obama administration’s gun control push has risen sharply. [In fact, Politico reports that next week, Obama is expected to announce executive gun control to broaden background checks and put new regulations on licensed gun sellers.  According to The Washington Times, gun crime convictions “[peaked] at 9, 206 a decade ago” —  under George W. Bush —  but fell “to 6, 002 in fiscal year 2015. ” And one reason for the lower number of convictions is that prosecutors “are simply bringing fewer cases” under Obama. For example, “Of the two most common federal gun offenses —  illegally selling a firearm or using one in connection with another crime —  the number of cases dropped from 11, 067 in 2004 to 8, 078 in 2014. ” According to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) Reports, annual gun crime convictions under Obama have never matched the number of convictions secured under Bush in 2008 —  and 2008 was not even Bush’s best year for securing convictions. The number of convictions in 2008 topped 8, 000. Obama has only had two years with over 7, 000 convictions, and the rest of his annual numbers were in the 6, 000 range. Yet the gun control push is relentless. In addition to the highly anticipated executive gun control —  coming next week —  Obama has been calling on Congress to expand background checks, add the   list to current gun controls, and ban the sale of “assault weapons,” which Obama calls “weapons of war. ” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
