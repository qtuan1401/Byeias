’  ’ ”   After months of rumors, Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA    on Tuesday a bond swap for $7 billion in   outstanding debt to help alleviate some of the company’s   financial stresses. ” ”   Eulogio del Pino, the company’s president and Venezuela’s oil   minister, said the swap would allow investors to trade PDVSA   notes due in October 2016, April 2017, and November 2017 in for   new bonds that will mature in 2020, according to the . ” ’   And, notably, the swap is voluntary, meaning that whether or not   this works depends at least partially on the participation of   investors. ’ ’   ”If the government can persuade existing PDVSA bondholders to   participate that will be positive for other bondholders as it   might remove the   risk of default,” argued the analysts   at Exotix Partners in a note to clients. ’ ’   ”It would push back up to US$6bn of bond payments over the next   18 months and buy some breathing space, to allow time to   implement reforms (and the recall vote),” they added. ’ ”   However, the bond swap won’t be the end of Venezuela’s problems.   As Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics,   explained in a note to clients: ” ’   Against the backdrop of this, Venezuela is currently teetering on   the edge of political and economic disaster, plagued   by economic mismanagement, a chronic balance of   payments problem,  and . ’ ’  ’ ’      ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Against this backdrop, the country’’s economic crisis will rumble   on and there remains a high chance of a sovereign default over   the medium term,” concluded Glossop. ’
