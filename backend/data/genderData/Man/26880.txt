The latest guest on the Milo Yiannopoulos show is professional hunter, businessman, and reality television star Phil Robertson. The pair sat down to discuss issues of faith, free speech, and his upcoming movie.[  On the topic of his faith and how he ended up doing his reality TV show Duck Dynasty, Robertson said that “you love your God, you love your neighbour, you do what is right. I just don’t see the downside to that. ” He explained that the show was a means of showing this. “Humans tend to forget easily how cruel they can be to one another, and when we start determining what life is worth, what’s good and what’s evil, what’s right and wrong, when humans determine that, it never turns out well,” he said. “You have to have some kind of standout you rely on, and in my case, it is God and the Bible. ” Giving his thoughts on the upcoming election, Robertson said that “originally I looked at the list and who was a strict constitutionalist and I thought Ted Cruz. He’s a bible man. But it didn’t work out for him. ” “I then looked at the other side and thought we have a socialist. They keep trying it [socialism] and it never works out,” Robertson said. “Once you allow these totalitarian regimes to take hold, what Bernie Sanders is propagating, it never works at well as they’ll stand over you, then loathe the day they gave away a constitutional republic and went that way. ” “As a Republican, I’m going with the man the Republican party sends,” he stated.
