Chris Froome punches fan during Stage 8 of #TDF2016 https:  .  During the eighth stage of the Tour de France on Saturday, cyclist Chris Froome fended off a fan running alongside him by smacking him in the face.  The fan, wearing a Colombia soccer jersey and sporting a big sign and a yellow wig, got too close for comfort, Froome later said. Froome told the Associated Press after the stage: “I have absolutely nothing against the Colombian fans. They bring great (spirit) to the race. But this guy in particular was running right next to my handlebars. He had a flag that was flying out behind him and it was just getting dangerous so I pushed him away. I lashed out and pushed him away. ” Froome went on to win the stage, but was fined 200 Swiss francs (about $203). Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
