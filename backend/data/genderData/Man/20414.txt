A reader has   Breitbart News an image showing a graffiti mural reading “KILL MORE COPS” along Interstate 5 in Los Angeles, a major commuting route in the San Fernando Valley just north of Burbank and Hollywood. [According to an   from the reader, who took a photo of the graffiti in the midst of traffic, “It is right at the Sheldon exit, northbound side of the 5 freeway near van nuys CA. I have seen it for the last 3 days but not sure when it was first up. It is on a fence next to another wall. ”  The graffiti comes in the wake of several murders of police officers, associated with the Black Lives Matter movement. Earlier this month, five Dallas Police Department officers were killed by a sniper at a Black Lives Movement rally. A week ago, three more officers were killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Baton Rouge had seen intense protests after police shot and killed a black man, Alton Sterling, who had allegedly been threatening a homeless man at a convenience store, and who had been wrestled to the ground at the time he was shot, where he allegedly reached for his gun as officers tried to subdue him. Los Angeles has a particularly sensitive history with hostility toward police, following the videotaped beating of a black motorist, Rodney King, in 1991 and the subsequent riots in 1992 when officers were acquitted. Recently, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has faced scrutiny and protest over several deaths at the hands of police, including that of Ezell Ford and Redel Jones. Mayor Eric Garcetti has, in contrast to several other mayors, offered unequivocal support for law enforcement during the past few tumultuous weeks. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
