Facebook has once again shown that it will not tolerate rhetoric criticizing Muslim immigration after it temporarily blocked talk show host Michael Savage after he posted a story about a Muslim migrant murdering a pregnant woman in Germany. [Savage, who is known for his conservative views, shared a story of how a Syrian migrant hacked a pregnant woman to death with a machete, whilst also injuring two other people.  As a result, Facebook sent Savage a message that he had “recently posted something that violates Facebook policies, so you’re temporarily blocked from using this feature. ” It was based on Facebook’s Community Standards guidelines which lists “hate speech” as something the site will seek to stamp out. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously agreed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s demands to crack down on any criticism of the country’s immigration policy on the social network.   Facebook has also tried to reassure investors that the site does not have an   bias by inviting a range of establishment conservatives for a “discussion” about the reported suppression of conservative content.
