Monday on Newsmax TV’s “The Steve Malzburg Show,” while discussing the FBI investigation of Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton’s handling of  classified material on an unsecured server during her tenure as secretary of state and possible charges, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said President Barack Obama would face   resignations if he attempted to block a recommended indictment.  Mukasey said, “I have confidence in the FBI. I have confidence in people at the Justice Department, some of them, at any rate, who are involved in this investigation —  that is people in the national security division. It’s less a matter of confidence than it is a matter of believing that people, out of   would not want to be seen to be sweeping this under the rug. ” When host Malzberg asked if Obama could protect Clinton, Mukasey said, “The fact is that the president can direct the attorney general not to bring charges. The attorney general works for the president and the president can order that   …     Although I can’t believe that you wouldn’t get people resigning in the wake of something like that, the same way that we did at the time of Watergate. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
