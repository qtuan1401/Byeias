Breitbart News previously reported Manville High School senior Frank Harvey’s claim that the police were called to question him and he was ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation because of his   control project. At issue was a video Harvey made to emphasize the fact that criminals do not follow laws, therefore, more gun control only constrains   citizens. [The video was discovered on a   Harvey accidentally left in a school library computer. It shows that criminals get guns illegally —  regardless of the law —  and he contrasted this with stories that highlight   citizens’ need to be able to keep and bear arms for defense of themselves and their families.  The video also mocks the idea that “liberals” pretend criminals are hindered by “gun free zone” signage.  Harvey’s video tells the story of a criminal who acquired his gun illegally and was later “convicted of murder in the first degree. ” Text in the video says: We can establish that because criminals do not follow laws they therefore would be able to obtain a gun even if laws were established to prevent   citizens from obtaining guns. Preventing   citizens from obtaining guns only makes [the criminal’s] “job” easier, as the   citizens are now unable to protect themselves from criminals who obtain guns illegally anyway. He tells the story of “a father in Texas who was   to defend his home” when three home invaders struck in July 2013. The father “[sent] two of them to thief heaven after the fatal mistake of breaking into the wrong home. ” Harvey observes, “So, who is the real insane one here? The   citizen who owns a gun to protect himself and his family, or the Liberal who wishes to take that right away?” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
