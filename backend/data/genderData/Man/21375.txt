A man in New York has been charged with manslaughter after brutally attacking the man who attempted to rape his wife Monday, says a WGNTV report.  According to police, a man entered the    womanâ€™s apartment while asking for water, struck her and attempted to rape her, causing bruising on her forehead and her clothes to be ripped. The woman was able to alert her husband, Mamadou Diallo, of the attack with her cell phone. Diallo eventually entered the apartment as the attack was still happening. He punched the attempted rapist, identified as Earl D. Nash, multiple times. Police found Nash with severe body and head trauma. He was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.
