Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey said Tuesday at a press conference that he will not recommend an indictment against Hillary Clinton, though he found “evidence” that she might have violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information. [Comey announced a number of conclusions that support the findings of Breitbart News’ coverage of the Clinton private email scandal, including that she sent and received information on her private server that was classified. Comey said that 110 of Clinton’s emails were classified at the time they were sent.  Comey said that “although there is evidence of potential violations,” no reasonable prosecutor would take on the case. Comey at least shared details about that damning evidence. He also said that seven of Clinton’s email chains contained “Top Secret” information. “That is excluding any later   emails  …     None of these emails should have been on any unclassified system, but the presence of these emails is especially concerning,” Comey said. “There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position  …     should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that information,” Comey continued. “There is evidence that they were extremely careless,” he said, referring to Clinton and her aides. Comey also noted that individuals in a similar situation would not necessarily be let off the hook with no charges, but would probably face penalties. “But that’s not what we’re deciding now,” Comey said. “We are expressing to Justice our view that no charges be made in this case. ” Comey said that “no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear” on the investigation, even though Attorney General Loretta Lynch recently held a secret meeting with President Bill Clinton. Comey said the investigation was conducted in an “apolitical and professional way  …     I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization. ” Then he walked off.
