’  ’ ’   YouTube has entered the growing field of companies trying to   disrupt traditional cable providers with a new paid TV service   that streams over the internet. ’ ”   On Tuesday, YouTube formally unveiled YouTube TV, its answer to   similar services like Dish’s SlingTV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now, and   Sony’s PlayStation Vue. (Hulu is expected to launch its own live   TV service later this year.) ” ’   It will cost $35 per month and there are no contracts, so you can   cancel whenever you want. YouTube also has a virtual DVR service   with unlimited storage, but shows will automatically delete after   nine months. YouTube TV will launch in a few months in the US. ’ ”   There are no plans yet for an international launch, but don’t   hold your breath if you live outside the US. ” ”   YouTube TV includes all four major broadcast networks, CBS, ABC,   NBC, and Fox, but won’t have channels from Viacom or Turner. ” ’’ ’   Sorry, ”Walking Dead” fans, there’’s no AMC either. But you will   get sports networks like ESPN. ’ ”   It will also give you access to YouTube’s original programming   previously available only on the company’s Red subscription   service. ” ”   Like other similar services, you’ll be able to stream YouTube TV   to pretty much any device with a screen and internet connection:   connected TVs and   boxes, phones, tablets, and computers.   But for TVs, you’ll be able to stream only if you have a   Chromecast or a Google   TV for now. The app will   likely launch on other devices like video game consoles, Apple   TV, and Roku in the future. ” ’   YouTube TV also works with Google Home, the new connected speaker   from Google, so you can use your voice to tell it what you want   to watch. ’ ’   And, you guessed it, YouTube TV is designed for millennials who   are used to watching TV online instead of on traditional cable. ’ ’   ”Millennials love great TV content, but they don’t want to watch   it in the traditional setting,” YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said   at YouTube TV’’s launch event in LA on Tuesday. ’ ’   Interested?
