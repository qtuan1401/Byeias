’  ’ ’   During a press conference this week, Philippine President Rodrigo   Duterte again inveighed against the US, capping his rant by   directing one his most frequently used insults against the   British journalist who questioned him. ’ ’   ”You did raise earlier the comparison with Latin America and   narcostate,” Jonathan Miller, the Asia correspondent for the UK’’s   Channel 4,  to Duterte in the president’’s hometown   of Davao City in Mindanao in the southern Philippines. ’ ’   ”The narcostates of Latin America were, as you know, associated   with the term ’’death squads’’ too, and . .. in the five months   since you became president, more people have actually been killed   than died during the nine years of the Marcos dictatorship . ..”   Miller  before Duterte started to answer. ’ ’   The Philippine president then made several criticisms of the US,   which he has frequently denounced. ’ ’   ”I could ask the same question. Why is America losing 40, 000   lives [in]   cases. What makes the Philippines   different from America?” Duterte began his response, which you   can see in full below, as  by The Philippine Star. ’ ’ ’ ’   Duterte made several critiques of the US, including over the   invasions of Panama and Iraq and its nonmembership in the   International Criminal Court. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
