Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” when asked about President Barack Obama saying she did not put national security at risk when using a private email sever during her tenure as secretary of state, Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton echoed Obama’s claim.  Clinton said, “I have not spoken to him. I appreciate what he said, of course, I never endangered national security. That’s absolutely false. I said it was a mistake. It wasn’t the best choice. And now we know, Colin Powell had a private   account. Aides to Condi Rice. I think that what’s going on will be resolved. And obviously, all of us will go forward knowing what we now know. Making sure that no one can raise any questions in the future. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
