Three Mexican nationals have been charged with transporting and harboring five illegal aliens across the U. S.  Border. [Luis Cesar   32 Alvaro   27 and Giovanni   21, all of whom are illegal immigrants, are accused of holding others at their   residence, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) news release.  After ICE agents responded to a complaint, they found the trio at a house which they claimed was their residence. In a back room, ICE agents found five illegal immigrants who had their shoes taken from them. Two of the five illegal immigrants found told ICE they were walking through Texas near the southern border for multiple days when   and   picked them up in a white truck. The charges also claim that the three illegal immigrant Mexican nationals “guarded” the other five, taking their shoes and a phone. Further, the charges accuse   of threatening at least one with a rifle. ICE agents also discovered three firearms, a stolen rifle, and documents filled with names, dollar amounts, and locations. The white   truck allegedly used to transport the illegal immigrants was found at the residence as well. The vehicle was reported stolen in October 2016. ICE says the five illegal immigrants are nationals of Mexico, El Salvador, and Honduras. Altogether, the eight individuals are being held at the Houston Immigration Service Processing Center and face potential deportation. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.
