CBS aired an updated version of “The Catch” where San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Dwight Clark came down with Joe Montana’s   pass to dethrone the Dallas Cowboys in the 1982 NFC Championship Game.  This time, “The Catch” was done out of an airplane. The ball traveled significantly more than the original   pass from Montana and was done with the players parachuting into the stadium and fighting off defenders into the end zone.
