’  ’ ’   After being  off the   coast of Yemen, the USS Mason, a guided missile destroyer, fired   two missiles in defense. ’ ’   The USS Mason fired missiles defending itself and the USS Ponce,   an amphibious dock ship, after it detected inbound cruise   missiles presumably fired from Houthi militants on shore in   Yemen. ’ ”   This follows an October 1 incident where a former US Navy ship,   the United Arab Emirates’ HSV Swift, sustained severe damages   from a guided missile fired from Yemen. In the case of the HSV   Swift, the Houthis claimed responsibility. ” ’   The Mason launched two Standard   ( ) and a Enhanced   Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) to intercept the two inbound missiles,   also deploying a     decoy, at around 7 pm   local time, sources told USNI News. ’ ’  ’ ”   While the Mason did fire defensive missiles and the incoming   missiles didn’t hit their target, it’s not clear if the   did   their job, or if the incoming missile, likely a 1990s vintage     cruise missile supplied to Houthi militants by Iran,   simply sputtered out and hit the water of its own accord. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
