”   If you’ve been keeping up with the rumors surrounding Apple’s   next iPhone, you’ll know that Apple could be announcing three new   iPhones this year. ” ’   That could include the two S models of the iPhone 7, as well as a     third option, which is said to be an ” ”   and more expensive model with a fresh design and special   features, one of which could be an OLED display. ’ ’  ’ ’   The Japanese news site  recently claimed with confidence that Apple’’s third   ” ” model would come with an OLED display. ’ ”   But when will those fancy new screens become the norm? The latest   iPhone rumor suggests that all the iPhones that Apple   will release in 2019 will have OLED displays, according to the   Korean news site  citing sources in Apple’s supply chain. ” ’  ’ ’   iPhones with OLED screens are an exciting prospect. For one, OLED   screens display richer colors, better contrast, and better   brightness than LCD screens to make anything on the screen look   very good. ’ ”   Secondly, OLED screens are also more   than their   LCD counterparts, which could lead to better battery life. That’s   because OLED screens turn off parts of the screen that are   displaying the color black, whereas LCD screens are always on,   even when displaying black. ” ’  ’ ”   The good news for iPhone fans is that they wouldn’t have to shell   out as much cash for an OLED iPhone in 2019. ” ’   Meanwhile, Samsung and other Android smartphone fans have enjoyed   some form of OLED displays for quite some time now. The first   Galaxy S smartphone, for example, which was released in 2010, had   a Super AMOLED display. ’ ”   Remember to refrain from taking these rumors as fact. Every   detail about the upcoming iPhones is only a rumor so far. We’ll   know the details only when Apple announces its iPhone during its   event in September  —   and as for the 2019 iPhone lineup, we’re   still two years away. ” ”If you’ve been keeping up with the rumors. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
