Columnist Charles Krauthammer argued Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s latest email defense is “reminiscent of her reaction with the beginning of the Lewinsky scandal, when they denied the truth and she said this is the vast   conspiracy” on Wednesday’s “Special Report” on the Fox News Channel.  Krauthammer stated, “I’m just shocked by the brazenness of her denial. For her to say today, I ‘never sent or received’  —   because, remember, earlier she said, ‘I never sent,’ which allows you to do a Clintonian and what is is, and say, ‘Well, I wasn’t talking about receiving.’ She clearly  —   the IG had reported, this is several, many, of the absolutely highest top secret. And it’s reminiscent of her reaction with the beginning of the Lewinsky scandal, when they denied the truth and she said this is the vast   conspiracy. The   initial answer always is to brazenly say a lie, there was no relationship, and then for her to come in and to say this is just imagination or cunning on the other part, or a malevolent conspiracy. She does it again, in the face of an IG, who clearly is not an agent of the Republicans. So,  —   but I don’t think it hurts her among democrats. I think it hurts her among the general population, the general election, and, again, I think it all depends on the head of the FBI. Either he does a referral, or he doesn’t. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
