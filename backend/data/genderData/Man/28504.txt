On January 4 Breitbart News spoke with Senator Rand Paul about his ongoing defense of the Second Amendment and his efforts to fight against Obama’s penchant for using executive actions for gun control. [Paul pointed out his concern that Obama’s method of attacking gun rights ends up isolating the Second Amendment, making it seem like the protections on the right to keep and bear arms are really outside of normal constitutional protections.  Paul countered this view by saying, “The Second Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights and it is as important as the rest of the Bill of Rights. It is not some odd duckling out there. And the media, I don’t think, would be reporting Obama’s actions the same way if, by executive order, he was going to make journalists register. ” Paul added: In fact, if Obama was planning infringement of the First Amendment, the media would be going crazy. But we should never let any president abbreviate any part of the Bill of Rights. No matter what amendment it is, we should never allow it to be abbreviated by executive order. Regarding the executive gun control which Obama will announce January 5, Paul said, “I’m going to fight him tooth and nail. ” Paul said he will push within his caucus to get a vote on the legislation he proposed in December  —   legislation which would reduce executive gun control to “advisory only. ” On December 21 The Hill reported that Paul’s legislation would apply to “any execution action on gun control that either infringes upon congressional authority or potentially violates the Second Amendment. ” And once labeled “advisory only,” the action would require Congressional passage before it could take effect.
