’  ’ ’   Snapchat’’s parent company, Snap Inc. is aiming to raise ”as much   as $4 billion” when it goes public early next year, according to   a  from Bloomberg’’s Alex Barinka and Sarah   Frier. ’ ’   A source previously told Business Insider that Snap plans to go   public  but now   Bloomberg is saying that number could swell as high as $35   billion or even $40 billion. ’ ’ while   JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Co. Barclays, and Credit   Suisse will be joint bookrunners. ’ ’   The Los   company last raised $1. 81 billion in   private funding in May, which pegged its valuation at between $18   billion and $22 billion. ’ ”   Raising $4 billion on the public market would put Snap well   behind Facebook’s $16 billion IPO raise in 2012 and ahead of   Twitter’s $1. 82 billion in 2013. ” ’’ ’   Snap has told investors that it expects to make between $250   million and $350 million in advertising revenue this year. A    predicted the company would near $1   billion in revenue in 2017  —   meaning an IPO that valued the   company at $35 billion would be 35 times its projected revenue   numbers. ’ ’   By comparison, Facebook was estimated to make $5 billion in ad   revenue the same year it went public at a $104 billion valuation. ’ ’   With annual revenue under $1 billion now, Snap could file its   Form   with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the   JOBS Act. In such a scenario, the initial filing would be   confidential. ’ ”   Snap wasn’t immediately available to comment. ”
