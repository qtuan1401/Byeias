’  ’ ’   Police officers could soon be adding a new weapon to their   arsenal:   drones. ’ ”   The idea of police using drones equipped with stun guns to catch   criminals isn’t all that  . Stun gun maker Taser   International has already approached some law enforcement   officials about potentially using weaponized drones during   encounters with civilians,  reported Thursday. ” ’   Although police are just beginning to explore the use of such   drones, the implications have prompted questions surrounding   public safety and civil liberties. ’ ’   “Many people are going to be concerned that if you can put a   Taser on one, what’s going to prevent you from putting a firearm   on,” Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation and a   retired police chief, told The Journal. ’ ’   ”The idea for a community to accept an unmanned vehicle that’s   got some sort of weapon on it might be a hurdle to overcome,”   said Pete Simpson, a spokesman for the Portland police   department. ’ ’’ ’   Despite this, police use of robotic technology to deal with   suspects is not without precedent. In July, the Dallas Police   Department used a robot outfitted with explosives to kill a   gunman who had shot and killed five police officers. It was the   first time  to kill a suspect. ’ ’   The practicality of these drones is also unknown because, as Mark   Lomax, executive director of the National Tactical Officers   Association said, “It’s very hard to envision flying at 50 feet   in the air and this thing’s moving and the person’s moving  —   it   could be hard to tase them.” ’ ’ ’
