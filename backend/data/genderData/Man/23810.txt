Emily Smith reports in the New York Post that the “Clinton political dynasty” isn’t “dead” yet. Daughter Chelsea Clinton is reportedly “being groomed” to run for the Congressional seat currently occupied by    career politician Rep. Nita Lowey, whose 17th Congressional District happens to include Bill and Hillary Clinton’s home in Chappaqua, New York. [From the New York Post:  In August, Hillary and Bill Clinton purchased a home next door to their primary residence in Chappaqua for $1. 16 million, which is intended for Chelsea, her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and their two children, Charlotte and Aidan. While Chelsea currently lives, and is registered to vote, in Manhattan, she could easily make Chappaqua her legal residence in order to run for Lowey’s seat when it becomes vacant. A source told us, “While it is true the Clintons need some time to regroup after Hillary’s crushing loss, they will not give up. Chelsea would be the next extension of the Clinton brand. In the past few years, she has taken a very visible role in the Clinton Foundation and on the campaign trail. While politics isn’t the life Hillary wanted for Chelsea, she chose to go on the campaign trail for her mother and has turned out to be very poised, articulate and comfortable with the visibility. ” The source continued, “There has been a lot of speculation within New York Democratic circles about Lowey’s retirement and Chelsea running for the seat. There is a belief that Chappaqua is a logical place for Chelsea to run, because it would be straightforward for her to raise money and build a powerful base. ” Read the rest here.
