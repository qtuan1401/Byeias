 (CNN) Michelle Dockery is going from the abbey to the wild west.  The ”Downton Abbey” star has been cast in producer Steven Soderbergh’s forthcoming Netflix series ”Godless,” CNN has confirmed. The series follows the story of an outlaw (Jeff Daniels) who’s hunting down his mortal enemy.  Dockery will play a character named Alice Fletcher, a resident in a sleepy and mysterious   town. This role will be Dockery’s second TV gig since ”Downton Abbey” took its bow in 2015. She will also star as a con artist in a TNT drama called ”Good Behavior” this fall.  ”Godless,” announced back in March, reunites Soderbergh with his ”Out of Sight” writer Scott Frank.  Soderbergh is on a bit of a roll when it comes to his television projects. His other recent TV credits include Amazon’s ”Red Oaks,” Cinemax’s ”The Knick,” and ”The Girlfriend Experience” on Starz. ”Godless” will premiere in 2017.
