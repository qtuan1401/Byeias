During his Wednesday morning appearance on Breitbart News Daily, on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 with hosts Stephen K. Bannon and Alex Marlow, veteran political strategist Pat Caddell said of Hillary Clinton, “I think she has probably as deep a credibility problem as has ever existed at the presidential level. ”[Caddell cited a recent Quinnipiac poll from earlier this week on how people viewed the candidates on specific issues: “Almost   of the American people said she wouldn’t even try, i. e. she is not telling us the truth” on at least two of her signature issues.  Hillary Clinton would not even try to remove secret money from politics, 63 percent of voters say, while 9 percent say she would succeed and 18 percent say she would try and fail. She also would not try to curb the power of Wall Street, 56 percent of voters say, as 15 percent say she would succeed and 21 percent say she would try and fail. Caddell also expressed outrage “over the Associated Press prematurely declaring the Democratic presidential primary over, and coronating Hillary Clinton as the nominee, before Tuesday night’s important votes were cast. ” “I have to tell you, somebody’s got to say that what the AP did, in announcing that she had won, the nomination was over, on the eve of the voting of these seven primaries, was so irresponsible an act,” Caddell said. “And it was a purposefully irresponsible act, in my opinion. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
