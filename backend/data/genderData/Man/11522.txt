Virgin Atlantic have evacuated a flight from Dubai to Heathrow as a “precautionary measure” following a bomb threat. [“Our customers travelling on the VS401 from Dubai to London Heathrow have temporarily disembarked the aircraft for additional security checks,” a spokesman told the International Business Times.  “This is purely as a precautionary measure as the safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority and we’re planning to have everyone on their way as quickly as possible. ” Passengers have reportedly been advised they must undergo full body scans before reembarking, although some are said to demanding a change of flight. “We were just moving and then the captain called his flight crew immediately and they all ran up the front,” a passenger told MailOnline. “Ten minutes later we were told to get off. ” They described how “the captain just came out and said Virgin take[s] the safety of passengers very seriously  —   following the events in Manchester, Virgin had received a bomb threat so as [a] precaution they have asked everyone to leave the plane. ” Late on Monday night, a suicide bomber targeted    —   including many young girls  —   leaving the Manchester Arena. Eyewitnesses reported “there were bodies scattered about everywhere” and police have reported 22 dead and 59 injured so far.
