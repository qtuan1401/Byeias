 (CNN) He’s a working dad whose career is flying: Prince William is taking to the air as a newly qualified air ambulance pilot, while trying to keep his feet on the ground. Second in line to the British throne, William started work Monday as a pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance service. He’ll be flying rescue missions for four counties around Cambridge, where he’ll be based. Cambridge is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of London. ”For me it’s really important to be grounded. I feel doing a job like this really helps with grounding . .. at the core of what I am trying to become,” he said in an interview Monday. And what he wants to become is    in his words    ”a good guy,” ”a decent individual.” He said he wants to balance his career with his royal duties, which, at some point, will inevitably take over. He’ll be working   his office said Monday, ideally in blocks of several weeks, with his royal duties sandwiched into a week at a time. The Prince also has a young family to worry about, the newest member of which is Princess Charlotte, who was christened July 5. ”She’s been a little joy of heaven but at the same time, it is more responsibility looking after two little ones, especially when (her older brother) George is around,” William said. ”He’s a little monkey. But it’s fantastic having a little family. I’m so thrilled. Catherine has been doing an amazing job as a mother and I’m very proud of her.” Buckingham Palace says William won’t get special treatment, except being released for official duties.  He’ll be paid a regular wage that he’s donating to charity. The palace declined to name either the salary or the charity.
