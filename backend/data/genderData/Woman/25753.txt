Jim Hanson, the Executive Vice President at the Center for Security Policy, discussed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow the recent Islamic State terror attack in Turkey, in which a suicide bomber between 12 and    killed over 50 people at a wedding. [“It’s an obscenity, but unfortunately right in ISIS’s sweet spot,” Hanson said. “They’ve used people with mental problems. They’ve used children. They’ve used women. And unfortunately, they also have people who are also perfectly willing to do this. But in this case, it looks like this kid was packed with a suicide vest and detonated by remote control. ”  Added Hanson: The women they hold under their control, whether willingly, or unwillingly, have also been used. The advantage they have with a woman, if they got ’em in one of the burka potato sacks, you can hide the suicide vest. You know, you can’t even tell it’s there. So, it’s even easier to camouflage this and women get  less scrutiny in Islamist areas. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
