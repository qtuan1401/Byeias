A chalk slogan bearing the words “Free Milo” was spotted outside Twitter’s corporate headquarters in San Francisco last night, the latest addition to a collection of chalkings spotted around the world calling for Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos to be unbanned on Twitter. [Pictures of the chalking show the slogan drawn onto the iconic bricked pavement where Twitter’s San Francisco office is located, and searching the location on Google Maps will reveal the street adorned with gay pride rainbow flags, adding an extra layer of irony to the situation.  Similar chalkings were spotted outside Twitter’s Dublin office today, as well as Twitter’s LA office on Sunday, while another #FreeMilo chalk slogan was also discovered on one of the Hollywood Walk of Fame’s empty stars. Since Yiannopoulos’ permanent suspension from Twitter, #FreeMilo chalk slogans have also been spotted outside of the Pulse gay club in Orlando, Florida, where over 50 patrons were massacred in an Islamic terror attack last month, and one family of patriotic Muslims even chalked the slogan onto their   Mosque in Fargo, North Dakota as a statement of solidarity with Yiannopoulos after the ban. Yiannopoulos was permanently suspended from the platform after engaging in a spat with Ghostbusters (2016) actress Leslie Jones, who remains unsuspended from the platform despite breaking the site’s terms of service for inciting mob abuse.
