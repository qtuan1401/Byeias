Justin Bieber got into a good   fistfight after the   NBA Finals game on Wednesday  —   and, to his credit, the “Love Yourself” singer actually appeared to land a punch prior to getting socked in the face by his much larger opponent. [According to TMZ, Bieber was outside his hotel in downtown Cleveland around 11 p. m. Wednesday night when he and the much bigger guy got in each other’s faces. The unnamed man took a swing at Bieber, and Bieber connected back with his own punch.  But the bigger guy quickly and clearly gained the upper hand in the brawl, as it ends with Bieber on his back. It wasn’t immediately clear what sparked the brawl. The    singer later posted a selfie to Twitter to reassure fans that he hadn’t scratched up his famous mug.

The fight was probably more exciting than the game, which the Cavaliers won in a   blowout.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
