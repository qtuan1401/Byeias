Wednesday on Newsmax TV’s “The Steve Malzberg Show,” while discussing her Benghazi investigation “Full Measure,” host Sharyl Attkisson said there is now “overwhelming” evidence that rescue teams sent to aid the U. S. consulate in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012 had turned back before arriving.  Attkisson said, “We also spoke to sources and have some email evidence that talks about special forces that were not far away in Europe that we were told were assigned to respond in the event of a case just like this, and yet were turned back according to witnesses. This is something that the president and the White House has steadfastly denied, but there’s now what I would call an overwhelming body of evidence that leads us to believe that somebody stopped a number of teams and potential rescuers from entering Libya or going to Benghazi to help while those attacks were underway. They could have gotten there. According to experts and people that have information we spoke to, they could have gotten there before the last two Americans died. Those attacks went on for eight hours. ” She added “We spoke to, again a CIA team leader expert, an   expert who says the only person who stops those forces that spun up automatically without waiting to be told —  the only force is the commander in chief,  slash the White House, an authority that comes from him. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
