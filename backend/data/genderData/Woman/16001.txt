Television star America Ferrara gave viewers a free lesson in U. S. history Tuesday night, telling an adoring crowd at the Democratic National Convention that the Founding Fathers were united in tolerance of diverse sexual orientations. [“This country was founded on the belief that what sets us apart —  race, language, religion, sexual orientation —  should not dissolve what binds us,” Ferrara declared to applause.  The star of “Ugly Betty” went on to explain that she owed her exceptional knowledge of American history to the public school system. “I am profoundly grateful for the access and opportunity that exists in this extraordinary nation. I was educated in public schools. My talents were nurtured through public arts programs,” she said. Despite Ms. Ferrara’s convictions to the contrary, the United States was not founded on the belief that differences in race, language, religion and sexual orientation “should not dissolve what binds us. ” In all thirteen original colonies, sodomy was a capital offense, following the English tradition that made it a capital felony for any person to “commit the detestable and abominable vice of buggery with mankind or beast. ” Eventually the harsh sentence of death was mitigated and in Pennsylvania’s “An Act Amending the Penal Laws” (1786) a provision was included that anyone convicted of “robbery, burglary, sodomy, or buggary” should suffer, not death, but the forfeit of all his lands and goods and servitude for a term “not exceeding ten years. ” And despite the fact that many of the American founders did, in fact, wear wigs, none would have thought of himself as a crossdresser. Ms. Ferrara shared the stage with Lena Dunham, the creator of “Girls,” who posed as a “sexual assault survivor,” completing the utter disrespect for the historical record in favor of a politically correct story.
