You won’t find a more   and permanent fixture in sports than beer and betting. However, as with all wagers the time to pay up eventually comes, and that time has come for SweetWater Brewery in Atlanta. [Prior to the Super Bowl, SweetWater agreed to a bet with Samuel Adams in Boston. The wager mandated that the brewery from the losing city would have to name a beer after the team from the winning city.  . @SamuelAdamsBeer Let’s #riseup the stakes and force the loser to rename a beer after the winners team.

Thus, leading to the creation of Patriot Pale Ale: it’s the bet that keeps coming back to bite us in the ass @SamuelAdamsBeer. We have 100 of these god awful cans at tours for souvenir beer pic. twitter.   —   SweetWater Brewery (@sweetwaterbrew) February 15, 2017,  The words written on the can give much insight into the tortured existence of those who brought Patriot Pale Ale into the world. The outside of the can reads, “Soul crushing pale ale that will leave you feeling deflated. No G. O. A.

Well done, SweetWater. Well done, indeed. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
