Damien Chazelle’s La La Land earned a   14 nominations, Amazon became the first streaming service to nab a Best Picture contender with Manchester by the Sea and seven of the 20 acting nominations went to people of color when the 89th annual Academy Awards unveiled its nominees Tuesday morning. [La La Land  —   which tied the   nomination record with both All About Eve (1950) and Titanic (1997)  —   will vie for the night’s top prize with eight other films: Arrival, Fences, Hacksaw Ridge, Hidden Figures, Moonlight, Lion, Hell or High Water and the aforementioned Manchester by the Sea.  After two consecutive years in which all of the nominees in each of the four main acting categories were white, sparking #OscarsSoWhite boycotts and protests, seven people of color landed nominations this year: Denzel Washington for Fences Ruth Negga for Loving Mahershala Ali for Moonlight Dev Patel for Lion Viola Davis for Fences Naomie Harris for Moonlight and Octavia Spencer for Hidden Figures. The nominations for Davis, Harris and Spencer mark the first time in Oscar history that three black actors were nominated in the same category in the same year (Best Supporting Actress). Meanwhile, the Documentary category features three films about black life in America: Ava DuVernay’s 13th, Raoul Peck and Hebert Peck’s I Am Not Your Negro and Ezra Edelman and Caroline Waterlow’s OJ: Made in America. Fire at Sea, Gianfranco Rosi’s film about the migrant crisis on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, and Life Animated will also compete in the category. Mel Gibson earned a Best Director nod  —   21 years after he won the award for Braveheart  —   for his work on Hacksaw Ridge, but faces stiff competition from Chazelle (La La Land) Barry Jenkins (Moonlight) Kenneth Lonergan (Manchester by the Sea) and Denis Villeneuve (Arrival). Notably absent from the directing category this year were previous Oscar winners Clint Eastwood (Sully) and Martin Scorsese, who was again overlooked for his   epic Silence. In the Best Actor race, Ryan Gosling will square off against Casey Affleck, Denzel Washington, Viggo Mortensen and Andrew Garfield. Best Actress honors went to Emma Stone, Ruth Negga, Natalie Portman, Isabelle Huppert and, for her 20th nomination, Meryl Streep. Other notable snubs this year included no Amy Adams (Arrival) or Taraji P. Henson (Hidden Figures) in the Actress categories Micheal Keaton (The Founder) and Matthew McConaughey (Gold) in the Actor category and no Deadpool for Best Picture consideration, even though the Academy only nominated nine films in the category this year. Overall, La La Land led with 14 nominations, Arrival and Moonlight picked up eight, Hacksaw Ridge, Lion and Manchester by the Sea earned six apiece and Fences and Hidden Figures earned four. The 89th Academy Awards will air Sunday, February 26 on ABC, with Jimmy Kimmel hosting.
