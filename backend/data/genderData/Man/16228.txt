Amazon are on track to open as many as one hundred physical   stores around the country within the next year. [Thirty Amazon   shops are estimated to be up and running by the end of 2016, before dozens of new shops will start to spring up rapidly in 2017.  Amazon currently have 22   shops around the United States, with locations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, and job listings have surfaced for future stores in Connecticut and Florida. “Experience the full range of Amazon devices (Echo, Fire TV, Fire Tablets, Dash Button, and Kindle) at your local Amazon   store. Experts are   to help you find what’s right for you and your family,” advertises Amazon on their new   shop subsite. “Also learn more about Amazon Prime, Kindle Unlimited, and Amazon FreeTime Unlimited as well as learn more about Amazon Original Series like Transparent and Mozart In the Jungle. ” Last year, Amazon opened its first brick and mortar bookstore in Seattle, featuring matched prices, customer reviews on book displays, and a shop layout and inventory based on the popularity of titles on the store’s online counterpart. The   stores are reported to work in a kiosk fashion, usually in the middle of shopping malls, and are listed to be around just 300 to 500 square feet. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
