Monday in Spokane, WA, while campaigning for his wife, Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton characterized President Barack Obama’s time in office as the “awful legacy of the last eight years. ”  Clinton said, “If you believe we can all rise together, if you believe we’ve finally come to the point where we can put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us, and the seven years before that where we were practicing   economics and no regulation in Washington, which is what cause the crash, then you should vote for her. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
