Despite supplying the weapons of choice for golf legend Tiger Woods and current number four ranked player in the world, Rory McIlroy, Nike Golf calls it quits on their   equipment business. [Wednesday the sports manufacturing and marketing giant announced the stunning news by saying that they plan on accelerating the apparel and golf footwear segment of the company and transition out of the making equipment, which includes clubs, balls, and bags.  Perhaps the greatest single moment in popularizing Nike equipment happened during the 2005 Masters Tournament. On his way to his fourth green jacket, Tiger chipped in for an impossible birdie on the 16th hole after watching his ball journey to the bottom of the cup. The shot revealed the iconic Nike swoosh, appearing to stand still for one breathtaking moment, before disappearing into the hole: Nike’s official announcement reads: Nike, Inc. announced today that it will accelerate innovation in its Golf footwear and apparel business and will partner with more of the world’s best golfers. With this new focus, Nike Golf will transition out of equipment  —   including clubs, balls and bags. We’re committed to being the undisputed leader in golf footwear and apparel,” says Trevor Edwards, President, Nike Brand. “We will achieve this by investing in performance innovation for athletes and delivering sustainable profitable growth for Nike Golf. According to CBS Sports, the Beaverton,   NYSE company founded in 1964 provided no details as to how long the transition will be before they completely halt equipment manufacturing.
