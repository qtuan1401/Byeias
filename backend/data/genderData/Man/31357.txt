Former Indianapolis Colts running back Zurlon Tipton died on Tuesday after car accidentally shooting himself when a gun in his duffel bag reportedly went off at a Michigan car dealership.  According to WJBK, Tipton was struck in the stomach, but “police expected him to be okay, as he was speaking with people at the time he was transported to the hospital. ” He later passed away in the hospital after reportedly arriving in “good condition. ” The Colts signed Tipton as an undrafted free agent in 2014 before releasing him in December of 2015. He played college football at the University of Central Michgian. Our thoughts are with the Tipton family during this difficult time. #RIPZurlon pic. twitter.   —   Indianapolis Colts (@Colts) June 28, 2016,  On and off the field, in practice or in games, this was Tip. #RIP37 pic. twitter.   —   Matt (@MattOverton_LS) June 28, 2016,  I’m hurts me to hear the news of our brother taken from us far too early. #RIPTip,  —   D’Qwell Jackson (@DQ52) June 28, 2016,
