It is impossible for Muslims to integrate into Western Europe, the Czech President Milos Zeman told local television Sunday. Mr. Zeman also blamed the New Years Eve sex attacks in Cologne, Germany, on “Muslim culture”. [Mr. Zelman has previously been outspoken on the migrant invasion flooding Europe and accused refugees “with iPhones” of exploiting their children to get asylum in the European Union (EU).  As Breitbart London reported, last December the    issued Europe with a    to tackle the forces of Islamic state. “I am profoundly convinced that we are facing an organised invasion and not a spontaneous movement of refugees,” Mr. Zeman said in his Christmas message to the Czech Republic. He went on to say that compassion was “possible” for refugees who are old or sick and for children, but not for young men who in his view should be back home fighting against jihadists. “A large majority of the illegal migrants are young men in good health, and single. I wonder why these men are not taking up arms to go fight for the freedom of their countries against the Islamic State,” said the president, who was elected in early 2013. Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia, former communist countries that joined the European Union in 2004, have rejected the EU’s system of quotas for distributing refugees amid the current migrant flood. Now Mr. Zeman has waded into the immigration debate again by questioning the suitability of Muslims to fit into the free, democratic west.
