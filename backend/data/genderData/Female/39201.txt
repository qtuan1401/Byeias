Washington (CNN) Vice President Joe Biden said Monday he might not be going anywhere just yet, leaving the door open to a presidential run in 2020.  After he wrapped at a Senate session Monday, Biden told reporters about how much he enjoyed working in the chamber over his long career there. CNN asked him jokingly if he planned to run for office again. ”Yeah, I am. I’m going to run in 2020,” Biden responded. When asked by reporters for what position, Biden responded, ”For president. What the hell, man.” On Tuesday, as Biden was heading to the House Democratic Caucus meeting in the Capitol, he answered a question about running with a quip as he walked by.  ”I’m going to announce now,” Biden joked. When he was told by the media on Monday they were planning to publish his quotes, the vice president responded, ”That’s okay.”  Senate holds emotional vote to rename cancer bill after Joe Biden’s late son, Beau, ”No, I’ve enjoyed every minutes of my time here in the Senate. It’s a great feeling to come back. I love this place.” Biden later clarified, ”I’m not committing not to run. I’m not committing to anything. I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening.” Biden represented Delaware for 36 years in the Senate before he became President Barack Obama’s vice president in 2008. Biden ran president in 1988 and in 2008, but decided against another presidential bid this election cycle in a October 2015 news conference and eventually endorsed Hillary Clinton.
