An innocent Easter egg hunt in London turned into a police chase as children formed an arrow to show a police helicopter where to find burglary suspects.[  Two suspects broke into a nearby building and ran through the field where the kids hunted eggs. The kids heard the helicopter above them and formed the arrow to show the police where the men ran. “The children quickly formed an arrow on the ground in the middle of a plowed field to guide the helicopter in the direction of the fleeing pair,” said the police. “The helicopter crew relayed this information to officers on the ground and a short time later two men were arrested. ” The police arrested the two men “on suspicion of burglary. ” “I’m sure the last thing the group of daring Capel residents expected when they set out on Friday afternoon was to abandon their Easter egg hunt to assist us in a police search but the initiative they demonstrated proved to be invaluable,” said Sgt. Paul Sochon with the National Police Air.
