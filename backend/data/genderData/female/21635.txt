Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” national correspondent for MSNBC Joy Reid commented on the overnight shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, FL in which approximately 20 people were killed and over 40 were injured and the authorities are investigating as an act of terrorism. She argued the core issue was about “how easy it is to get a gun. ”  Reid said, “We have mass casualty shooting that are affecting children, teachers, people in church, so whether it’s a hate crime or whether it’s related to something related to international terrorism, we’re not getting to the core issue, which is how easy it is to get a gun. I mean Florida happens to have the largest gun owning population in the country and some of the most lax laws as to how you can get your hands on an assault rifle, so if you mean to do harm. We’re talking about a state with 1. 4 million law abiding gun owners. But we’re not talking about that issue. Right now the only debate that’s taking place in the state of Florida, is the Supreme Court weighing whether to allow complete open carry. ”
