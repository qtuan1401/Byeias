Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos will address students at the University of Oregon today from 7PM PST onwards. [Milo will be discussing cultural libertarianism, PC culture, feminism, free speech and problems facing college campuses today, with a QA to follow. The event, hosted by the Oregon chapter of Young Americans for Liberty, can be watched below.   Milo is currently on his “Dangerous Faggot” tour of American campuses, sparking controversy and mayhem wherever he goes. His first stop, at Rutgers University, was marked by chaotic scenes involving Black Lives Matter and feminist protesters, who smeared fake blood on their faces and attempted to drown out Yiannopoulos with protest chants. Last month at a joint event with Steven Crowder and Christina Hoff Sommers at University of Massachusets, a student went off into a rage at the speakers due to her rather large size, the internet affectionately dubbed her “Trigglypuff” with the video of her outburst spreading far and wide. Meanwhile, this Friday, ahead of Milo’s talk at UC Irvine on June 2nd, the university advised students to attend “Safe Zone training. ”  Will anything happen tonight? There’s only one way to find out, and that’s to watch the stream above! Jack Hadfield is a student at Warwick University and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.
