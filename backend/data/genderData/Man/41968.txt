NASAâ€™s Dawn spacecraft orbited the protoplanet Vesta in   and then went into orbit around Ceres in March 2015, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a dwarf planet. Ceres and Vesta are in the main asteroid belt, a vast region between Mars and Jupiter. The area also has many other small bodies, and scientists think they are like time capsules that might hold clues about how our solar system evolved. Dawn was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on September 27, 2007.
