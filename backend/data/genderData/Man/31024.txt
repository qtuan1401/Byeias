Monday on ABC’s “The View,” actress Susan Sarandon argued the concern over terrorists entering the United States through the immigration system was unfounded and declared the country to be “better than this” for harboring such reasons.  Sarandon said, “OK, my grandfather was 15 when he left Sicily because of the war and was a refugee. He came here, made a life, made kids, the whole thing. He struggled. He contributed. And then I start hearing this     xenophobic dialogue that’s going on in this country, you know, where we’ve taken these people and we’ve reduced them to a concept for political reasons. I just thought, ‘My God. We’re better than this.’ This is not who we are. This is America, you know. This is the land of immigrants and refugees. So I thought, these people just don’t have a way to tell their story. They don’t have a voice. Nobody knows who they are. Nobody knows why they’re there. What if I went over by myself, not affiliated with anybody so I could just go wherever it was happening. ” She added, “There needs to be a conversation that’s on a moral level, not a political level. And there haven’t been terrorists that have come through as immigrants. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
