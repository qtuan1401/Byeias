Friday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington D. C. Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) joked that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is “mentally impaired. ”  Gohmert said, “I do want to warn, since most people here are Christians —  and I’m serious about this —  a true believer knows what Jesus did, and still does. You don’t make fun of people who are impaired, have special needs. And whether you like her or not, Hillary Clinton has made clear she is mentally impaired. And this is not somebody you should be making fun of.  So I get the impression that in law school and along the way, she’s been very, very smart. Maybe it was the concussion, the fall back when she did, or maybe —  who knows. They won’t tell us what really is going on with her. If I were going to smash cell phones, BlackBerries, I’d use a   sledge. Well who knows, maybe somebody got to wailing around and hit her again. I don’t know. But we need to be praying for Hillary Clinton. there is special needs there, there is mental impairment. I mean, seriously, she can’t remember. ”
