Washington (CNN) Fox News is making it easier for Republican presidential candidates who don’t make the cut for the network’s August 6   debate to get at least some attention in an earlier event. A network spokeswoman confirmed to CNN Tuesday that it is dropping the mandate that candidates earn at least 1% support in an average of the five most recent national polls in order to qualify for its 5 p. m. debate    an appetizer before the main event, an evening debate for the top 10 highest polling candidates.   Fox News executive vice president Michael Clemente first told Politico of the change, saying in a statement that it’s due to ”overwhelming interest” in the event. The change is helpful for a handful of candidates, including businesswoman Carly Fiorina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former New York Gov. George Pataki, who are all hovering around 1% in recent polls.
