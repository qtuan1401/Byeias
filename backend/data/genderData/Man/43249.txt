’  ’ ’   Bernie Madoff is still in business even though he is behind bars. ’ ’   The convicted fraudster behind the biggest Ponzi scheme in US   history hogged the market for hot chocolate in prison, according   to a  with Steve Fishman, a reporter who has   had considerable contact with Madoff. ’ ”   Madoff, 78, was sentenced in 2009 to 150 years in prison for an   extensive scheme that involved doctoring his clients’ account   statements and returns. He is incarcerated in Butner, North   Carolina. ” ”   In an interview, Fishman told MarketWatch’s Ryan Vlastelica: ” ’’ ’   Fishman is the host of a new    called ”Ponzi Supernova,” which investigates Madoff’’s $65 billion   fraud. It includes previously unpublished interviews with Madoff   and   agents who were involved in the case. ’ ’   ”I sort of rationalized that what I was doing was OK,”  a professor at Harvard Business   School, in an audio interview provided to Business Insider in   December. ’ ’   ”It wasn’’t going to hurt anybody,” Madoff said. ”It was a   temporary thing, and because of the success I that I’’ve had and   the money I’’ve made for people, I sort of felt that it would just   sort of be a temporary situation and acceptable.” ’
