On Tuesday morning, a man wearing a   with the words “F**k the Police” on the front and “Black Lives Matter” on the back was arrested for allegedly opening fire on a police officer’s home. [According to 6 ABC, between “1:30 a. m. and 2:28 a. m” on the east side of Indianapolis, witnesses saw “a black man driving a tan,   Chevy Cobalt [who] had parked the car a few houses east of the [officer’s] house. ” They indicated that “the suspect [got] out of the car, yell[ed] ‘F —   the police,’ and [shot] at the house and police car. ”  The house was not hit, but three bullet holes were found in the police cruiser. A total of “17 shell casings” were discovered at the scene. Police later arrested March Ratney for the shooting. He is on parole, having been arrested in 2008 by the very officer whose home was attacked Tuesday morning. Ratney denies carrying out the attack on the officer’s home. Rather, he says, “He was in the neighborhood because he and his mother live in the area. ” 6 ABC reports that Ratney “urinated in the interview room” while being questioned about the shooting. The officer’s wife and    son were in the house when the attack occurred. No one was injured.
