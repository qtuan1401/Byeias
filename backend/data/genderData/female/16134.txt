Scenes from the city of Milwaukee on August 14, 2016  —   where the death of Sylville Smith in a   shooting has sparked riots.  On Sunday night, reporters on the ground described heated protests, with guns fired and one man wounded. Photographers from news wire services captured clashes between protesters and police  —   but did not post photos of protesters hurling bricks. They also did not document any looting or arson committed throughout the night.
