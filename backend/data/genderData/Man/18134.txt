Following Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos’   with Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones on Twitter yesterday, Jones’ fans created the hashtag #SuspendNeroParty. [Jones blocked and reported Milo following a tweet he made about her reaction to hate mail she was receiving.   If at first you don’t succeed (because your work is terrible) play the victim.  EVERYONE GETS HATE MAIL FFS https:  .   —   Milo Yiannopoulos ひ✘ (@Nero) July 18, 2016,  Following the tweet, many of Jones’ fans turned their hatred towards Milo, somehow believing him to be the primary antagonist of Jones Twitter drama, despite the fact that he had only objected to Jones’ reaction, not sent any “hate mail” himself.  Because of its similarity to the earlier #KimExposedTaylorParty, many clueless Twitter users simply hopped on the drama bandwagon and began tweeting photos of celebrities to the newly created #SuspendNeroParty hashtag. As can be seen in the tweets below, some of the people tweeting didn’t even know who Milo is. I’m here but who’s Nero #SuspendNeroParty pic. twitter.   —   Nicola Foti (@soundlyawake) July 19, 2016,  umm who’s Nero? ?#SuspendNeroParty pic. twitter.   —   andromeda (@wokewitch) July 19, 2016,  Others were just eager to keep the drama train rolling after spending all day tweeting their hatred for Taylor Swift. me rushing to the #SuspendNeroParty right after leaving the #KimExposedTaylorParty pic. twitter.   —   tyler (@houvenerdam) July 19, 2016,  Sorry staying in for this one still hungover from the #KimExposedTaylorParty   #SuspendNeroParty pic. twitter.   —   Thomas (@ThomasBeautyy) July 19, 2016,  Others, however, seemed to be quite aware of who Milo is and as usual started spouting the leftist buzzwords they’ve come to know and all  —   accusing Milo of being racist, sexist and hilariously, homophobic. If you spew racism, homophobia, or any other hate, you have no place anymore on social media, or in any part of society. #SuspendNeroParty,  —   Cole Ledford (@ColeLedford11) July 19, 2016,  Nero and his followers shouldn’t be able to torment countless people with anti blackness, transphobia and islamophobia. #SuspendNeroParty,  —   Ty (@STRAYEDAWAY) July 19, 2016,  Milo however was not entirely silent during the course of this trending hashtag, tweeting out screenshots of Leslie Jones tweets that since have been reported to be fake. Wow, Leslie! pic. twitter.   —   Milo Yiannopoulos ひ✘ (@Nero) July 19, 2016,  Don’t tell me some mischievous internet rascal made them up! https:  .   —   Milo Yiannopoulos ひ✘ (@Nero) July 19, 2016,  Of course some of Milo’s fans quickly realised that a trending hashtag would have literally the opposite of the desired effect of #SuspendNeroParty. So I hear #SUSPENDNEROPARTY is trending. Based on past attempts, @Nero will reach 400k followers tomorrow.  —   Robert Petrosyan (@RobertP1287) July 19, 2016,  #SuspendNeroParty is trending? You’ll only make him stronger. 😂 good luck SJWs @Nero,  —   Andrew Garrett (@alabamadrew) July 19, 2016,  #SuspendNeroParty SJW need to realise that @Nero is pic. twitter.   —   Space Caramel (@4_tune_kookie) July 19, 2016,  With Milo’s Twitter followers continuing to rise, it seems that Milo’s detractors have once again only made him stronger. The unfounded accusations of racism and, hilariously, homophobia have no effect whatsoever anymore  —   it’s become a case of “the SJW who cried racist”.  Milo  —   and the rest of us  —    really deserve a better class of enemy. Milo tweeted his final comment on the doomed suspension campaign with a final message for Jones and her fans. It’s not racist to point out that a movie fucking sucks. The end! See you tomorrow at Clinton Cash launch and GAYS FOR TRUMP PARTY,  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ひ✘ (@Nero) July 19, 2016,  Try harder next time guys!
