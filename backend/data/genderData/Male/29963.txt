On July 15, an alleged home burglar armed with a machete surrendered after being confronted by a homeowner with a handgun. [The incident occurred in Meade County, Kentucky.  According to WLKY, Ron Sheffield and his wife were out, and upon returning home, he noticed “the side door [was] open and the storm door closed. ” Sheffield knew he had not left the door opened, so he drew his handgun before entering the house. Once inside, he encountered    Mark Jones, who was allegedly armed with a machete. Police report that Jones “broke into [the Sheffield] home” while the husband and wife were out. He got down on the floor with a little coaxing from Sheffield, who then held Jones at gunpoint until police arrived. Sheffield said Jones “hesitated” when first ordered to the floor. So Sheffield clarified the terms, saying, “Go down, or you’re dead,” after which Jones complied. Jones was able to find “four antique pistols, a crossbow and a knife” before Sheffield got home, and he used one of them to shoot the Sheffield’s dog. The dog is expected to survive. Police charged Jones “with burglary, theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, and animal cruelty. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
