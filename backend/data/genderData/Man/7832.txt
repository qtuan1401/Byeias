John Dickson, the executive VP and COO of Coastal Community Bank, said the suspects did not escape with any money and that the bank experienced another   by masked thieves trying to access the cash deposit box a few weeks ago. “They attempted to get into the ATM and it looks like they used a blowtorch, which caught the currency on fire and created a little fire damage,” said Dickson. Police identified two suspects from surveillance footage of the incident that shows one of the men trying to urinate on the fire to put it out. The suspects in question are Eli Steen and Jason Kovar, both 31, of Everett, police say. Police say they could arrest Steen and Kovar on charges of burglary and arson because they have “probable cause” and are also looking to question them to see if they are connected to other commercial burglaries that took place in Snohomish County. The Seattle Times reports that the damage to the ATM, cash, and the building is estimated to be $35, 000.
