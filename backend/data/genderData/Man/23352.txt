WARNING: Graphic Video]  Per a report by WPTV, a Florida family’s Christmas cruise ship turned into a scene from a horror film after they found what appeared to be blood pouring out of the top of an elevator on board. The family said they enjoyed the first two nights of the trip aboard Carnival Ecstasy, but the third night is when Matt Davis and his wife Susan discovered what looked to be blood pouring out of the top of the elevator as the doors were struggling to open and close as they were heading to dinner on the 10th floor. “To look and see the elevator with just blood coming down like a sheet, and not stopping  …     it was a real life scene of ‘The Shining,’” Matt Davis said. The couple, who took pictures of the scene, said a man was inside the elevator, and had to run through the blood that was flowing down to get out. Matt Davis said a waiter told him an electrician,    Jose Sandoval Opazo, got hurt, and later a Carnival Ecstasy supervisor told him the electrician died. In the video, you can hear a woman saying, “The man was working on the elevator up there. ” “A crew member or somebody was inside or behind that wall when the elevator came down, and I don’t know what happened, but something terrifying happened,” Matt Davis said. WPTV reported Jose Sandoval Opazo passed away Sunday night, but the cause is still under investigation. The family said Carnival Ecstasy offered to pay for the family to attend three counseling sessions. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
