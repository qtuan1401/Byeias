Top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin said in 2015, after the campaign began, that Clinton is “still not perfect in her head. ”[Clinton staffers were preparing the candidate for a television appearance in April 2015, and strategizing about how to attack   frontrunner Jeb Bush, according to Wikileaks’ dump of campaign chairman John Podesta’s email inbox.  “Yes. If she feels need to address Jeb q directly  —   would suggest the pivot of ‘I will leave commentating on campaign tactics to others, but I am very concerned about the dark money in politics and have to get rid of it once and for all,’” top communications adviser Jen Palmieri told colleagues. “Stronger than ‘I am very concerned  …    . ,’” said speechwriter Joel Benenson. “She’s going to stick to notes a little closer this am, still not perfect in her head,” Abedin told the campaign officials. Breitbart News reported in January 2016: Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s disappearance from the debate stage last month left people speculating that the former First Lady took a long bathroom break, but now a   source with inside connections is alleging that Clinton was missing from the stage due to health issues stemming from a previous brain injury. These   symptoms stemming from a concussion and blood clot, according to a neurologist, suggest Clinton is suffering from   syndrome, which can severely impact her cognitive abilities.
