The Huffington Post has not covered the release of hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) documents which show Hillary Clinton’s party fretting about scandals unearthed by the book Clinton Cash. [A screen capture of the Post reveals that its home page editors make no mention of the leaked dossier on Clinton, which is filled with talking points on various Clinton Cash controversies.  Searches of the site’s content in the past 24 hours show its staff has not written any articles on the subject, either. The only content on the DNC hack today is a “Newsy” video focusing on the hacker. The content is on AOL. com, which owns HuffPo. Huffington Post does technically have a URL containing this one post but, upon opening the page, it immediately redirects to AOL. The release of the DNC’s Clinton documents has been covered at   news outlets such as Mother Jones, The Daily Beast, and Bloomberg, as well as broader news sites like CNET, The Smoking Gun, and IBTimes. Screen shot: The Huffington Post as of press time  —   cut off at last mention of Clinton.
