During a Friday   routine at The Palace Theatre in Albany, New York, comedian Lewis Black reflected on news of record gun sales in America and joked about opening a gun store to sell guns to Christians for Jesus. [Black said his store would be called “Jewy Jew’s Gun Store. ” He said he would open it in Alabama and hoped business would be good enough that he could open an entire chain.  According to the Times Union, Black tied the   Black Friday 2015 gun sales to Christmas and said: “If the Christian community is out there buying weaponry for their loved ones to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, as Jew I recognize that as an opportunity to make money. ” Black also talked about Hillary Clinton’s run for the Democratic nomination by pointing out that he is tired of her involvement in politics. “She never went away. Everyone else who lost [a past presidential bid] went away, even if they came back later,” Black said. “She never went away, ever. She’s been in our face   for 25 years, and I’m tired of her. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
