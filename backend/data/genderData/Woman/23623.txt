The city of Tucson is planning a “Clown Lives Matter” march in response to the real and imagined threats of clowns attacking people, which news outlets and social media are reporting. [The march will be at 6:30 p. m. October 15 on 4th Avenue in Tucson, KNXV reported.  Organizers of the event are encouraging attendees to dress up in full clown makeup or wear masks. “This is a peaceful way to show clowns are not psycho killers,” a flyer advertising the event said. “We want the public to feel safe, and not be afraid. So come out, bring the family, meet a clown and get a hug!” There have been numerous reports of clown sightings across the country during the past few months. In September, two Alabama schools were put on lockdown due to the threat of clowns showing up to lure children into the woods. The reports turned out to be false. Several towns in Georgia reported clown sightings by schools, while one apartment complex in South Carolina reported clown sightings in the woods near the complex.
