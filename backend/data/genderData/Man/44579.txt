’  ’ ’   New San Francisco 49ers linebacker Reuben Foster had an   interesting beginning to his NFL career, as he explained during   his introductory press conference on Friday. ’ ’   Foster experienced something of a tumble in the first round and   had still not been picked by the final two picks Thursday night. ’ ’   According to Foster, by the time the 31st pick rolled around, the   New Orleans Saints had called him, essentially welcoming him   to the team because they were going to take him with the 32nd   overall pick, the last of the first round. ’ ’   Foster explained that while the Saints were talking to his   girlfriend on the phone, he got another call. He took the phone   back and clicked over and it was the 49ers.
