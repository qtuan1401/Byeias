’  ’ ’   A bus carrying dozens of elementary school students crashed in    Tennessee, on Monday, killing an   undetermined number of people and sending 23 to a local hospital   with injuries, police said. ’ ”   The students were in kindergarten through fifth grade, a   spokesman for the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said. That   would make them roughly ages 5 to 10. ” ’   The bus carried 35 students, the  Times   Free Press reported, citing  Fire   Department Assistant Chief Tracy Arnold. ’ ’   ”Multiple fatalities are involved in this bus crash. However,   contrary to media reports, no firm numbers have been confirmed   yet,” the fire department wrote on Twitter. ’ ’   Photographs issued by the  Fire   Department showed the bus on its side, wrapped around a tree. ’ ’’ ’   The bus driver is being questioned and cooperating with   investigators, the Police said on   Twitter. ’ ’     people were transported in ambulances to a local   hospital, and the last patient was extricated from the bus, the   fire department said. ’ ’   Police Chief Fred Fletcher called the accident ”every public   safety professional’’s worst nightmare,” the Times Free Press   reported. ’ ’   Two bloodied students laid on stretchers in a front yard nearly   an hour after the crash receiving attention from first   responders, while others not taken to the hospital appeared dazed   with cuts on their faces, the newspaper said on its website. ’ ’   (Editing by Howard Goller and Lisa Shumaker) ’
