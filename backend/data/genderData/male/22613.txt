Former President Bill Clinton declares he was a heroic figure at the Clinton Foundation, taking money from wealthy people and redistributing to the poor. [Clinton defended his work at the Clinton Foundation during a speech in Ohio, calling the notion that it was corrupt was “really funny. ”  “Here is what I did, I was sort of Robin Hood, except I didn’t rob anybody,” Clinton said. “I just asked people with money to give it to people who didn’t have money and we tried to use it in America and around the world to save jobs, to create jobs and to save lives. ” Hillary Clinton also defended the Clinton Foundation in an interview with ABC News anchor David Muir, asserting that her husband should not resign as head of the foundation until after the election. “I don’t think there are conflicts of interest,” she said. “I know that that’s what has been alleged and never proven. But nevertheless, I take it seriously. ”
