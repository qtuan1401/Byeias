During the January 14 GOP Debate, presidential hopeful Ted Cruz responded to moderator Neil Cavuto’s question on Obama and gun confiscation by pointing out that Obama demonstrated he was angling to take away guns from the moment he entered the White House. [Cruz suggested that Obama did this by “appointing Eric Holder as Attorney General and Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. ”  Cruz continued: [Obama als0] appointed Sonya Sotomayor to the Supreme Court —  someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. He launched Fast  Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shot law enforcement officials. Cruz added: And I’ll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said. Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case. There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever. Which means, if their view prevailed —  and the next president’s going  to get to appoint one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices —  the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns. Cruz then turned to the   Hook gun control push led by Obama and Senator Chuck Schumer ( ) among  others, and reminded television viewers and debate audience members that he “led the opposition —  along with millions of Americans —  and we defeated that gun control legislation. ” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
