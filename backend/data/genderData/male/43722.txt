’  ’ ”   For the second time in six months, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire   Hathaway  billions of dollars into the US   airline industry. ” ”   In total, Buffett’s investment in        and    Airlines totals nearly $10 billion. ” ’   The move showed a stunning change of heart for Buffett, who as   recently as 2013 referred to the US airline industry as a   ”deathtrap for investors.” ’ ”   However, it is the consistency of Buffett’s investment in   America’s big four airlines  —  $2. 1 billion in American, $2. 2   billion in United, $2. 4 billion in Southwest, and $3 billion in   Delta  —   that’s most enlightening.  ” ”   It’s indicative of the overall strength of the US airline   industry and  —   from the perspective of consumer  —   the lack   of product offerings. ” ’   Over the past decade, the landscape of the airline industry in   the US has changed greatly. All four airlines have reported   record profits, over the fast two years, buoyed     crisis capacity discipline, depressed labor costs, and cheap   oil.  ’ ’   There are also fewer competitors in the domestic market   to contend with. ’ ’   In the year 2000, the sky was filled with names such as America   West, US Airways, TWA, AirTran, Continental, ATA, and Northwest   Airlines. By 2016, all of these brands had disappeared by being   merged into or acquired by the Big Four.  ’ ’   As a result, apart from boutique airlines (Virgin American,   JetBlue) regional brands (Alaska, Hawaiian) and   cost   carriers (Spirit, Frontier) on the fringe, the Big Four only have   to contend with themselves.  ’ ’  ’ ”   This is especially the case for American, Delta, and United  —   the   nation’s three remaining   legacy   carriers.    ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   With that said, Southwest tends to march by the beat of its own   drum a bit more. Unlike the other three, Southwest operates a   single type of aircraft  —   the Boeing 737  —   using a     business model. Furthermore, Southwest differentiates itself by   forgoing   routes, checked baggage fees, and business   class cabins.  ’ ’   Although the four US   are the most profitable   airlines in the world right now  —   apart from Southwest which has   experienced more than four decades of continued profitability  —     the airlines are not that many years removed from financial   ruin. ’ ”   Fortunately, the recent wave of airline consolidation have made   the surviving carriers stronger. The 2008   merger   was an absolute home run. The resulting airline not only   generates the best financial performance in the   business, it’s also an industry leader in operational   excellence. It’s considered to be the strongest of the big   four.  ” ”   United’s 2010 merger has proved to be a rocky affair —   with the   merged airline suffering through periods of financial, labor, and   management instability. Fortunately, the airline’s new leadership   under the command of CEO Oscar Munoz has made significant strides   over the past year to solve the airline’s labor and performance   issues.  ” ’  ’ ”   Southwest’s 2010 acquisition of AirTran Airways has proved to be   a successful endeavor with the latter bolstering the     airline’s presence East of the Mississippi.  ” ”   American and US Airway’s recently completed merger made the     company the largest airline in the world. Even   though the new company will have to contend with cultural and   operation differences, American’s powerful and efficient domestic   network makes it a formidable competitor. ” ’   All in all, the four largest airlines in the US, which also   happen to be four largest in the world, are in a good place.   Which is why all four warrant the investment from the Oracle of   Omaha.  ’ ’For the second time in six months, Warren. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
