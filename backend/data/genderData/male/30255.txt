Pranksters using creepy clown images posted a slew of death threats against students throughout Northern California over Instagram on Tuesday, prompting schools to increase their police presence. [According to local Sacramento NBC News affiliate KCRA, an Instagram post from user sa. townclown was being circulated by students in Elk Grove that included a caption that read, “Schools I’m hitting up this Halloween season! we are messing with all you! SHELDON better be carful cuz we coming for ya’ll! we ain’t clowning around! !!!! !”  A hit list on Instagram, fearing “creepy clowns. ” The account appears to have been deleted. “The clown said I’m gonna cut your throat,” one male student from Elk Grove High School told KCRA. “I’m just freaking out because I’m going all over Instagram and all I see is clowns, clowns, clowns,” the male student said. “How does something like this go worldwide?” he posited. As a result of the threats, and worried phone calls from parents, Elk Grove Unified School District reportedly sent over 75, 000 emails to staff and parents informing them that that are aware of the situation and monitoring it. Dr. Will Cushman, the principal at Fairfield High School, told KCRA that law enforcement does not see the creepy clown threats as credible. The school districts and police departments reportedly urged parents and students on campuses to be vigilant and to report any unusual activity to law enforcement. Meanwhile, the hashtag #creepyclown has garnered some videos of clowns appearing out of nowhere to frighten passers by.
