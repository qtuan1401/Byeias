Mexican authorities have released a video to the Mexican TV station Televisa that shows the fierce gun battle that eventually led to the capture of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman Loera. [The video shows the moment Mexican Marines storm the house where El Chapo had been staying and the fierce resistance that the drug lord’s gunmen put up.   The operation was dubbed by the Mexican government as “Black Swan”.  In the early minutes you can see a Mexican Marine be shot and his team mates cover him as they continue trying to move into the various rooms of the house.  In addition to gunfire, the military had to use grenades and explosives to counter the similar armament that El Chapo’s men used.  As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, the fighting resulted in multiple arrests as well as five dead gunmen.  Interestingly the video shows at least one man in tactical gear who appears to be the commanding officer and is not in uniform but wears a red sweat shirt instead. The man out of uniform has sparked various debates on social media as to the man’s role. Those speculating ask if the man is a Mexican federal agent, a U. S. federal agent, or an international contractor. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas you can follow him on Twitter and on Facebook.
