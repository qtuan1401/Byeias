’  ’ ’   ”Colossal,” Anne Hathaway’’s new movie, is the type of   film that could have easily been terrible. ’ ”   It’s a   drama about female   and the   dangers of alcoholism. Hathaway plays a woman who  —   after   struggling with her career, boyfriend, and drinking too much  —     moves back to her hometown in upstate New York, only to learn   that she has a mental link with a kaijū monster   terrorizing Seoul. ” ’   A   story is, basically, a story with   a ”what if” premise that can be pitched in just a few   words. It’’s been a popular genre for decades, usually because it   turns a science fiction or fantasy conceit into a story   that’’s easy to understand and imparts some kind of moral   lesson, like Rod Serling’’s ”Twilight Zone.” ’ ’   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, some of the best, most   thoughtful comedies were   films, including ”Big” (a   teenager who wishing to be an adult suddenly becomes   one) and ”Groundhog Day” (a weatherman lives the same day on   repeat). They became more ambitious, producing some of   the most important movies in Hollywood, like ”Jurassic Park”   (what if dinosaurs were alive today?) and ”Toy Story” (what if   toys could talk? ). ’ ’  ’ ’   By the late 1990s and early 2000s, some of the better     movies became increasingly creative, but the time   period also began to produce some films that dated poorly. 1997   had ” ” (what if an FBI agent swapped faces with a   criminal? ”) and 2004 had ”The Incredibles” (what goes on in a   family of undercover superheros? ). The same period also included    (a man falls in love with a woman with     memory loss) and   like ”Snakes on a   Plane” (snakes are on a plane). ’ ’   By now,   movies are almost entirely awful comedies.   In the past decade, we’’ve had to witness ”The Tooth Fairy”   (Dwayne Johnson pretends to be the tooth fairy) ”Bedtime   Stories” (Adam Sandler tells his kids stories that come true)   and the regrettable ”Jack and Jill” (Adam Sandler plays his   own twin, who is a woman). ’ ’  ’ ’   That’’s where ”Colossal” comes in. ’ ’   ”Colossal” is by no means a perfect movie. The middle third,   especially, is uneven, teetering in tone from absurdist dark   comedy to threatening   thriller. But it is, for the   most part, very good. ’ ’   Anne Hathaway, once again, knocks it out of the park, and Jason   Sudeikis demonstrates himself to be a shockingly effective   dramatic actor. The ending, too, is a   that nicely   wraps the whole story together. ’ ’  ’ ’   And more importantly, ”Colossal” shows what a   movie   can do. Its   premise, where a young   woman has a mental link with a monster on the other side of the   world that allows her to control it  —   it’’s perfect for high   jinks. And it is indeed occasionally funny, in a dark,        kind of way. ’ ”   But at the same time,   Nacho Vigalondo’s   film explores serious issues, like the consequences of alcoholism   and the bad decisions we make. That sounds mundane if   the movie didn’t have a monster that destroys   Seoul in it. ” ’   Hopefully, ”Colossal” signals the beginning of a new stage in the     genre, where it can be restored to its former glory.   It’’s certainly time. ’ ’ ’ ’”Colossal,” Anne Hathaway’’s new movie, is the. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
