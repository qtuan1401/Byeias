Police in Revere, Massachusetts, are asking the public to help identify a man accused of peeping at a teen girl who was undressing in a Target changing room, a report says. [Police have now released still photos from the store’s surveillance video feed after being called about the incident at around 2:00 p. m. on Sunday.  The    victim described the perpetrator as a white man in his thirties, brown hair, wearing a white     shirt. He may have been driving a   Toyota Prius. Anyone with information should “contact Det. Bruker at    or krbuker@reverepolice. org. ” The Bay State legislature recently updated its peeping laws to ban another disturbing practice of these peepers: using cell phones to take images under their skirts or in changing rooms and bathrooms. Lawmakers celebrated closing the loophole that, until the change, allowed people to use cell phones for the nefarious purpose without penalty. “We are sending a message that to take a photo or video of a woman under her clothing is morally reprehensible and, in Massachusetts, we will put you in jail for doing it,” Senate President Therese Murray said as the law was passed.
