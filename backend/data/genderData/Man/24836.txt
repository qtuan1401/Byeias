The Department of Justice and the FBI released a more complete transcript of Muslim terrorist Omar Mateen’s    phone call with his statement pledging allegiance to the Islamic State after he gunned down dozens in a gay Orlando night club last Sunday. [“Unfortunately, the unreleased portions of the transcript that named the terrorist organizations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime,” the joint statement read. “As much of this information had been previously reported, we have   the complete transcript to include these references in order to provide the highest level of transparency possible under the circumstances. ”  The new transcript still replaces the Muslim god “Allah” with God: 2:35 a. m.: Shooter contacted a 911 operator from inside Pulse. The call lasted approximately 50 seconds, the details of which are set out below: (OD) Orlando Police Dispatcher, (OM) Omar Mateen, OD: Emergency 911, this is being recorded. OM: In the name of God the Merciful, the beneficent [Arabic] OD: What? OM: Praise be to God, and prayers as well as peace be upon the prophet of God [Arabic]. I wanna let you know, I’m in Orlando and I did the shootings. OD: What’s your name? OM: My name is I pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr   of the Islamic State. OD: Ok, What’s your name? OM: I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr   may God protect him [Arabic] on behalf of the Islamic State. OD: Alright, where are you at? OM: In Orlando. OD: Where in Orlando? [End of call.] The Obama administration drew intense criticism for initially scrubbing the terrorist’s references to the Islamic State as he perpetuated the deadliest mass shooting in U. S. history. “What we’re not going to do is further proclaim this man’s pledges of allegiance to terrorist groups, and further his propaganda,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch declared Sunday, before the administration reversed its decision.
