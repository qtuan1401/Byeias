Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said that while pointing to Bill’s behavior isn’t the “most effective” way to beat Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, “if my husband were doing that, I would have left him” and apologized to his accusers rather than attacking them like Hillary did on Wednesday’s “Hannity” on the Fox News Channel.  Fiorina stated of the allegations of sexual assault against Bill, [relevant remarks begin around 3:40] “Oh, sure it’s fair game. Look, everything Bill Clinton has done fair game. He’s a former president. I just don’t think that’s the most effective way to beat Hillary Clinton. Because while all that was going on, there were a lot of women who felt, for whatever reason, great sympathy for Hillary Clinton. Look, if my husband were doing that, I would have left him. I wouldn’t have behaved the way Hillary Clinton did, and I would have apologized to all those women. ” Fiorina added that Hillary helped attack Bill’s accusers, but that the best way to beat Hillary is to remind people of her behavior.
