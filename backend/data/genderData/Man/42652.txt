 (CNN) A second person badly burned by the fireball that engulfed a crowd at a water park in Taiwan over the weekend has died from his injuries, local media reported Thursday. Liu   a    design student who suffered burns to 90% of his body, was pronounced dead early Thursday, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported, citing doctors. The explosion during a party Saturday at the Formosa Fun Coast water park outside Taipei, the capital, was set off when colored powder being sprayed over the crowd ignited, officials say. The fiery blast injured close to 500 people, most of them in their teens and 20s. A    woman died from her injuries on Monday. Around 270 people hurt in the explosion remained in intensive care units late Wednesday, the Central News Agency reported. The event at the water park was run by Color Play Asia, which holds   parties. Two men    the party organizer and the person in charge of lighting and hardware    have been named as suspects by authorities and are on bail. Taiwan’s government has banned events from using colored powder while the explosion is being investigated, and the water park has been closed during the investigation.
