LONDON, United Kingdom  —   Thousands of EU supporters marched through the streets of London Saturday afternoon demanding the Brexit vote be ignored by Britain’s political class. [Many participants in the “March for Europe” held banners declaring their love of the European Union and telling the government to ignore the wishes of 52 per cent of the British public.  Addressing the crowd, Irish singer Bob Goldof  —   who became infamous during the referendum campaign after being pictured insulting impoverished fishermen  —   told people to spend the next two years fighting the referendum result. “We must do everything possible within our individual power to stop this country being totally destroyed,” he said.
