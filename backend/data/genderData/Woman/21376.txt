Monday during the State Department’s daily briefing, Fox News reporter James Rosen pressed spokesman Mark Toner on reports that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s long time top aide Huma Abedin once worked at a radical Muslim publication that blamed the   terror attacks on America and opposed women’s rights.  While Toner would not address the specific allegations, he insisted Huma Abedin was “fully vetted” for her postilion as then Clinton’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department. Rosen asked, “During her tenure here, was Ms. Abedin’s association with this journal known to the secretary or anyone else in this building?” Toner responded, “I don’t have an immediate answer for you on that. I haven’t seen these reports, to be honest, what I would say is that we wouldn’t normally talk about someone’s clearance process except to say that having gone through the security clearance process and considering the level of clearance she would have needed for the job that she held, I can assure you that she was, like any individual would be, fully vetted, But I can’t speak to these specific allegations. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
