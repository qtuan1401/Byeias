CHARLESTON, South Carolina —   Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul ( ) won the undercard debate because he didn’t go to it, according to an online poll from US News. [US News asked readers who they thought won the undercard debate, with 95 percent of respondents saying that Rand Paul won the undercard debate for not showing up.  Paul was dropped from the primetime debate   and moved to the undercard debate. Paul chose not to attend the undercard debate and told Breitbart News this week that the Republican National Committee is to blame. He told Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle that the RNC cut him from the debate because ” the establishment wants fewer voices. ” They want an artificial designation saying that all of a sudden, we’re going to change the amount of voices on the stage. But I think it’s a mistake. There are a lot of libertarian or liberty voters out there that could be the deciding vote and if you want to keep them in the Republican Party it would make sense for the party to treat   candidates with more respect. It is a problem, trying to keep liberty and independent voters in the party so we’ll see what happens but I can tell you our supporters aren’t too happy at the process now.
