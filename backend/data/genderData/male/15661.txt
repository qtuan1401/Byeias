JERUSALEM (AFP)  —    A suspected Palestinian stabbed and moderately wounded an Israeli military officer in a West Bank settlement Sunday morning before being shot by forces at the scene, the army said. [“A terrorist carried out a stabbing attack in Efrat and wounded an officer,” the military’s Twitter account said. There was no immediate word on the condition of the perpetrator, who was being evacuated to hospital for treatment.  The Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem said the soldier was stabbed in his armpit. It was the fifth incident of Palestinians attacking Israeli security forces and civilians since Friday after a   lull in a nearly   wave of violence. Since October, 227 Palestinians, 34 Israelis, two Americans, one Jordanian, one Eritrean and a Sudanese have been killed in ongoing violence, according to an AFP count. Israeli forces say most of the Palestinians killed were carrying out knife, gun or   attacks. Others were shot dead during protests and clashes.
