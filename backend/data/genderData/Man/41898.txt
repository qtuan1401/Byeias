Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama met Thursday with the family of an American killed by ISIS, visiting the parents and sister of journalist Steven Sotloff during a trip to Miami.  Sotloff was beheaded by ISIS in September, and the terror group’s decision to release a video of his death increased the attention    and news coverage    that its march through Iraq and Syria has received in the United States.  Slain journalist Steven Sotloff has final word at his memorial service, National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said Obama ”expressed his and the first lady’s condolences for Steven’s death.”  ”He appreciated the chance to hear from the Sotloffs more about Steven’s work as a journalist, including his passion for bringing the stories of people who are suffering to the rest of the world in the hope of making a positive difference, including in Syria,” Meehan said.  She said Obama also recognized the family’s foundation set up in Sotloff’s memory to support journalists who are reporting from conflict zones, called ”2Lives: Steven Joel Sotloff Memorial Foundation.”   Earlier this year, Obama met with the family of Kayla Mueller during a visit to Phoenix. Mueller, a    aid worker, was killed while being held by ISIS in Syria, and her death was made public in February. ’Enormous resources’ on rescue attempt for Kayla Mueller, Obama says
