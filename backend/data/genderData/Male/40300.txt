 (CNN) Having a bad day?  Leave it to Twitter to make it worse. The admission by NBC’s Brian Williams that he fibbed about being on a U. S. military helicopter that took enemy fire during the Iraq War prompted not one but two trending hashtags:  #BrianWilliamsMemories and #BrianWilliamsMisremembers, In case you missed it, Williams, the anchor of the ”NBC Nightly News,” apologized on Wednesday for multiple claims over the years that he’d been aboard a helicopter that was ”forced down after being hit by an RPG.”  The incident happened on March 24, 2003.  A helicopter was forced down by enemy fire. But Williams wasn’t on it.   His chopper arrived about an hour later and landed next to the damaged one. Williams blamed his version of the incident on foggy memory, and said he felt terrible.  Well then, better stay away from Twitter for a while, Mr. Williams. You’ll feel much worse.  The #BrianWilliamsMemories hashtag had a healthy run all day Wednesday. Thursday morning, #BrianWilliamsMisremembers was the rage.  In them, tweeters reimagine Williams reliving other ”accomplishments.” In other words, these memories    just like the Iraq incident     are, you know, made up. The time he reported from the moon. Or carried those tablets of stone. The time he provided prudent advice to an aspiring rock band. Or told God he did a good job. The time he inspired a key moment in the Civil Rights Movement. His role in a key World War II battle . .. . .. and his work as a military strategist from way back when.
