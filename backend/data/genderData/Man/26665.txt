Ted Cruz ( ) said Thursday on Sirius XM’s Breitbart News Daily that his son’s support among evangelicals is “incredible. ”[“I am talking to evangelicals all the time. The support that we have among evangelicals is incredible. We have a tremendous number of pastors in South Carolina that have endorsed Ted Cruz. ”  Breitbart News Daily host, Stephen K. Bannon, asked about the criticism that Cruz has received from some who say that Cruz is just an “evangelical candidate. ” “Ted is a strong constitutional conservative,” Mr. Cruz said. “As a matter of fact, none of the other candidates come even close. ” The senior Cruz also spoke of how his son became passionate about the U. S. Constitution at a young age. “The reason I know my son Ted Cruz will honor the Constitution and not will compromise his principles in Washington is because that fire is as alive today as it was over thirty years ago. ” He also spoke about why he believes America is a unique and great country. “America is the only country on the face of the Earth that was founded on the word of God. That was founded on   principles that have made America the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Those same   principles which are principles of liberty, principles of equality, principles of integrity, principles of individual responsibility. Those fundamental principles are what built America. ” Hear the interview:
