One of the most popular bars in Key West, Florida, erupted in a brawl, police say, because one couple took offense over another patron’s farting. [According to the Miami Herald, Florida police reveal the fight took place last Friday “due to someone farting” at a Sloppy Joe’s restaurant and bar.  The report stated that Naples, Florida, residents Richard McBride, 53, and girlfriend Sandra Stoner, 55, joined in an argument with an unidentified couple “over a fart. ” The Naples couple said that they took offense and began a war of words with the other couple with Stoner confronting them in “an aggressive manner. ” Key West Officer Igor Kasyanenko confirms that surveillance video shows Stoner getting out of her seat to confront the unknown woman by “getting in her face in what appeared to me as an aggressive manner. ” Apparently the unidentified woman began to tussle with Stoner, causing McBride to enter the fight to shove the woman away. After he pushed the woman, the man punched McBride in the face, the report says. McBride admits he then tackled the man, sending both of them tumbling to the ground. Bar security then broke up the fight. The other couple left the establishment before police arrived. Ultimately, McBride, who police say smelled of alcohol, received hospital treatment and no charges were filed. The fight is now gone with the wind.
