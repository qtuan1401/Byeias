’  ’ ’   After finding himself glued to the bench during the NBA Finals,   it was unclear if Matthew Dellavedova had much of a future with   the Cleveland Cavaliers. ’ ”   On Friday, Dellavedova received a   $38 million contract   offer from the Milwaukee Bucks, as first reported by ESPN’s Zach   Lowe. ” ”   Dellavedova, a key member of the Cavs’ Finals run in 2015,   is a restricted free agent, meaning that the Cavs could match the   offer if they choose. ” ”   But it doesn’t appear as if that’s in the cards  —   at least,   according to LeBron James. After the news broke, James tweeted   congratulations to Dellavedova and bid him farewell to Milwaukee. ” ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tCongrats to my brother!  on his deal!  Good luck in Milwaukee! Very deserving to you and your family. 1’t’t’ ”   It is possible that James was unaware of Dellavedova’s   restricted   status. But given James’  in past Cavs   this seems unlikely. ” ”   More than $9 million per year would be a bit expensive for a   backup guard whom the Cavs didn’t have much use for in the   Finals. Whether James helped make this call or was simply   informed by the Cavs’ front office, it seems that Dellavedova is   going to Milwaukee. ”
