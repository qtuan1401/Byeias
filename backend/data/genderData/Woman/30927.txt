Senator Claire McCaskill ( ) who is supporting Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, stated that Democratic candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) arguing that Clinton isn’t qualified “is like fingernails on a blackboard to many women across this country,” and “women who have succeeded in   fields have been used to being marginalized about whether or not they’re truly qualified” on Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports. ”  McCaskill said, “[C]alling Hillary Clinton not qualified is like fingernails on a blackboard to many women across this country, and I think Bernie probably knows that. ” When asked if she thought gender was involved, McCaskill answered, “Well, I just think it’s one of those things that maybe it’s not right. But, I think women who have succeeded in   fields have been used to being marginalized about whether or not they’re truly qualified. And this is an example where we have a candidate for president, who is the most qualified, and happens to be a woman. And I think there are many women that are excited about that, and for anybody to call her unqualified is hard for those women to hear. I don’t think Bernie really believes that Hillary Clinton isn’t qualified to be president. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
