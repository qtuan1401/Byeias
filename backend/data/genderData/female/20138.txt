Sen. Marco Rubio doesn’t plan to be at his own campaign’s rally tonight after the results of the Nevada caucuses come in, according to his schedule. [Rubio held a caucus day rally in Las Vegas this morning, but will leave Nevada for a rally in Minneapolis this afternoon and an event in Grand Rapids, Michigan this evening. Campaign aides say that was planned. Since the results wouldn’t be clear until late in the evening, they decided to spend valuable time campaigning in other states.  Instead, Rubio supporters in Nevada will gather with Lt. Governor Mark Hutchinson and members of the campaign in Las Vegas this evening at Dom Demarco’s Pizzeria, according to his schedule. Previously, Rubio has held a rally for supporters to celebrate the election results in the early primary states  —   even when he placed fifth in the New Hampshire primary. In South Carolina on Saturday, Rubio celebrated his second place finish, calling it a dramatic comeback for his campaign. “If it is God’s will that we should win this election, then history will say that on this night in South Carolina we took the first step forward in the beginning of a New American Century,” he said proudly as he exited the stage. But pundits have increasingly grown skeptical of Rubio’s dramatic election night speeches especially after losing each state. Rubio’s strategy is to campaign in many suburban vote pockets as possible in the hopes of boosting his campaign in the Super Tuesday contests.
