On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” Rep. Elijah Cummings ( ) said that he doesn’t “necessarily” think the Democratic Party should move away from identity politics, but that the party should “concentrate” on economic issues.  Cummings responded to a question on Senator Bernie Sanders’ statement that the Democratic Party should move away from identity politics by stating, “I think we need to  —   no, I don’t necessarily agree. I think we need to deal with economics. I think economics is very important, but I think that we need to still pay attention to so many people who have been left out of the system in one way or another. Just like what I just talked about with voting rights of certain segments of our population. I think we can do both. But we’ve got to concentrate on economics, because a lot of people are suffering, and   and Hispanics are suffering probably more than other parts of our communities. ” (  RCP) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
