On Thursday, MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”   Mika Brzezinski said that it feels like Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is “lying straight out” about her emails.  Brzezinski said, “Here are the things that, like over time, we remember here, her saying repeatedly it was allowed. A private server, set up in her home, by an IT guy who was given immunity, and his emails are missing. And she even joked when she was asked, and I think in a high school gym, did you wipe the server, meaning get rid of everything so no one could see it and she joked about it being with a cloth. And, I mean, I really don’t want to be the one delivering this, but, I’ve got to tell you, this is really hard to believe. It feels like she’s lying straight out. ” MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell added that while she couldn’t say Clinton was lying, “[I]t doesn’t hold up. there are so many inconsistencies, including their response yesterday.   …     But they should have just come out, arguably, and said, this is a mess and we’re going to try to move on. Instead, they’re fighting it, and coming out with a completely noncredible argument on her behalf. ” (  Washington Free Beacon) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
