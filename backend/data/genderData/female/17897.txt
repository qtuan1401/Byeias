An NBC   polled conducted after the Orlando terror attack shows half of voters distrust the government on gun control. [The start date for conducting the poll  —   June 19  —   was one week after the attack that killed 49 people at the Pulse Orlando nightclub.  According to NBC News, 50 percent of voters believe the government “will go too far in restricting gun rights” while 47 percent believe the government “will not do enough. ” And despite the relentless Democrat push to ban “assault weapons” in the wake Orlando, 49 percent of voters said such a ban is “NOT worth it because it will not stop the attackers from getting the weapons they need. ” A smaller group of voters  —   45 percent  —   believe the ban is “worthwhile. ” Think about it: One week after Omar Mateen entered Pulse Orland0 with an   and a handgun and killed 49 people, half of voters expressed distrust regarding the government’s attempt to use the incident to secure more gun control. Moreover, the percentage of voters who believe an “assault weapons” ban is not worthwhile is larger than the percentage who believe otherwise. To understand these poll results one need only come to grips with the fact that Mateen passed a background check for his firearms  —   Democrats constantly stress the importance of a background check  —   and he also passed a   waiting period for his handgun. Moreover, the club in which he carried out his attack was a   zone, which means it had 100 percent gun control via an   gun ban. But background checks did not stop Mateen, nor did a waiting period, nor did the declaration of a   zone. Yet after all these gun control failures the government’s solution is  —   more gun control. Half of voters distrust this approach. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
