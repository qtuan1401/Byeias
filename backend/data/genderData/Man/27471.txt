Bruce Jenner has cancelled a planned   speaking tour, amidst reports of slow ticket sales and lack of interest. [Jenner had planned to kick off the Unique Lives and Experiences “Up Close and Personal” tour on February 22 in Toronto, with stops at theaters in Vancouver, Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle, but a rep for the former Olympian and reality TV star said scheduling conflicts forced the cancellation of all five dates.  “[There was a] conflict of dates with other work commitments,” a Jenner spokesperson told Fox411. Celebrity outlet TMZ reports that low interest and sluggish ticket sales may have played a role in the cancellation. A spokesperson for the Toronto venue told the outlet that “a lot” of tickets remained available for Jenner’s speaking engagement there before it was cancelled. Jenner was at one time a mainstay on the motivational speaker circuit. Before transitioning, Jenner earned an estimated $ $40, 000 per speaking engagement, according to   website BigSpeak. com. Jenner has been busy recently, having joined the Oscar campaign for the independent   film Tangerine. “We have a lot of momentum in the trans community, but we have to keep that momentum going,” Jenner said at a special screening of the film in Los Angeles on Monday. “We have to bring this in front of the public. ” I Am Cait, the E!   that chronicles Jenner’s transition from a man to a woman, was renewed for a second season in September. The show will premiere some time later this year.
