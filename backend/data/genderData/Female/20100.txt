Thursday, former NFL linebacker Ray Lewis said while discussing the recent police shootings that black men are now “fearful” to walk out of their own houses.  “As a black man you’re fearful to walk out of your house now,” Lewis said on Fox Sports 1’s “Undisputed. ” “Let me tell you why. I’ve been doing so much like trying to figure this out because the reason why black lives matter is because we got a heart. We got a pulse. We’re the exact same, but don’t make us and trick me and tell me that we’re the exact same when you know you look at me differently, you see? That’s where the issue is. Don’t tell me I’m something and then look at me and then tell me I’m that same thing that I know I already am. ” Lewis was indicted during his time as a Baltimore Raven on double murder charges in connection to the fatal stabbing of two men after a Super Bowl party in January of 2000, but charges were dismissed in exchange for his testimony against two other men at the party.
