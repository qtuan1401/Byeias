Breitbart Tech Editor Milo Yiannopoulos is set to debate controversial feminist Julie Bindel at the University of Michigan. The event begins at 7pm EST.[  The debate topic is entitled “Does feminism have a free speech problem?” and is to run for two hours. The event is hosted by university news outlet The Michigan Review, and the official live video stream is available above. Yiannopoulos and Bindel were previously arranged to debate at the University of Manchester last year, but were both banned from attending the campus by the college’s student union for reportedly going against the “Safe Space Policy. ” Charlie Nash is a contributor to Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.
