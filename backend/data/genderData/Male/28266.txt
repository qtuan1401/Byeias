  rap sensation Desiigner was arrested Thursday night on gun and drug charges after he allegedly pointed a loaded gun at a driver during a road rage incident in New York City. [The “Panda” rapper was riding in a vehicle with four members of his crew when he allegedly aimed a loaded firearm at passengers in another vehicle. Desiigner’s SUV quickly left the scene of the incident, but not before the driver of the other vehicle reportedly collected the license plate information and called law enforcement, according to the Los Angeles Times.  Desiigner’s SUV was later found, and the rapper has since been charged with felony criminal possession of a weapon, felony possession of a controlled substance and menacing. Rolling Stone reports that police found “OxyContin and various other prescription pills” in the SUV. Four of Desiigner’s associates,  —   Utril Rhaburn, Scott Siegel, C. J. McCoy, and the rapper’s hypeman Michael Davis  —   were charged with felony possession of a controlled substance. In February,    mogul Kanye West signed Desiigner to his GOOD Music record label. The young artist quickly rose to rap stardom after his hit single “Panda” climbed to number one on Billboard’s Hot 100. Desiigner reportedly remains in custody while he awaits his court hearing.
