The first episode of The Milo Yiannopoulos Show was a hit on iTunes, rising to become at least the 21st most popular podcast on the service. [Naturally, this extraordinary opening week performance is almost entirely down to my own appearance on the podcast, and had very little to do with the show’s host, whose name escapes me.  The podcast will provide regular relief for conservatives, cultural libertarians, dissident liberals and anyone else who objects to the daily lunacies of the regressive left. Social justice warriors in tech, on campus, and in the workplace will now face weekly scrutiny from one of the most popular shows on iTunes. The show currently has an average rating of 4. 5 out of 5 on iTunes, based on 102 ratings. “Imagine listening to Jesus Christ, only more fabulous” said one reviewer. Another, more detailed iTunes user wrote: “Milo Yiannopoulos, the premier cultural critic and activist of social media has come to prominence with his style of didactic and poshness. At a time when society is beholden to a minority of self appointed cultural monitors, Milo confronts sanctimony with logic, and dogma with rapier Wit. ” Commenting on the podcast’s success, Breitbart News    Alex Marlow said “Milo is the conservative voice of the moment and podcasts are the audio medium of moment. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the Milo Yiannopoulos Show opened with such a resounding response. Congrats to the teams of Breitbart News and Podcast One. ” Breitbart CEO Larry Solov said  “The early success of The Milo Yiannopoulos Show is another indication that   web users are hungry for voices who challenge the prevailing liberal narratives of the political and media establishment. Breitbart will continue to produce smart, entertaining content that speaks directly to that audience. ”
