On Friday, HBO’s “Real Time” host Bill Maher, who is supporting Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) but has previously dismissed the story about Clinton’s emails, said that Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email conduct “wasn’t good. ” And that the Clintons can’t “fool rubes” like they did in Arkansas.  Maher stated of the email scandal that the State Department IG’s report “wasn’t good. ” Adding, “Now, like with all Clinton scandals, what they actually do is never that bad.   …     It’s always how they handle it. And I think what the problem is, is that these two cut their teeth in Arkansas, and they got used to being able to fool rubes  …    easily, and it doesn’t work that way in DC. ” Earlier, while interviewing Sanders, Maher said, “I still don’t think she committed some horrible crime, but that story has moved a little bit, has it not?” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
