Monday on Fox New Channel’s “Hannity,” Peter Schweizer, the author of “Clinton Cash,” said presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton protected and promoted outgoing DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) for her “dirty work” as revealed by thousand of hacked emails released by Wikileaks which showed a bias against Clinton’s rival Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ).  Schweizer said,”It’s very interesting because it he has revealed the underbelly, the seeming underbelly of the Democratic party but shows us something about Hillary Clinton herself. Who else in modern American politics would take somebody like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and say, ‘You know what? She’s going to quit but we’re going to give her a promotion and bring her to the campaign.’ The Clintons are masterful at doubling down. If you do dirty work for them as she did at the DNC against Bernie Sanders we’re going to take care of you, protect you and promote you. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
