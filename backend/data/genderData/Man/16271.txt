A city in Idaho is looking for vandals who destroyed a   bell used to honor veterans at a memorial. [The vandals destroyed the memorial based in Coeur d’Alene by rocking “Pappy’s Bell” back and forth until it detached from the holster and crashed to the ground, CNN reported.  “This is a horrible act and we’re very sad to see that this happened, particularly so close to Veterans Day, when our local vets will be in this plaza to recognize all of our troops,” the city said on its Facebook page. Damage to the bell, which was donated to Coeur d’Alene in the 1950s, is estimated at $15, 000 if it can be repaired, deputy city administrator Sam Taylor told KBOI. The city has released photos of the suspects and the damage on its Facebook page.
