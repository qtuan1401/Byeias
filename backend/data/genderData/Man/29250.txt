Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton ( ) stated that some members of the Congressional Black Caucus were disappointed that President Obama did not nominate black woman to the Supreme Court because “the only black we have on the court is a black man who’s the most conservative member of the court” on Friday’s “Place for Politics” on MSNBC.  Norton said that some members of the Congressional Black Caucus “thought that maybe we could get a black woman. Remember, the only black we have on the court is a black man who’s the most conservative member of the court. So there was some disappointment. On the other hand, no member of the black caucus has come out against Merrick  —   this nominee, because we don’t know anything about him. So, where we stand is we want a hearing, so we can find out something about him. ” (  Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
