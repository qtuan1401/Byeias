’  ’ ’   DARPA just gave a paralyzed man back the sense of touch   through the use of a brain implant. ’ ”   It’s a revolutionary breakthrough for the Pentagon’s research and   development shop, which hooked up a human subject named Nathan   Copeland  controlled by a brain implant that could   send information back and forth. ” ’   Copeland was paralyzed from the chest down after a 2004 car   accident. Nearly ten years later, he volunteered for a clinical   trial that provided him the feeling ”as if his own hand were   being touched,” he reported. ’ ”   In order to make that feeling happen, DARPA researchers from the   University of Pittsburgh implanted four microelectrode arrays   onto the areas of Copeland’s brain that dealt with motor   functions and the sense of feeling in the fingers and palm. Then   they hooked wires up to a robotic arm and tested, which resulted   in nearly 100 percent accuracy. ” ”   “At one point, instead of pressing one finger, the team decided   to press two without telling him,” Dr. Justin Sanchez, the   director of DARPA’s Biological Technologies Office, said in a   statement. “He responded in jest asking whether somebody was   trying to play a trick on him. That is when we knew that the   feelings he was perceiving through the robotic hand were    . ” ” ”   The latest advance is just one of many in DARPA’s   Revolutionizing Prosthetics program, an initiative that started   in 2006. The  a   prosthetic arm   that looks, feels, and acts just like a real human arm. ” ’   Check out the video: ’ ’ ’ ’     ’
