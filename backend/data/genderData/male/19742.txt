Wednesday on CNN’s “Newsroom,”   journalist Carl Bernstein said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is losing to her opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) because of character, to which he described has led to him as “clobbering her. ”  Bernstein said, “Well, I think it might not be wise if it literally is to be more aggressive about Bernie Sanders. She is running a terribly flawed campaign as a terribly flawed candidate. And she has got to find her voice and get her record and her persona out there. It’s a great record of a lifetime. He has put forth his character, his movement, and it’s gotten traction. And he’s clobbering her. This is an election between the two of them that really is about character and principle. Obama just gave a great speech in which I would think he was saying to both the Democrats and the Republicans, hey, calm down. Let’s have a   debate. And right now, Sanders has run a campaign that seems to have captured the zeitgeist. And the Hillary Clinton is really flailing and looking for an opening. And the real opening, I think, is the record of her life. Mistakes, excess baggage, all of it. But the distrust question, truthfulness is killing her right now. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
