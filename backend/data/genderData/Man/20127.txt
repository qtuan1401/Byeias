On Wednesday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM, Ed Martin, the president of the Eagle Forum, revealed that his organization’s offices were vandalized on the day after founder Phyllis Schlafly’s death. [Martin told the story in response to Breitbart    Alex Marlow’s observation that “we’ve now gotten to this nasty point in society where we must be so nasty to one another, we cannot simply disagree and debate civilly  —   that we must be jerks. ”  “I’m not sure I have the answer about how we got there, but I do think you’ve pointed to something that Phyllis Schlafly taught me, and maybe taught the country, and could teach again,” Martin said. “Even in the last day or so, there’s been vicious things said,” he continued. “I’ll tell you, maybe it’s a bit of news I don’t think anybody even knew or reported: The building where we work out of, a beautiful   brick building, was   the day of her death. The morning, we got to work the next day, with slurs, and comments, and all nasty stuff from the Left. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
