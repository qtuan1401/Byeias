During a Friday HBO “Real Time” conversation with Sen. Ben Sasse ( ) host Bill Maher joked that he is not a “house n**ga” when the senator suggested he come work in the fields of Nebraska.  Partial transcript as follows: MAHER: Halloween used to be a kid thing. SASSE: It’s not anymore? MAHER: Not out here. Adults dress up for Halloween. They don’t do that in Nebraska? SASSE: It’s frowned upon. Yeah, we don’t do that quite as much. MAHER: I’ve got to get to Nebraska more. SASSE: You’re welcome. We’d love to have you work in the fields for us. MAHER: Work in the fields? Senator, I’m a house nigga [applause]. It’s a joke! Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
