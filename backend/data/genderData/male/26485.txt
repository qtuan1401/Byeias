An odd video shot in June is suddenly going viral.  In the video, a group of hunters in the Australian Outback were helping a young cancer patient fulfill his last wish of catching a wild boar with his dogs when a kangaroo collided with one of the dogs and was wrestling with it. One of the hunters rushes over to the two animals, and the kangaroo let go of the dog. The kangaroo then squares up to the man, who then punches the animal in the face. Stunned, the kangaroo assesses the situation before finally retreating. One of the men on the hunting trip described the experience as follows: One day while hunting one of the highly trained dogs was chasing some pigs by scent and collided with a big buck kangaroo that then held and wrestled the dog by its protective gear (boars have tusks like knives) the owner was horrified that his dog or the kangaroo would get hurt and run in to save both parties. You can see the dog trying to escape, wanting nothing to do with the kangaroo. The big buck kangaroo releases the dog when the owner gets close but then moves in to try and attack the human. The punch stops the roo and makes him think about the situation, giving the owner and the dog time to disengage from the big wild animal and leaving it to hop off and I suppose wonder about what just happened. We laughed at the absurdity of the situation and at how unfortunate it was for the dog and kangaroo. Our    inch friend felt no malice to the kangaroo but had to step in and fix a bad situation before it got worse. Young Kailem unfortunately lost his brave battle with cancer two days ago, so this hunt is part of the treasured memories his family and friends have. Having a dog get tangled up with a roo was never our aim or intention and we were happy no animals were hurt in the incident. (  KFOR) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
