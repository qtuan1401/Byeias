Former President Bill Clinton explained that Hillary Clinton has fainted before, as a result of dehydration, not any serious medical issue. [Clinton said that “on more than one occasion” over the years of her career ”the same sort of thing’s happened to her when she got severely dehydrated. ”  The former president made his comments during an interview with CBS reporter Charlie Rose, after his wife Hillary Clinton collapsed suddenly during a   tribute ceremony in New York City and was forced to summon her campaign van. Rose was skeptical, pointing out that the video appeared to be something more serious than dehydration. “Well if it is, it’s a mystery to me and all of her doctors,” Clinton said. “Rarely, but on more than one occasion over the last many, many years the same sort of thing has happened to her when she just got severely dehydrated. ” Clinton suggested that her fatigue was the result of her busy career and time spent on the trail, but suggested that his wife was merely “dizzy. ” “She’s worked like a demon as you know as Secretary of State and as a Senator and in the years since,” he said. “She had two and a half hard days before the day she got dizzy. ” He insisted that Hillary was doing much better after resting at home and would be back on the campaign trail sooner than expected. “She was even better last night before she went to sleep, she got a good night’s sleep,” Clinton said.
