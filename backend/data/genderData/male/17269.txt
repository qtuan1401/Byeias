PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   Special police units in this border state seized two trucks modified with makeshift armor. The armored trucks are commonly used by cartel members operating near the Texas border. [Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas and Coahuila to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by Coahuila’s “JM Martinez”.  The most recent seizure took place early in the morning on Tuesday when members of the Fuerza Coahuila police force were carrying out foot patrols near the area known as Sierra de Acuña. The mountainous region is immediately south of the rural area between Del Rio and Big Bend National Park. In an effort to slow down Mexican drug cartels, Fuerza Coahuila has been actively patrolling the mountainous area just south of the Texas border resulting in numerous seizures. Despite being a busy drug corridor, the Department of Homeland Security assigns minimal resources and agents to patrol the area.  During the search operation, authorities spotted a black Chevrolet Silverado that had been hidden within the brush near a a creek between Colorado Canyon and Cibolito Canyon in the area known as Los Panchos Ranch. Authorities checked the vehicles and noticed that it had plates of steel and bullet proof glass as armor covering the passenger area, the motor and the rear part. Earlier this year authorities discovered another armored truck in the same general area. Armored trucks are commonly used by cartel gunmen during clashes with military and police forces in various border cities.
