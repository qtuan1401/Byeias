Hillary Clinton is joining with husband Bill and daughter Chelsea for her final stand in Iowa the night before the Monday caucus. [Clinton is running    in Iowa with Bernie Sanders, who has pulled to within the margin of error in both the Iowa State    poll and also the final Des Moines Register poll.  Sanders held a concert Saturday night in the college town of Iowa City with the band Vampire Weekend. Bill Clinton was in Iowa City Sunday at a smaller event. Clinton’s campaign again sucked up to President Obama in hyping the Sunday night event featuring all three Clintons at Abraham Lincoln High School in Des Moines, beginning at 6:30 PM Central Time. “Hillary is the fighter Democrats can trust to stand up to a Republican party that threatens to rip away the progress that’s been made during President Obama’s Administration. She has spent her career fighting for children and families and as President she’ll continue to get results,” the campaign stated on its website. Clinton is battling fallout from the revelation that 22 highly classified emails were found by investigators on her unsecure   email server that she used for personal business and the nation’s business while holding the job of Secretary of State.   Sanders has a   lead over Clinton in New Hampshire, according to a recent poll, and could also run competitively against Clinton with black voters in South Carolina, making Iowa a   for Clinton.
