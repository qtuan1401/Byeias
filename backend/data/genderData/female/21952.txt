A woman arrested for having child porn on her cell phone gave the FBI a unique excuse for collecting the images. It was, she allegedly said, a “coping mechanism. ”[Imperial, Pennsylvania, resident Kaitlin Plascjak, 28, was arrested after the FBI received a tip about what they might find on her phone and home computers, according to PennLive. com.  But upon her arrest, Plascjak had a ready excuse for officials. She reportedly said she began to view and collect child porn in 2006 as a way to cope because she was molested as a child. According to a police report, Plascjak said that she “has no children and viewing child pornography is a coping mechanism for her because she was molested when she was younger. ” The criminal complaint says that chat application Skype reported that child porn images were transmitted to a device linked to an IP address at the home in which Plascjak was living. An investigation revealed several other instances, as well. Authorities found up to 100 images of children exposing themselves and engaging in sexual conduct. Some of the images even depicted infants being sexually molested. A spokesman for the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office noted Plascjak is the first woman arrested on child pornography charges in the 16 years the office has been working with the FBI Crimes Against Children and Cyber Crimes task forces.
