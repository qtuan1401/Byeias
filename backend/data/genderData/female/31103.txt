A Playboy Playmate could face up to six months in prison for publicly sharing a photo of a naked woman at the gym. [Dani Mathers, 29, posted a photo of the naked woman on Snapchat in July at an L. A. Fitness gym with the caption, “If I can’t unsee this then you can’t either. ”  Now that the woman in the photo has come forward to police, Mathers could face up to six months behind bars on a misdemeanor dissemination of private images charge, TMZ reported. Mathers  —   accidentally, she says  —   shared an image of a naked woman showering at an L. A. Fitness gym alongside a picture of her laughing at the woman to the public. She got a lot of flack for sharing the image, and issued an apology over Twitter and in a video on Snapchat after deleting the image. In her video apology, she claimed that the image was meant to be sent privately to a friend and said, “I have chosen to do what I do because I love the female body and I know that   is wrong and it’s not what I’m about. It’s not the type of person that I am. ” She then deleted her Twitter and Instagram accounts. Breitbart previously reported that Mathers lost her   gig on KLOS 95. 5’s “Heidi and Frank” show, and was banned for life from using L. A. Fitness’ facilities. The Los Angeles Police Department opened a criminal investigation into the incident and asked the woman in the picture to come forward and aid in the investigation.
