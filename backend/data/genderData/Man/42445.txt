The actor and musician’s   estate and ”private village” in the south of France is for sale. The asking price: $25. 76 million.  Depp’s home in Plan de la Tour    near Saint      includes a private ”hameau” or small Provencal village featuring a main house, guest cottages, a chapel, a bar and restaurant, and other structures. There are 12  bedrooms and 12 full baths listed, among the more than 10, 000  square feet of living space.  Sotheby’s International Realty, the listing agency, says Depp ”painstakingly restored and decorated all the houses, one by one” and has invested more than $10 million on it.
