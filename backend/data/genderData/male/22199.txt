A high school student in Arizona is in trouble after his yearbook prank was discovered, says a Fox 4 KC report.  When the Red Mountain High School football team went to take its team photograph last year, Hunter Osborn, who was    at the time, exposed himself. Osborn says he was dared by a teammate to expose himself for the picture. The photograph then ended up in the school yearbook, which was distributed about 3, 400 times. It was not until after the yearbooks were distributed that the prank was found. Osborn faces 69 counts of indecent exposure, a class 1 misdemeanor,  and one count of furnishing harmful items to minors, which is a class 4 felony. The 69 counts of indecent exposure are for every person present when the team photo was taken. The amount of charges could change if anybody from the photo decides to drop the charges, if they are 18 or older, or if more people come forward with complaints. The school released the following statement: “The district is dismayed by the actions of the students involved in the photograph. Their behavior does not reflect the values of Red Mountain High School or Mesa Public Schools. Upon learning of the photograph, school administration immediately contacted police and is cooperating fully with the investigation. Disciplinary action will follow policy and may be based on the outcome of the police investigation. The school and district are conducting an investigation to determine what actions might have prevented the publication of the photograph, so appropriate safeguards can be put in place going forward. While the small size of the photograph as published makes the details difficult to discern, the yearbook has been recalled so the school can make a minor but critical edit for the inappropriate content. ” Osborn was released after being fitted with an electronic monitor.
