While introducing his executive gun control today, President Obama suggested Americans “are not inherently more prone to violence” than citizens of other nations. Film director Michael Moore took issue with this, countering that Americans “start wars” and use drones to “bomb civilians. ”[Moore did this via Twitter, where he wrote: “[Obama] said that we Americans aren’t more violent than others. But we r. We start wars. We drone bomb civilians. ”  Moore also quoted highly exaggerated numbers on mass shootings, claiming that “we had 330+ mass shootings in 2015. ” Breitbart News previously reported on a column by Mother Jones editor Mark Follman in which Follman explained that the left has inflated the number of mass shootings by immense proportions. So while Moore says “330+ mass shoootings” and actress Rose McGowan claims “355,” Follman puts the number at 4. That’s correct —  4 (four). Writing in The New York Times, Follman explained: At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have complied an     database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four “mass shootings” this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982. This is not exciting news for people pushing gun control, but the truth is not always exciting. Sometimes it’s just true. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
