BuzzFeed is cancer, but sometimes cancer gets it right. Here’s BuzzFeed UK correspondent James Ball on Nigel Farage, who Ball declares a “winner” of EU Referendum.  Farage, who has led UKIP for most of the last decade, has seen his party rise to around 13% of the national vote, and despite conceding the referendum result early in the evening,     and   again, has found himself on the winning side of the vote.
