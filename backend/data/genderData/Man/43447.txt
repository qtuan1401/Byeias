’  ’ ”   If you want to snag a job or an internship at a top company,   you’d better have a stellar résumé. ” ’   Jessica Pointing, a Harvard junior who won internship offers from   companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, McKinsey,   Bain, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, previously told Business   Insider about . ’ ’   Here, Pointing  —   who  on her website,     —   explained to Business Insider how to write   a killer CV: ’ ”   Don’t treat your résumé as an opportunity to just list all your   past work experiences. ” ’   ”Include how you impacted the company or organization you worked   for,” Pointing says. ”This is important because many people only   describe their past jobs. What’’s more important is demonstrating   how you contributed to that job.” ’ ’’ ’   ”It’’s important to quantify your achievements when possible,” she   says. ”For example, if you saved the company $10, 000, include   that number instead of saying, ’’I was an exceptional employee. ’’   Including something tangible, concrete, and quantifiable really   helps.” ’ ’   ”Don’’t include anything that you are uncomfortable talking about   during an interview,” Pointing says. ”In your résumé, you may   want to embellish it and include, for example, all these   languages that you speak and all these programming languages you   understand. In an interview, the interviewer might ask about any   of that.” ’ ’   Pointing says she once included list of classes she had taken on   her résumé, including a biology course. ’ ’   ”My interviewer had a PhD. in biology, so he started asking me   about the technical aspects of the course,” she says. ”I had   taken it a year ago and I didn’’t remember all the details.” ’
