HBO’s “Real Time” host Bill Maher wondered, “Where are the liberals” to stand up for those in the Muslim world who, because of Islamic extremism can’t come out of the closet, leave the faith, or draw a cartoon, and why people on the left “are not to be heard” on the gender apartheid in the Muslim world on Friday.  Maher began by sating, “I thought Barack Obama really nailed it when he said, about eight years ago, that Americans cling to their guns and their religion, because this tragedy was brought to you by guns and religion. ” He added that only one religion bombs and kills gay people, saying, “Yes, the God hates f*gs people show up with placards and posters, and they’re despicable, but they don’t show up with guns and bombs. That’s just the world as it is today. The answer is not to ban Muslims, however. The answer is to ask more of Muslims, I think. ” Later in the show, Maher stated that bringing up suicides by gay people in response to the Orlando attack is comparing apples and oranges. He further said that too many people “think of the 3 million Muslims in America, who by the way, are the lucky ones because they can come out of the closet, or they can elope with someone who is not of their faith, or they can leave the religion, or they draw a cartoon without getting killed. This is not the case for so many millions of Muslims around the world. Where are the liberals to stand up for them? The people who could not abide apartheid for one second. Somehow, when it comes to gender apartheid, which is in so many countries around the world, they are not to be heard. It is a liberal cause, or it should be. There are millions and millions of Muslims who are gay around the world, who have no one to stand up for them, and I didn’t hear any of it this week. None of it this week. In 10 Muslim countries, you get the death penalty for just being gay. Could we have a little perspective on this issue? Size matters. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
