 (CNN) Here is a look at the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season.  Facts:The 2016 Atlantic hurricane season ran from June 1 to November 30. The areas covered include the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.  The National Weather Service defines a hurricane as ”an intense tropical weather system with   circulation and sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher.”  Hurricanes are rated according to intensity on the   Hurricane Wind Scale.  The   scale estimates potential property damage.  A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane.  The National Hurricane Center advises preparedness: A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours.  A hurricane warning indicates that sustained winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours.
