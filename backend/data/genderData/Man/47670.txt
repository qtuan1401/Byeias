’  ’ ’     Every winter, the population of  (Carcharodon carcharias) that roams     and feeds along the coastline from Central to Baja California     disappears deep into the Pacific Ocean —  swimming for 30 to 40     days to reach a point approximately halfway between Mexico and     Hawaii.   ’ ’     There’s not a lot going for this particular spot in the ocean.     It’s about 3000 —  5000 meters deep, and pretty barren as far as     foodstuffs go. But the massive sharks —  which can reach lengths     of nearly 22 feet —  stay there from about April to July,     clustered in an area smaller than Panama. When the males     arrive, they start diving up to 200 meters, repeatedly, up to     150 times a day.   ’ ’     And what they’re doing is anyone’s guess.  a     scientist with the  was one of several     researchers to first identify this mysterious region     in . He the ‘white     shark café’ because he suspects the sharks are going there to     catch something to eat. Alternatively, they could be making the     trip to meet that special someone.   ’ ’     “I think of it like Burning Man,” Jorgensen said. “You have all     these Bay Area white sharks, and every year they head out into     this white shark café, out into the desert of the ocean —  and     we’re not exactly sure what they’re doing out there. ”   ’ ’     To find out, he and  an engineer with the Monterey Bay     Aquarium Research Institute () teamed up to develop     a camera tag that can record video in low light, chart depths     and acceleration, track the shark’s location, and monitor tail     beats like a FitBit counts steps —  all while submerged under     corrosive sea water, sometimes to depths of more than 1000     meters.   ’ ’     Maughan’s rigged up a prototype composed of an        camera used to film offroad car races, commercial animal     satellite tags, and innovative workarounds like       LEDs to keep microbes from gumming up the lens and the     machinery. The battery has enough juice to power about 10 hours     of video recording, and they’re working on an algorithm that     would turn the camera on when the movement sensors detect the     sharks start the strange diving behavior that says they’ve     arrived at the white shark café (which would allow more     effective deployment of the battery life).   ’ ’     The tag itself goes on the dorsal fin, which Maughan calls     nature’s tripod. But getting a camera tag on a shark’s dorsal     fin isn’t an easy task.   ’ ’     “We put out a silhouette of a seal that’s made out of outdoor     carpeting, and we trail that behind the boat,” explains     Jorgensen.  “And pretty soon we’ll get some interest from     the shark that will come up and investigate the decoy, and we     reel that in —  it’s a little like fly fishing,” he says —  if the     fish you’re after is enormous. When the shark is circling the     boat, they reach over the side with a 12 foot applicator pole     and release the camera tag’s clamp onto the dorsal fin. “It’s     really exciting —  but it’s hard, your adrenaline is pumping,”     Jorgensen says.   ’ ’     The first time Maughan went out with a crew tagging these     sharks, he says he was tasked with photographing sharks’ dorsal     fins, which can help scientists ID the sharks. “My mind was not     prepared for how big around it was,” Maughan says. “When it     came out of the water I recoiled a bit —  and I took a lot of     pictures of the sky,” although he did ultimately get a few     photos of the dorsal fin. “Holy cow, that’s a sizeable animal. ”   ’ ’  ’ ’     Retrieving the cameras should be simpler —  once the sharks return     to the California coast in late summer, the tag is designed to     fall off and float to the surface where a satellite transmitter     powered by solar cells signals its location to the research     team so they can retrieve it and the data it contains.   ’ ’     Right now, Maughan is testing the camera on swimming robots in     the laboratory and in Monterey Bay, and in the fall they plan     to do short tests on sharks when they return to the California     coast after their annual pilgrimage. Then, in fall 2017, they     hope to roll out around 20 of these tags to start watching what     is really going on at this mysterious shark gathering place in     the middle of the Pacific.   ’ ’     “We’ve lived with this narrative of white sharks being these     mindless vagrants,” Jorgensen says. “But the more you study     them, you realize that they have these very particular     patterns. ”   ’ ’     “And this white shark café is one of the most intriguing and     mysterious —  what are they doing out there?”   ’ ’     Jorgensen’s work will be featured in a documentary     called  airing     during the Discovery Channel’s Shark Week.   ’
