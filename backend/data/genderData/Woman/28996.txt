[Obama was asked about her opinion of Clinton during a “Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day” event at the White House.  “I think Hillary Clinton is a phenomenal woman,” Michelle Obama said. “And I’ve gotten to know her and I think she’s made some pretty major contributions over the course of her life. ” Obama said that she would not run for president like Hillary, but rather seek for other ways to serve the community after leaving the White House. “Hillary Clinton is an impressive woman and I will not do what she has done, I will not run for president,” she said.
