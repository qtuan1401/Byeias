Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders are having a   split following the leak of a recording in which Clinton disparaged Sanders’ younger supporters. [Instead of having joint events on Monday, Sanders is going to Iowa and Wisconsin on Wednesday, reports TheHill. com.  The split gives the establishment media three days to shift their attention away from Clinton’s recorded speech, where she showed contempt for Senders’ supporters. “There’s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we’ve done hasn’t gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don’t know what it means but it is something that they deeply feel,” she said. Despite the     of his voters by his primary rival, Sanders was still backing Clinton on Sunday. “Well, I agree with her, what she is saying,” he said on CNN. “There are young people who went deeply into debt, worked very hard to get a good education, and yet get out of school and can’t get decent jobs   …     and are living in their parents’ basements. There is a point there. ”
