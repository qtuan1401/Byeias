 (CNN) Two US Marine jets collided midair over water near San Diego on Wednesday shortly before noon.  One pilot ejected from the aircraft while the other landed safely at a nearby air station, according to the Marine Corps Air Station based in Miramar, California. The two pilots are in stable condition, according to a statement from the Marine Corps. Both aircraft, described as      Hornets, were on a training mission and are based at the Miramar station, just north of San Diego. The pilot who ejected from the jet was rescued at 12:41 p. m. about 30 minutes after rescue teams received a distress signal, according to the Marine Corps.  A    team from the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson rescued the pilot.  The other pilot landed at Naval Air Station North Island, which is just south of San Diego.   The cause of the crash is under investigation. In July, a Marine pilot who had also been based at Miramar was killed when his    Hornet crashed during training.
