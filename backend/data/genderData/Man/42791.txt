 (The Hollywood Reporter) Han Solo is back. At the ”Star Wars: The Force Awakens” panel Friday, Harrison Ford is making his first public appearance since his plane crash in March. ”I’m fine,” he told the crowd, who broke out into bellowing screams and applause when he took the stage. ”I walked here so how bad can it be?” The actor, who reprises his iconic role in the upcoming ”Star Wars” film, suffered multiple injuries  —   including a broken pelvis and broken ankle  —   after his   World War   plane had to make an emergency landing on a Venice golf course March 5. He was unable to attend the Star Wars Celebration convention in April. Ford, 72, took the stage along with several stars of the upcoming film, whose director, J. J. Abrams, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy led the hotly anticipated panel. ”Star Wars”    footage raises questions, ”It should have felt ridiculous,” he said when asked about how it felt to return to the set of a ”Star Wars” movie. ”It was thirty plus years ago and I sorta grew up. Yet here I was. I will tell you that it felt great.” How 3000 fake weapons make it through   security, Ford also was hurt on the set of The Force Awakens when his ankle was injured by the door of the Millennium Falcon, the spacecraft that his character pilots in the original films. ”The originals that I was part of, it was the beginning of my working life,” Ford added. ”I was very grateful for the opportunity for the success of the film.” Batman to team up with Ninja Turtles, ”Star Wars: The Force Awakens” hits theaters Dec. 18.
