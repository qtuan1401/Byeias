Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) admitted Sunday night that “Democrats are not always right. ”[Clinton has been hitting Sanders for his opposition to the   Bank, and accusing him of being on the side of Republicans on the issue. His position, “makes absolutely no sense,” she claimed during the Sunday night CNN Democratic debate.  “I don’t want to break the bad news —  Democrats are not always right,” Sanders responded Sunday evening at the debate, held in Flint, Michigan. “Democrats have often supported corporate welfare, Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements. On this issue I do not believe in corporate welfare,” he said. “I think we’re in a race for exports,” Clinton said about the   bank for exporters. “Here in Michigan, there’s been $11 billion in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small business. I favor it  —   he opposes it. ” Sanders also argued that the bank is  “the Bank of Boeing” in Washington, D. C. and that most of their loans amount to welfare for big corporations.
