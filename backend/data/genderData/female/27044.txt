Hillary Clinton’s doctor says she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday, and was “overheated and dehydrated” at the   commemoration event Sunday morning, where cameras caught her stumbling and then being placed into a van by her security details. [“I have just examined here and she is now   and recovering nicely,” according to a statement attributed to her doctor, Dr. Lisa Bardack.  “Secretary Clinton has been experience a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated,” said the statement. The diagnosis of pneumonia was not mentioned in earlier Sunday statements from her staff for her apparent collapse. “Secretary Clinton attended the September 11th Commemoration Ceremony for just an hour and thirty minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen,” spokesman Nick Merrill said in a morning statement. “During the ceremony, she felt overheated so [she] departed to go to her daughter’s apartment, and is feeling much better. ”
