The Republican National Committee says that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton should be disqualified from the race. [“The FBI’s decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s secret email server just eleven days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be,” RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement:  This stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law. What’s indisputable is that Hillary Clinton jeopardized classified information on thousands of occasions in her reckless attempt to hide    corruption at her State Department. This alone should be disqualifying for anyone seeking the presidency, a job that is supposed to begin each morning with a top secret intelligence briefing. FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress Friday saying that “recent developments” prompted him to continue his agency’s investigation into Clinton’s unauthorized use of a private, homebrew email server stored in her bathroom that she used to conduct official state business. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed by on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,” he wrote. The FBI has Clinton’s “backup device” in its possession. The New York Times reports that the additional emails were discovered during the investigation of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s sexting. Weiner is top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s estranged husband.
