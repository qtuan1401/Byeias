 (CNN) It’s no secret that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has a young, liberal fanbase that shows its devotion in distinctly millennial ways. Her positions on wage parity,   marriage and women’s rights (to name a few) have earned her the nickname ”The Notorious R. B. G.” thanks to a Tumblr of the same name dedicated to her. There are tattoos, muscle tees and YouTube serenades paying homage to the   justice, who has been on the nation’s highest bench for 21 years    longer than some of her followers have been alive. So it seems appropriate that her fans would celebrate her 82nd with social media memes, the Internet’s favorite tool for   public figures. Here are some of the tributes wishing Justice Ginsburg a #NotoriousBday.
