Sunday, on New York’s AM 970 “The Cats Roundtable,” Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz ripped the culture of college campuses today in America.  He called college students “humorless” over safe spaces, political correctness and the war against free speech. [Relevant portion begins at the 7:12 mark] “They want a safe space for their ideas, well fine, don’t go to college don’t go to universities. Universities are not gonna give you a safe space for your ideas. Your ideas are gonna be challenged. Whether they’re ideas about sex, rape, consent, race, religion, terrorism  —   every one of your ideas are gonna be challenged,” Dershowitz said. “This idea of safe spaces and stopping yourself from being   what does that mean? My God, sense of humor has disappeared from college campuses. ” “We have to restore sense of humor, get back to where every idea is freely expressed on campus, no matter how offensive it is to anybody, and where there’s no political correctness,” he continued. “Universities and departments of universities should not take positions on political issues. They shouldn’t tell their students who to vote for, who to support when theres an issue like Israel and Palenstine, they shouldn’t tell their students to support affirmative action based on race. Students are free to come up with their own ideas. The universities should not be dictating what their students believe on any issue. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
