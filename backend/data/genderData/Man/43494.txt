’  ’ ’   The automakers reported January sales on Wednesday, and most   notched declines compared with the same month last year. ’ ”   But that doesn’t mean the US market is experiencing the first   signs that a multiyear,   boom is ending. ” ’   Rather, the boom continues. ”January sales fell 1. 8 percent to   1. 14 million vehicles, or a seasonally adjusted annualized rate   of 17. 61 million vehicles, down from 17. 9 million vehicles a year   earlier, according to Autodata,” . ’ ’   ”The annualized rate was roughly in line with the forecast of   17. 55 million in a poll of 40 economists by Thomson Reuters.” ’ ”   That predicted annualized rate would have matched 2016’s     performance. But it didn’t match it  —   it beat it. ” ’   Two positive factors contributed to January sales, which are   typically weak compared to other months. ’ ’   First, pickups and SUVs are selling much better than passenger   cars. This means that even if sales decline      profits can be maintained. Pickups and SUVs simply make more   money for the automakers. ’ ’   Second, automakers are getting disciplined about   ”fleet   sales”  —   largely passengers cars sold to rental agencies,   governments, and organizations. Fleet sales can juice the sales   numbers, but retail sales to consumers are much more profitable. ’ ’   So there you have it. The auto sales boom in the US continues,   and automaker profitability looks as if it will benefit for the   foreseeable future. The downturn, of course, will come. But it   might not come in 2017. ’ ’  ’ ’The automakers reported January sales on. ..’
