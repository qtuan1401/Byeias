Moore wrote the following caption for the photos: I have a right to feel safe in my home and to protect myself. I don’t care if I’m on TV. What if 3 strangers banged on your front door   …    2 of them being grown men wearing dark clothing knowing they could only get to you by jumping fences or trespassing onto other properties and mine? There are home invasions, robberies, rapist  …    What if your children or loved ones were threatened this way? Anyone who is bold enough to commit a crime, endanger themselves and others needs to be punished. According to the Atlanta   Moore said the three suspects arrived in a white car and “the female was recording on her phone. ” Moore stressed, “It is never ok to violate anyone this way.
