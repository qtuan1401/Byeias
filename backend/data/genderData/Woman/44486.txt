’  ’ ”   I sometimes do this thing where I agree in advance to meet up and   then back out at the last minute  —   because I’m tired, because I’m   overwhelmed, or because I never really wanted to hang in the   first place. ” ”   It’s not something I’m proud of, but it’s the truth. ” ’   Dan Ariely  —   a Duke University behavioral economist whose time is   a lot more in demand than mine  —   has a simple solution to this   problem.
