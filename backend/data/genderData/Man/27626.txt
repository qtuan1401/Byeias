A man was arrested and charged with using hidden cameras to secretly record adults and children undressing and using a bathroom in a home in Merrimack, New Hampshire, authorities reported. [Police arrested Thomas Herrmann, 52, and charged him with six counts of privacy violation after an investigation revealed videos of people undressing stored on his computer.  Officials did not confirm in whose home Herrmann had allegedly hidden the recording equipment or how he was able to carry out the hiding of the cameras. Some of the individuals on the recordings, police said, are under the age of 18. At least six of the underage teens have been identified, and police have contacted them and their parents, according to New England Cable News. Merrimack Police Lieutenant Denise Roy discussed the videos that sparked their investigation and the eventual arrest of Herrmann: “Whenever we get egregious crimes like this, we put all our efforts into protecting the children as best we can,” Roy said. Herrmann is being held on $25, 000 cash bail and was arraigned in Merrimack District Court this week. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.
