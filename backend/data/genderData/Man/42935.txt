 (CNN) Singer Chris Brown left the Philippines on Friday after a contract dispute initially prevented him from departing the country. The    singer headed out for Hong Kong at 9:30 p. m. local time, Eric Apolinario, a spokesman for the  Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, told CNN. A video posted to Brown’s Twitter account seemed to corroborate the departure. ”Manila, it was fun. I love y’all man,” the singer said in the video. The Philippine Department of Justice said it issued an order earlier this week to prevent Brown from leaving the country over a contract dispute. Before leaving the Philippines, Brown protested that he had nothing to do with the contract dispute.

Brown is scheduled to appear Friday night in Macau. Tickets are almost $600.
