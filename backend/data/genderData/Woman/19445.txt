Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while discussing the new movie “13 Hours,” on the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton saidquestioned the “dramatization. ”  When asked if she believes everything was done that night to rescue ambassador Stevens and the other three Americans, Clinton said, “Based on everything I know and based on a   intelligence committee investigation,  a   arms services committee investigation, the answer to that is yes. That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything. I can’t speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization. I testified for more than 11 hours, as you know. I  answered every question I was asked. My real focus, chuck, is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harm’s way  —   military or civilian, diplomats or soldiers  —   we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
