 (CNN) More than a month after calling off her wedding, Bristol Palin revealed what she called ”big news” in a blog post on Thursday: She’s pregnant with her second child. ”I know this has been, and will be, a huge disappointment to my family, to my close friends, and to many of you,” Palin wrote in a post on her blog, noting that she was making the announcement sooner than expected because online trolls ”have nothing better to talk about.” The news comes after former vice presidential hopeful and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said in May that her daughter was calling off her wedding to 2011 Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer less than a week before the big day. ”I wanted you guys to be the first to know that I am pregnant,” Bristol Palin’s Thursday blog post said. ”Honestly, I’ve been trying my hardest to keep my chin up on this one.” Bristol Palin has stayed in the public eye since her mother’s failed vice presidential bid through appearances on ”Dancing With the Stars” and a Lifetime show about raising her son, ”Bristol Palin: Life’s a Tripp.” Bristol Palin’s wedding called off, She also released a   memoir in 2011, ”Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far.” She was previously engaged to Tripp’s father, Levi Johnston. Asking for privacy Thursday, she said her faith in God was guiding her through a tough time. ”I do not want any lectures, and I do not want any sympathy. My little family has, and always will come first,” she wrote. ”Tripp, this new baby, and I will all be fine, because God is merciful.”
