’  ’ ’   Trivago, the online hotel reservation company backed by Expedia,   is expected to list its shares in New York by the end of   November, according to people familiar with the matter. ’ ’   Expedia, which owns a majority stake in Trivago, has hired   JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley to run the flotation,   which will take place on the Nasdaq.  ’ ”   The deal size wasn’t immediately clear, but one person said that   Trivago had initially told bankers it was interested in raising   as much as $1 billion. That would make it the largest tech   IPO in the US this year, and  —   to this person  —   is a   stretch.  ” ’   Expedia said in July that it would explore an IPO of   Trivago, with an aim to list the shares by the end of   the year.  ’ ’   ”An IPO would allow investors to value Trivago as a separate   standalone company,” Expedia’’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at   the time. ”Expedia does not plan to sell any of our   shares in an IPO, and there are no guarantees that an IPO will   ultimately be pursued or be successful.” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Once the offering document is public, the company has to wait   three weeks before the share sale can proceed. Trivago could   make its filing public as soon as next week in order to list   by Thanksgiving.  ’ ’   An IPO in late November would be dependent on investor appetite   for new shares following the US presidential election. The   flotation could be derailed by a volatile market. ’ ’   ’ ’  ’
