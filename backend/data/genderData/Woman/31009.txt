Today’s WikiLeaks dump of over 19, 000 emails from the Democratic National Committee has vindicated a longstanding complaint of Bernie Sanders  —   that the DNC actively worked against him and his campaign against Hillary Clinton. [In one email, dated May 5, 2016, DNC Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall suggested emphasizing Sanders’ atheism, as the information would damage his image with Southern Baptists.  It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist. In another email, to DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda, Democrat national press secretary Mark Paustenbach suggested that the DNC could craft a good “Bernie narrative” about how the Vermont Senator’s campaign was “a mess. ” These leaks are sure to anger supporters of Sanders, who long supported the Senator’s allegations that the DNC establishment was biased against him. It is likely to deepen disappointment among Sanders supporters at the candidate’s recent endorsement of Hillary Clinton. You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook.
