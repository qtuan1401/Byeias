’  ’ ’   Apple announced on Thursday that it will fix certain issues with   iPhone 6 Plus phones for $149, a significant discount from the   $329 service charge the company had been offering users   previously.   ’ ’   The company wrote in :  ’ ’   Although Apple never uses the phrase, this is a fix for ”.” ’ ’’ ’   The problem occurs when certain iPhone models  —   the iPhone 6   Plus, in particular  —   have an issue with an internal part and the   display flickers, displays a grey bar at the top, and becomes   unresponsive to touch. ’ ’   The issue was fairly widespread, according to our readers, who   emailed us frequently after we covered the issue in October. Most   people were frustrated that Apple, although it appeared to be   aware of the issue, would still charge    customers   $329 for a fix.  ’ ’   Apple says it will reimburse customers the difference if they   already paid the $329 to get thier iPhone 6 Plus fixed.   Frustratingly, Apple is still claiming the issue is caused not by   an engineering defect, but rather because the phones were   ”dropped multiple times on a hard surface.”   ’ ’   You can get your iPhone 6 Plus fixed at Apple retail stores and   authorized service providers.  ’ ’.  ’
