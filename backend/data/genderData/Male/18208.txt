FARMERVILLE, Louisiana  —   An illegal immigrant suspected of raping   girls is currently being searched for by Louisiana law enforcement after he was released by federal immigration officials. [Illegal immigrants from Mexico, Christian Ramirez and Mario Rameriz, were both arrested and charged with aggravated rape of   girls in the northern Louisiana town of Farmerville in 2013, according to KNOE News.  At the time, Mario Rameriz was prosecuted and convicted on the rape charges, as he is now serving a   sentence. Union Parish Sheriff Dusty Gates told KNOE Rameriz was prosecuted quickly “due to the seriousness of the charges. ” Christian Ramirez was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while awaiting trial for the rape charges in 2014. That is when ICE mistakenly released Ramirez. “Normally for an individual to be deported he must have no criminal charges,” Gates told KNOE. “This subject was turned over to them, but during the process, and a miscommunication between the prosecutor and the ICE in Alexandria, he was subsequently release. ” Gates said his Sheriff’s Office is working to find the illegal immigrant, saying he has been entered into a national crime database, but admits that he could have already fled back to Mexico. “His whereabouts are unknown” Gates told KNOE. “There’s a possibility he did flee back to Mexico. ” Gates said the poultry industry in Union Parish is what attracts illegal immigrants to the northern Louisiana region.
