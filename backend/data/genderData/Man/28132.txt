The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed it is launching an investigation into the hacking of Ghostbusters (2016) actress Leslie Jones, which led to a leak of sexually explicit photos as well as personal information. [In a statement, the department said that it had launched an “open investigation” into the hacking, but added that “as a matter of agency policy and in order to protect the integrity of an ongoing investigation, [they] will not disclose any details. ”  The investigation comes just a day after the release of the photos and the hacking of Jones’ personal site, which was taken down shortly after the images were published. Jones is known to Breitbart readers after her complaints of harassment led to Milo Yiannopoulos being permanently banned from Twitter. However, Yiannopoulos said in a statement yesterday  he was “wishing her all the best during what must be a very traumatic experience. ” A revenge porn lawyer later suggested that the hack might have been carried out by one of Yiannopoulos’ fans, adding that “had Twitter not banned Milo Yiannopoulos, I bet it wouldn’t have happened. ” Jones is still yet to comment on the incident.
