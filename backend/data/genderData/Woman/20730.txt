Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said the Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives in this years election in November is “definitely within reach. ”  Pelosi said, “I believe that we would if the election were today we would have a good chance to do so. What I’ve said it depends on how big Hillary Clinton’s margin is. The  concern I have is big dark donor money coming in, fossil fuel money, Wall Street money, special interest money, dark coming in a big way. We’re very proud of our chairman. We have great candidates. We have great message. We’re mobilizing on the ground to own the ground. It will be a single digit difference. Maybe they will be a little ahead by some or we’ll be a little ahead by some but it is definitely within reach. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
