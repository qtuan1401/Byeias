Kevin Liptak and Antoine Sanfuentes write at CNN Money:  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is expected to announce this week that Alexander Hamilton’s face will remain on the front of the $10 bill and a woman will replace Andrew Jackson on the face of the $20 bill, a senior government source told CNN on Saturday. Lew announced last summer that he was considering redesigning the $10 bill to include the portrait of a woman. The decision to make the historic change at the expense of Hamilton drew angry rebukes from fans of the former Treasury Secretary. The   movement gained steam after the smash success of the   Broadway musical about his life this year. Those pressures led Lew to determine that Hamilton should remain on the front of the bill. Instead, a   depiction of the women’s suffrage movement  —   including images of leaders such as Susan B. Anthony  —   will be featured on the back of the bill. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on the pending changes. But Lew hinted that a decision could come this week. “When we started this conversation not quite a year ago, it wasn’t clear to me that millions of Americans were going to weigh in with their ideas,” he told CNBC. “We’re not just talking about one bill. We’re talking about the $5, the $10, and the $20. We’re not just talking about one picture on one bill. We’re talking about using the front and the back of the bill to tell an exciting set of stories. ” You can read the rest of the story here.
