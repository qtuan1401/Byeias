Federal authorities in New York have issued a subpoena for records pertaining to allegations that Anthony D. Weiner exchanged sexually explicit messages with a    girl, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Weiner was the subject of an article on Wednesday in The Daily Mail, a British newspaper, that said he had an online correspondence with the girl beginning in January that included suggestive texts and explicit messages sent over social media. According to The Daily Mail, the girl, who was not identified, said she did not want to press charges “because she believes her relationship with Weiner was consensual. ” Still, she and her father agreed to be interviewed out of concern for other underage girls, the publication reported. It was not clear which records investigators in the office of the United States attorney, Preet Bharara, would subpoena. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A spokesman for the New York Police Department said it was investigating Mr. Weiner but did not elaborate. Last month, Mr. Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, told him she wanted to separate, after The New York Post reported that he had exchanged lewd messages with a woman, including a photo that included an image of his crotch as he lay next to the couple’s    son. The New York City Administration for Children’s Services opened an investigation into his treatment of the    Jordan, Mr. Weiner said at the time. Before that, Mr. Weiner’s political career, as a congressman and then a candidate for mayor of New York, had been twice destroyed as a result of lewd messages exchanged with strangers.
