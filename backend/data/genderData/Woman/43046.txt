 (CNN) Police say their investigation started soon after a Las Vegas doctor’s wife grew suspicious and searched through his phone and electronics. Now Dr. Binh Minh Chung’s license has been suspended and the family practice doctor is behind bars, facing sexual assault and child pornography charges. In a   criminal complaint, he’s accused of drugging patients in order to sexually assault them. The complaint lists at least 11 alleged victims, including a minor. On Wednesday, a judge set bail at $1 million after prosecutors argued Chung was a danger to the community. Chung’s attorney, Chris Oram, declined to comment on the case to CNN. In court, he asked for the judge to set bail at $100, 000 and place the doctor on house arrest. A police arrest report says Chung’s wife came forward and showed investigators numerous videos she told them she’d found on a hard drive that belonged to her husband. The videos appeared to show a man in medical scrubs having sex with unconscious women. Chung’s wife, police said, identified the man in the videos as her husband. The police report also details the account of one of the alleged victims, a teen who scheduled a series of appointments with Chung to get treatment for acne. The girl told police Chung picked her up from her home for her third appointment around 10 p. m. one night, then gave her a shot at his office that caused her to lose consciousness. She told police she awakened with her pants off and her feet in stirrups. ”She explained how she was ultimately revived by Chung, who told her she had a bad reaction to the acne treatment,” the arrest report says. From Chung’s office, police said they recovered a hard drive that contained multiple child pornography videos. A preliminary hearing in the case is set for October.
