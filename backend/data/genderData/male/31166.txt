CNN chief national correspondent John King predicted that if President Barack Obama can’t get his Supreme Court nominee through the Senate, he’ll argue “that Republicans blocked him because he’s the first   president, and they didn’t give it to him because of his race” on Tuesday’s broadcast of “AC360. ”  King said, “[T]he president will take this in two phases. Number one, is he will fight for his pick. He’ll fight for his pick because he thinks he deserves to make the pick, and he’ll fight for his pick because, he knows, if he get to appoints the replacement for Antonin Scalia, not only a larger than life figure on the court, and an intellectual powerhouse for the conservatives, but it would tip the court from a conservative 5   majority, to a progressive, or liberal   majority. And if a Democrat then wins the White House in November, this could be the Obama court for a generation. So he understands legacy value in this pick, so he will fight for it. If he doesn’t get it, then he will go around the country trying to turn out votes, trying to turn out the Obama coalition in November to help the Democrats win the White House to make sure at least a Democrat gets that pick next. ” King continued, “And if he does that, he will make the case, and you can bet on it, that Republicans blocked him because he’s the first   president, and they didn’t give it to him because of his race. That will be part of the president’s argument in November. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
