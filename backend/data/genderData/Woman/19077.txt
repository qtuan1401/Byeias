Comedian Jeff Foxworthy helped out a    in a Georgia grocery store on Saturday when he purchased her items for her. [The    comedian  —   best known for his “You might be a redneck if  …    ” routine  —   was reportedly standing in line behind a woman at a Publix grocery store in Georgia when he noticed she was fumbling with coupons while trying to handle three restless children.  “I was at the register and between me worrying about my items and the kids fussing, I didn’t even know that Jeff Foxworthy was standing behind me,” Robin McFadden told local Fox affiliate Fox 5 Atlanta. McFadden told the outlet that Foxworthy walked around her, laughed and put his own credit card in the machine to pay her grocery bill, which came out to $25. “He was such a great guy and I was so happy and lucky to have met him,” she told Fox 5. McFadden took a picture with the comedian and posted it to her Facebook page over the weekend. Foxworthy is the second celebrity to pay for a stranger’s groceries this holiday season. In November, actor Jon Voight purchased six Thanksgiving turkeys for a stranger at a Walmart in Kentucky. The woman was buying the turkeys for dozens of   children at the local Home of the Innocents.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
