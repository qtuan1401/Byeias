White House reporters for the New York Times, NBC, CBS, and CNN pressed Earnest about the details of the Wall Street Journal report, appearing skeptical of the administration’s argument. While the State Department suggested that the date was a “coincidence,” Earnest appeared reluctant to go on the record saying the same thing.
