Police are looking for the passengers of an SUV involved in a   shooting in Kansas City, MO last week, says a Daily Mail report.  In the video, a black SUV pulls up next to a black sedan at a traffic light and opens fire in broad daylight. Per KSHB, the black sedan was hit, but the mother and with her two sons, five and nine, were unharmed. “[One son] told me “Mommy we’re going to die! Mommy move!’ and I couldn’t move because we had a car ahead of us,” the unidentified mother recalled to KSHB. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
