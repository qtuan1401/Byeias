’  ’ ’   Rumors are flying that Twitter is up for sale with a formal bid   on the horizon, according to .  ’ ’   Among the potential suitors are Google and Salesforce  —   an   interesting   of companies to early investor and Spark   Capital partner .  ’ ’   Hyatt, who has no inside information about the company, offered   up another name that should be in the running if the company was   truly up for sale: Disney.  ’ ”   For starters, there’s an obvious connection. Twitter CEO Jack   Dorsey is on the board of Disney so there’s a friendly   relationship there.  ” ’   But the bigger picture is that Twitter is building a   media company, not just another social network and especially not   a sales tool, Hyatt argues.  ’ ’’ ’   This fall, the company began its push in earnest by     NFL Thursday night football and  so people can follow along if they have   an Apple TV or Xbox. It will also livestream the presidential   debates, . ’ ’   ”Twitter is and has always been a media company, and everyone who   thought of them as a messenger company got it wrong,” Hyatt told   Business Insider in an interview. ”And if anyone thinks   they’’re a sales tool and should therefore meld in perfectly to   Salesforce, I don’’t think has spent that much time with the core   teams of either of those two companies.” ’ ”   Disney isn’t just themes park business, but a conglomerate of   media entities including ABC and ESPN. If Twitter starts to   challenge both those properties earnestly, Disney could   potentially scoop it up to help them become interconnected rather   than competitors. To be clear, Hyatt has no inside knowledge and   there’s been no reported interest during this latest round of   rumors. But it doesn’t mean Disney couldn’t be an interested   party in Twitter down the line. ” ’   ”If they’’re not going to be an independent company, then you have   to look at large media companies that are good stewards,” Hyatt   said. ”And I think Disney is the perfect place.” ’
