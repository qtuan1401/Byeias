Thursday on MSNBC’s Democratic presidential primary debate, candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) declared the business model of Wall Street to be “fraud. ”  Sanders said, “Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. That’s fact. I want to say something and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people. In my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. It’s fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached   dollar settlements with the United States government, when we have a weak regulatory system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don’t start breaking them up, we’ll have to bail them out again. I do not want to see that happen. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
