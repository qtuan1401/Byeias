Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos begins the next leg of The Dangerous Faggot tour tonight at Texas Tech in Lubbock, TX. [Many readers will remember highlights from Milo’s previous college visits such as his hero’s welcome at Santa Barbara or the protesters at UCLA. It’s set to be just as eventful this year as Clemson students are already planning protests two months in advance.   Milo’s tour is already gaining publicity as his tour rider, which included 50 white doves released upon his entrance, two dozen McRibs and a vegan to watch him eat every meal, made headlines across the country last month.  For those who want to follow the tour, videos from events will be posted on Milo’s official YouTube page, you can follow Milo’s personal Instagram account for photos of his fabulous hair and extravagant lifestyle, and see Milo’s commentary and chat to other fans on his Facebook page here. Those wishing to attend Milo’s talks in person can visit the Dangerous Faggot website, where all events will be listed in advance. Some campuses are still being confirmed so new dates are added all the time.  For all Milo related news, check out Breitbart’s official Milo category.
