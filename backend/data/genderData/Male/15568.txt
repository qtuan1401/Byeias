On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” while commenting on questions about whether Clinton Foundation donors got preferential treatment from Hillary Clinton’s State Department, Sen. Claire McCaskill ( ) struggled to defend Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over the pay for play allegations.  When asked about the appointment of Rajiv Fernando, a Clinton Foundation donor, to an international intelligence advisory board, McCaskill said, “I’m not sure that was a good idea. On the other hand I think everyone glosses over the fact that this Foundation was doing charitable work around the world. I mean how much time has been given to really talk about the Clinton Foundation. This was not money going into the Clinton’s family pockets. This was money going to fight malaria and AIDS. ” Host Chis Wallace asked, “Senator, you certainly can’t argue that justifies putting a big donor on an official advisory board who had no experience in that area, and that fact that he was on the board was revealed, he quit within 24 hours. ” McCaskill said,“I don’t know why he quit. I don’t know why he was appointed. I do know this. No one has been investigated more than Hillary Clinton in the history of presidential politics. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
