’  ’ ’   2016 Emmy Awards host Jimmy Kimmel kicked off the show Sunday by    with some of the biggest names in television   from this year. ’ ’   But the surprise of the opening was when the   host ran   into Jeb Bush. ’ ’   Though Bush’’s run for the Republican presidential nomination   didn’’t turn out the way he planned, he is on the road to a   rebound thanks to playing a limo driver for ”Veep” president   Selina Meyer in the Kimmel bit. ’ ’   ”I’’m between jobs,” Bush told Kimmel. ’ ’   He was apparently driving an Uber in the sketch. ’ ’  ’ ’   When Bush learns that Kimmel is nominated tonight (outstanding   variety talk series) Bush tells him, “If you run a positive   campaign, the voters will ultimately make the right choice. ” ’ ’   Kimmel seemed to appreciate the note until Bush said, “Jimmy,   that was a joke,” and threw him out of the limo. ’ ’   Some impressive comedic timing for Bush. See the complete bit   with Bush below. ’ ’ ’ ’Video:  open with skit with  trying to get a limo Uber ride from   ’
