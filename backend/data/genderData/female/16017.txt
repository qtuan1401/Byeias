Dinesh D’Souza joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon Tuesday morning to discuss his #1 New York Times bestselling book, Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, as well as the new documentary of the same name. [D’Souza said:  It’s unbelievable. If you look at CNN, or the networks, or NPR, you wouldn’t know that my movie or your movie [Clinton Cash] exists. They’re pretending it doesn’t. They’re hoping it goes away. Now, in some ways that doesn’t totally surprise me. But what does surprise me is that I haven’t heard a whisper from the RNC. Now, if I were Michael Moore, the whole Democratic Party would have moved behind me to push this movie to get it out to independent voters, to have it seen by Latinos and blacks and so on. So what those guys are doing   …     we’re doing a kind of messaging using the media of film that the RNC doesn’t even begin to know how to do. It’s a completely different medium. We’ve done the messaging you’d think they’d take advantage of it. Listen to the complete interview below. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
