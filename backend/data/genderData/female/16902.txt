On the Saturday broadcast of “Justice” on Fox News Channel, host Judge Jeanine Pirro reacted to Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney saying the Muslim man who attempted to kill a Philadelphia police officer in the name of Islamic State does not represent the teachings of Islam.  Pirro ripped the Philadelphia mayor in a long rant for pandering to the White House and not referring to the attempted murderer as an Islamic terrorist, despite the man claiming to have acted in the name of ISIS, his mother saying he is a “devout Muslim” or even the Muslim garb he wore during the attack. “Hey, Mayor Kenney, in case you forgot, Philadelphia is the place where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was written. Its location is a symbol of freedom where Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell sit. Last I checked, the first Amendment reigns supreme. Who are you to tell me what the shooter’s motivations are?” “How dare you take the sympathy away from the victim, Officer Hartnett, and the men and women in blue under siege in this country by the haters and turn it into sympathy and understanding for a different group?” she asked. “I don’t need you tell me how to think because you want to suck up to the Commander in Chief. How about you drop your liberal, ideological nonsense and stop apologizing and start focusing on those who are out to kill those in your department. I don’t know if you need to see an eye doctor, but the man is wearing Muslim garb, he has sworn allegiance to ISIS, he told the cops he did it for Allah and ISIS. His own mother says he’s a devout Muslim. Are you stupid? “So Mr. Mayor, stop mouthing off when you don’t know the facts because you’re pandering either to the White House and the political class that’s taking us down this road. Why don’t you start by offering your sympathies to Officer Hartnett, his family and the families of those Americans killed in California?” she scolded. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
