A man wielding a footlong kitchen knife was shot by a police officer in the Bronx this week after the man refused to drop the weapon and could not be subdued with pepper spray, the authorities said. The man, Shamel Jones, 19, was taken into custody after the shooting on Wednesday and rushed to Lincoln Hospital, where he remained in critical condition on Thursday, the police said. He was expected to recover. Officers from the 41st Precinct responded to an emergency call for a “” police jargon for an assault, at Tiffany Street and Westchester Avenue in the Foxhurst neighborhood, said Assistant Chief Larry Nikunen, the commanding officer of the Bronx patrol borough. A woman, who had visible bruises around the eyes and on the forehead, flagged down the officers when they arrived and told them her boyfriend had beaten her, Chief Nikunen said. On a canvass with the officers, the woman pointed out the suspect a few blocks away. He fled into an apartment building on Intervale Avenue when they tried to approach him, Chief Nikunen said. The officers, three patrolmen and a lieutenant, pursued the man to the third floor, where they were let inside the apartment by another man, Chief Nikunen said. They found the suspect in the kitchen holding a knife and ordered him to drop it. When he refused, Chief Nikunen said, a lieutenant used pepper spray on him. But the suspect was not affected, the police said, and he moved toward the officers, prompting one of them to fire a single shot from his service weapon. The bullet struck the suspect on the left side of his lower back, Chief Nikunen said. After the shooting, the police released a photo of the knife and said it had a   blade. Chief Nikunen said the police received a second 911 call from someone inside the apartment who backed the officers’ account of what happened. He said he did not know if that person witnessed the shooting.
