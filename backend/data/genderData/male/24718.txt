Emails reveal that U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) pushed local law enforcement to scan the license plates of gun show attendees in southern California. [The emails date back to 2010 and were obtained by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).  According to WSJ, “[ICE] crafted a plan in 2010 to use   readers —  devices that record the plate numbers of all passing cars —  at gun shows in Southern California, including one in Del Mar. ” ICE then “compared that information to cars that crossed the border, hoping to find gun smugglers, according to the documents and interviews with   officials with knowledge of the operation. ” ICE faced   over the scans from privacy advocates. ACLU attorney Jay Stanley pointed to license plate readers as an example that “highlights the problem with mass collection of data. ” Stanley suggested ICE has taken two legal behaviors —  buying a gun, crossing a border —  combined them and used that combination to make people look “inherently suspicious. ” Gun Owners of America’s Erich Pratt went further, saying, “Information on   gun owners ends up getting recorded, stored, and registered, which is a violation of the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act and of the Second Amendment. ” ICE defended their actions as “an important and legal tool for pursuing dangerous,    illegal activity. ” At the same time, no arrests have been cited as resulting from the use of license plate readers on gun show attendees. However, John Chicgos —  CEO of the company that makes the license plate readers —  believes using them to target gun show attendees is “an abuse of the technology. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
