Whitehurst played in spells   for the Indianapolis Colts last year, the Tennessee Titans the   year before that, and the San Diego Chargers in 2013. This is his   fourth team in four years. ’ ”   Whitehurst spoke to media on Thursday to talk about preparing in   his first week with the NFL’s most depleted team. And even   Whitehurst, who’s been around the NFL, did not see many familiar   faces. ” ’ ’ ’  QB Charlie Whitehurst: ”I’’ve never met anybody in this locker room”’t’t’ ”   Though Whitehurst may see some snaps this week or in the future   if Kessler struggles, in the end, he seems aware that he’s   another   for the most   team in the   league. ” ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tQB Charlie Whitehurst said he’’s aware of  QB history ”yeah, man. Been a lot of quarterbacks. ”’t’t’ ’   Despite never being able to stick with a team over an extended   period of time, Whitehurst will potentially get to throw more   passes in the NFL. ’ ”   This time around, he’ll just need a little more time to learn his   receivers’ names. ”
