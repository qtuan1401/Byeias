 (CNN) The three   members of 1990s RB group Destiny’s Child reunited onstage Saturday night in a surprise performance. Beyonce, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams appeared onstage at the Stellar Gospel Music Awards in Las Vegas for a rendition of ”Say Yes,” according to Billboard. The awards will air April 5 on TV One. ”Say Yes” is a song off Williams’ fourth gospel album, ”Journey to Freedom.” Williams, who was up for several awards, kicked off the performance solo. Then, Rowland and Beyonce emerged from the shadows, cheers growing as it became clear that a reunion was in progress. It was the first time they were together onstage since the 2013 Super Bowl. There was some speculation ahead of time that they might perform together thanks to Williams, who included Beyonce and Rowland in a tweet about the ceremony. Several in the crowd had their phones and video cameras in hand to capture the moment.
