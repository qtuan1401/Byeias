Per a Fox 2 report, a Muslim woman says she was fired from her new job because she refused to remove her hijab.  Najaf Khan entered her third day on the job Monday wearing her hijab for the first time at Fair Oaks Dental Care in Fairfax, VA, she says. Her boss then called her into his office and told her she could not wear the hijab. Khan is studying to be a dentist at George Mason University. Monday was the first day Khan wore her headscarf on the job, which is when she says her boss told her they wanted to keep a “neutral environment. ” She was asked to remove the hijab because her employer said it would offend patients and they wanted to keep religion out of the office. Khan said she was “astonished” to learn she had to lose the headscarf or lose her job. “I was astonished because he had been saying I had been doing so well,” she said. “I received an email Friday morning saying how much positive enthusiasm I was bringing into the dental office. So me going in with my head scarf, I didn’t think it was going to be a big issue. I was completely aware that he might ask me, but I didn’t know it would come down to the fact that if I wear it, I can’t work there. ” Fox 2 reportedly reached out to Fair Oaks Dental Care for comment, but have yet to receive one.
