[Maria L. was found raped and murdered in Freiberg in  . Following seven weeks of investigation, a    migrant, who arrived during the migrant crisis, was arrested on Friday, reports Focus.  “Through interviews and a   survey, we were able to reconstruct [Maria’s] final hours,” said David Müller, head of the police’s Special Commission, during a press conference on Saturday. “The    student had been at a party. By 2. 37am, she left the party. Maria L. then cycled home, as usual. ” “The young woman had been the victim of a sexual offence and a violent crime. ” According to the chief investigator, Maria was drowned after being raped. Her body was found in the River Dreisam on the 16th of October. A thorough investigation of the area around the river was undertaken. A striking, long, dark, strand of hair, partially dyed blond, was found in a blackberry bush. A black scarf belonging to the victim was also found in the riverbed. DNA from the victim linked DNA from the scarf and to that of the long strand of hair. The perpetrator’s DNA did not match any records from the national database, so investigators combed through CCTV footage for three weeks. On the 30th of November, video footage was found of the migrant, who had a “very conspicuous hairstyle, an undercut hairstyle” with a portion of his long hair dyed blonde  —   matching the dye pattern of the hair found at the scene. On the 2nd of December, the asylum seeker was arrested, and DNA from the Afghan was confirmed to match that of the evidence held by forensic investigators. He is currently being held in custody. It has not been ascertained whether the    Afghan migrant is also a suspect in the murder of Carolin G. who was raped and murdered at the beginning of November while jogging in Endingen.
