And they’ll be available starting at $299.” ’“These new head mounted displays will be the first consumer offerings utilizing the Mixed Reality capabilities of Windows 10 Creators Update,” says a Microsoft spokesperson.’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’While the software is the same, the hardware could make a big difference, in the same way that a $1, 500 Surface Book laptop is a better experience than a $200   Windows PC.’ ’’ ’’ ’’
