Director of Government Affairs for the American Family Association (AFA) Sandy Rios, joined Breitbart News Saturday host Matt Boyle to discuss the problem with Target’s recent decision regarding its store’s public restrooms. [Rios said, “The Target department store chain has jumped into the transgender bathroom debate by declaring that men who claim to be women may use whatever bathroom or changing room they choose. ”  According to Rios: The problem with Target’s policy is that they are now opening their bathrooms, really welcoming and inviting people of all sexual persuasions to go into bathrooms, and I have in my hand probably a dozen articles of cases where men who were dressed as women abused or raped or molested women or children in bathrooms. She went on to say that within 24 hours, the American Family Association heard “from close to 250, 000 people already” in support of an effort to boycott Target: The American Family Association is calling for a boycott of Target after the retail giant said it would allow men to use the women’s restrooms and dressing rooms in their stores. On its website this week, Target announced, “[W]e welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.   …     Everyone deserves to feel like they belong. ” This means a man can simply say he “feels like a woman today” and enter the women’s restroom   …     even if young girls or women are already in there. Rios continued by discussing AFA’s proposed solution of adding a “gender neutral bathroom. ” However, she does not believe that would be enough to satisfy the Left.
