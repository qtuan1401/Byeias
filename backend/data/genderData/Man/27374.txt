On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Wolf,” Chuck Hagel, who served as Defense Secretary under President Obama and as a Republican Senator from Nebraska stated that he doesn’t believed claims from the US government about how many ISIS fighters have been killed.  Hagel responded to a question about whether he believed numbers from US officials about the number of ISIS fighters who have been killed with, “No, I don’t, because first of all, what’s the veracity, the credibility you collect those numbers? That’s to start with. I don’t think the public believes it. My policy has always been, don’t release that kind of thing. ” He added that body counts “make no sense. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
