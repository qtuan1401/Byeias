 (The Hollywood Reporter) Say hello to my little friend    again. Universal is moving forward with its ”Scarface” remake and has tapped ”Straight Outta Compton” writer Jonathan Herman to do the rewrite. ’Scarface’ Star: Martin Scorsese Warned Me Hollywood Would Hate It, Paul Attanasio and David Ayer wrote previous drafts of the film, which will be a new and original take on the immigrant story, which spawned films in 1932 and 1983.  The 1983 version, which was released by Universal, tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises up to become a powerful drug kingpin. That film made the expression ”Say hello to my little friend” one of the most iconic lines in cinema. The new film will be set in Los Angeles and explore an immigrant’s rise in the criminal underworld. Herman has become a   writer at Universal, having penned the ”Straight Outta Compton” draft that received the green light from the studio. He is currently in development on ”The Demonologist” and ”The Birds” remake at Universal. The Uncensored Story Behind ’Mad Men’ Pablo Larraín will direct ”Scarface,” which is being produced by Marc Shmuger via his Global Produce banner. Scott Stuber and Dylan Clark also are producing for Bluegrass Films. Marty Bregman, producer of the 1983 version, is also on board to produce. Jon Mone and Jay Polidoro will oversee the project for Universal. Herman is repped by WME, Stephen Crawford at Industry Entertainment, and Lichter, Grossman, Nicols, Adler  Feldman.
