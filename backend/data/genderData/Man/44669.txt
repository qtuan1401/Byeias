’Infiniti has always been the odd one out in the luxury car segment. The automaker is an offshoot of Nissan, and like its Lexus and Acura counterparts  —   which are offshoots of Toyota and Honda, respectively  —   it has never quite been viewed as a genuine luxury marque.’ ”It shares parts and architecture across Nissan’s global product ecosystem and, historically, Infiniti has offered precious little to distinguish itself from the everyday   Nissans roaming the streets around the globe.” ”And then there’s Infiniti’s branding. For more than 20 years, the company struggled to figure out how to market itself. Its current models are luxurious, but   is evident in some of the cars’ materials. They are stylish, but, until recently, the design language has gone through several iterations and nothing seemed to stick.” ”Infiniti has sought to fix these things. The company   —   part of a bid to differentiate itself and stop being one of the luxury car market’s  . It brought on   exec Johan de Nysschen as its president in 2012, and de Nysschen sought to make Infiniti the Japanese equivalent of BMW.” ’The effort was more or less unsuccessful, and  for Cadillac two years after he started.’
