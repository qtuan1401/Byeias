(REUTERS) Americans who had cast their votes for the next president early on Tuesday appeared to be worried about the direction of the country, and were looking for a “strong leader who can take the country back from the rich and powerful,” according to an early reading from the   national Election Day poll. [The poll of more than 10, 000 people who have already cast their ballots in the presidential election showed a majority of voters are worried about their ability to get ahead and have little confidence in political parties or the media to improve their situation. A majority also feel that the economy is rigged to mostly help the wealthy.  The poll, which will be updated as additional responses are tallied and votes are counted throughout Tuesday, found:  —   75 percent agree that “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful. ”  —   72 percent agree “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful. ”  —   68 percent agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me. ”  —   76 percent believe “the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth. ” Read the rest of the story at Reuters. com.
