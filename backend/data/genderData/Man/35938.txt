 (CNN) Alexander Lukashenko    often called ”the last dictator in Europe”    certainly has   citizens. Belarusians are now stripping off in their offices after the president ordered them to ”get undressed and work.” Using the hashtag #раздеватьсяиработать    roughly translating to #GetUndressedAndGoToWork    people all over the country are sharing nudies on social media.  The president’s exclamation seems to have been a Freudian slip, as the phrase ”get undressed” (razden’sya) sounds similar to ”develop themselves” (razvivat’ sebya) in Russian. Lukashenko expressed his wish during a speech at the 5th Belarusian People’s Congress in Minsk. All in all, the speech addressed the importance of technology and innovation in order to lift Belarus from one of its worst economic situations in decades.  The nude flash mob has been picked up outside of Belarus as well, with more and more social media users undressing around the Baltic Sea.
