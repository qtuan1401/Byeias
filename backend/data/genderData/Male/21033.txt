Huffington Post senior editor Chloe Angyal gave her “less joyful” winner of the week Saturday on MSNBC, calling the newly signed law in North Carolina that forces people to use public bathrooms that correspond to their biological sex a “banner week for bigots. ”  “This was a banner week for transphobic bigots,” Angyal stated. “This was a real win this week for people who would pit cisgender women against transgender women in the name of women’s safety, the people who are saying by protecting the safety and dignity of transgender people we are opening the door for sexual violence against other women. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
