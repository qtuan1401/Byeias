A California man was sentenced to life in prison Monday for cutting out his girlfriend’s lung while she was alive, then killing her, according to the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office. [Alexander Anthony Clever, 28, pleaded no contest to a   murder charge and is not eligible for parole, KDVR reported.  He also admitted to committing mayhem and torture during the killing, according to KABC. Clever went to a Motel 6 in Pomona, California, with his girlfriend, Yvette Silva, and two others two years ago, KDVR reported. Clever got into an argument with Silva and went into the bathroom. When the other two companions heard muffled screams, they went into the bathroom to see what was going on and found Clever holding Silva’s unconscious body in a chokehold, according to the DA’s office. The two others tried to free her, then ran for help. By the time police arrived on the scene, Silva’s heart and lung were cut out of her body, the DA’s office said. Deputy DA Michael Matoba, who prosecuted the case, said Silva was still alive when her heart and lung were cut out of her body, according to KDVR. Police arrested Clever outside his home two days later after they found a knife on him that tested positive for Silva’s DNA.
