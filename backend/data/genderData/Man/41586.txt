 (CNN) The wraps are off Russia’s new main battle tank. Copies of the new Armata   medium tank have been rumbling through Moscow this week as the Russian military practices for Saturday’s Victory Day parade commemorating the end of World War II in Europe. News services have distributed several images of the tanks this week. The   was seen in photos last week during parade practice, but those tanks had their turrets covered in canvas. Along with exposing the tanks during the practices, Russia’s Defense Ministry posted images of the Armata and other new armor on its official website under the headline, ”Advanced   military hardware.” More than two dozen photographs of the hardware taken during parade practice were also posted on the military’s site. According to the website RT. com, the Armata ”is a   vehicle with an unmanned turret armed with a brand new 125 mm smoothbore cannon, which is the most powerful gun of its kind to date in terms of muzzle energy.” Russia’s TASS news agency reported last year that the tank’s crew of two will ”operate the gun from an isolated armored capsule.” As well as supporting the main battle tanks, the Armata platform will be used for an infantry combat vehicle, a heavy armored personnel carrier and   artillery, according to TASS. The new tanks are expected to be put into service this year, the news agency reported. Russia also will be showing off new aircraft during the Victory Day celebrations. Flyovers will include 140 planes and helicopters, TASS reported Tuesday, after the aircraft made practice runs over Moscow.
