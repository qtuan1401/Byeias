Sunday NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta said, “Look, if we hold on to Nevada, hold on to Michigan, you know, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president of the United States. ”  He continued, “Most people vote on election day in Michigan and our schedule has been oriented to being in the early vote states in the earlier period of time. Now we’re going to Michigan, to New Hampshire, to Pennsylvania where they do it the   way, everybody votes on election day. We feel like we got a lead in Michigan. We want to hold on to it. We think we can do that. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
