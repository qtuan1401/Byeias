 (CNN) A pioneer for underwater photography from the 1940’s, Bruce Mozert’s work challenged conventions by creating uncanny visuals of the American dream    entirely underwater.  Bruce Mozert was also recognized for his work as a set photographer on iconic film projects such as ”Tarzan” and ”Creature from the Black Lagoon,” but it is his underwater commercial projects for Silver Springs tourism that have stood out as his signature.  This body of work has been compiled by Gary Monroe into a book titled ”Silver Springs: The Underwater Photography of Bruce Mozert.”  CNN Style discusses Mozert’s work with Monroe through the gallery above.
