  actress and lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow confessed in a recent interview that she struggles to help her young children with their homework because she doesn’t understand the curriculum. [According to Entertainment Tonight, during a recent conversation with KIIS FM’s Kyle and Jackie O Show in Australia, the Goop founder described herself as a “calm, pretty patient and normal person,” but admitted she gets frustrated when helping her children with rocker Chris Martin do their school work.  On helping her daughter Apple, 11, and her son Moses, 9, with their studies, Paltrow stated, “Honestly, it’s where the worst part of my personality comes out. ” She added: “When homework time [comes around] I’m such an a —  hole. ” Paltrow, 43, then divulged that she finds the children’s school assignments too difficult to comprehend. “I don’t understand [Moses’] math,” she joked. “There’s so many things going wrong at one point, it’s so frustrating. ” Children around age nine are generally using formal written algorithms, as well as using basic multiplication and learning their times tables. Likewise, children age 11 are generally still learning U. S. state capitals and grasping words and phrases, including figurative language such as metaphors and similes. Paltrow’s lifestyle publication Goop generally publishes articles on topics including vaginal steam cleaning and $200 detox smoothies. The actress previously admitted she was passed over for a contributing editor position at Yahoo because she didn’t meet the educational requirements.
