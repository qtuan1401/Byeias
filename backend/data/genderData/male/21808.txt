Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the U. S. and other Western powers “failed and God willing, they will continue to fail” to rein in the nation’s missile program. [From the Times of Israel:  Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei on Monday said the United States cannot “do a damn thing” about the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program. “They have engaged in a lot of hue and cry over Iran’s missile capabilities, but they should know that this ballyhoo does not have any influence and they cannot do a damn thing,” Khamenei said, according to the   Fars News Agency. Iran in March tested ballistic missiles, including two with the words “Israel must be wiped off the earth” emblazoned on them, according to the US and other Western powers. Under a nuclear deal signed last year between world powers and Iran, ballistic missile tests are not forbidden outright but are “not consistent” with a United Nations Security Council resolution from July 2015, US officials say. According to the UN decision, “Iran is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology,” until October 2023. “The US and other powers are extremely sad at this issue and they have no other option that is why they made huge efforts in order to bring the country’s   and   centers under their control, but they failed and God willing, they will continue to fail,” Khamanei said on Monday.
