During a May 13 appearance on NBC’s Today, Katie Couric previewed her upcoming gun control documentary by claiming a “silent majority” of gun owners want more gun control. [Couric said these things during an interview conducted by Matt Lauer, who began the interview by countering FBI statistics and claiming mass shootings are on the rise. In September 2014, the FBI released a highly politicized study claiming a rise in mass shootings, only to have the authors of the study recant months later and admit they created data to make the study outcome fit a preconceived conclusion.  Yet Lauer claimed mass shootings are on the rise, and Couric played along without hesitation. In fact, she built on Lauer’s mass shootings comment to suggest more gun control is needed, and a “silent majority” of gun owners support it. Couric said: Ninety percent of the public really favors universal background checks. And after Sandy Hook, everyone thought this was a watershed moment, something would be done. And then when   died in the Senate, I couldn’t understand the disconnect between public opinion and our elected officials. So Couric undertook a gun control documentary, “Under the Gun,” and says that in interviewing people for the film, she came to the conclusion that the NRA really does not speak for the majority of gun owners. She said, “The NRA only represents five percent of gun owners, so there’s this huge silent majority, and they represent common ground. ” Couric claims that that “common ground” is support for the same kind of background checks that have been demonstrable failures in California, Colorado, Washington state, and Paris, France.
