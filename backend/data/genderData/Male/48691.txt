’  ’ ’   Apple may have killed the headphone jack in the iPhone 7, but a   new, sleek case is trying to bring it back. ’ ’   ”What people put into their own ear holes is a very personal   choice, and it’’s a choice we should all get the chance to make  —     not one that should be made for us,” Diego Prince, a hardware   developer from Austin, Texas,  announcing the cases, which would be made for   iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. ’ ’   Prince and his cofounder Troy Osinoff just launched an  saying they plan to ship in December   if the campaign reaches its goal. ”Early Bird” backers   can reserve one case for $49 plus shipping. ’ ”   According to the campaign site, the Fuze takes the adapter dongle   that Apple included with the iPhone 7 and builds it directly into   the case, restoring the 3. 5 mm headphone jack. It also has an   extended battery pack and, as most cases should, protects the   phone from damage if it’s dropped. ” ’   The battery pack would provide about extra eight hours of power,   according to Prince. ’ ’’ ’   The idea for the case is already getting plenty of positive   feedback on Product Hunt,  by techies looking for the latest gadgets and   software. ’ ”   Prince is trying to raise $60, 000 in the next month for Fuze,   which he says will be spent on prototyping, testing, and   shipping, with the goal of getting it to backers around   Christmastime. But as with any crowdfunding effort, there are   risks involved  —   namely that Fuze wouldn’t ship by its expected   date, or at all. ” ”   Still, it’s an interesting concept that  may get behind. ” ’   ”We do have an incredibly tight deadline,” Prince told Business   Insider, though he said he is confident that he can deliver the   cases on schedule. ’
