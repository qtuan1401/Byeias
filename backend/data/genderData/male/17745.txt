WikiLeaks’ latest release of emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta have shown campaign donors discussing how it is “obvious” that the U. S is no longer a democracy. [James Sandler, who is on the board of directors of The Sandler Foundation which gives regularly to Democrat Party causes, sent an email to his father Herbert Sandler with a link to an article of a Princeton University study which suggested the U. S was “no longer an actual democracy. ”  “I guess it takes a study to point out the obvious,” James Sandler said in the email. Herbert Sandler, who is the former CEO of Golden West Financial Corporation and set up the Sandler Foundation with his late wife Marion, consequently forwarded the email to John Podesta. He remarked that the notion was “consistent with Piketty,” a reference to the writings of   French economist Thomas Piketty, who wrote the best selling book Capital in the   Century. Podesta replied to the email by referring Sandler to a piece in The New York Times Sunday review about ‘The End of Liberal Zionism,’ an     which he described as “depressing but insightful. ” Herbert Sandler finished off the exchange by saying that he had “read and circulated” the article, adding that “this is precisely what Marion and I have believed for some time and what Peter Benart writes about regularly. It is horrible. ” The stated mission aim of the Sandler Foundation is to “invest in strategic organizations and exceptional leaders that seek to improve the rights, opportunities and   of others, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. ” “As of December 31, 2015, Sandler Foundation had made charitable grants exceeding $750 million, with the majority of the funds distributed since 2006,” the foundation’s website reads.
