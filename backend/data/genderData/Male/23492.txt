The hashtag #TrudeauEulogies is trending on Twitter, mocking Canadian PM Justin Trudeau’s praising of Fidel Castro following the Cuban dictator’s death. [Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke about Castro fondly, saying, “It is with deep sorrow that I learned today of the death of Cuba’s longest serving President. Fidel Castro was a larger than life leader who served his people for almost half a century. A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr. Castro made significant improvements to the education and healthcare of his island nation. ”  Many were upset at Trudeau’s failure to mention that Castro was a dictator who forced gay people into internment camps, killed his political opposition, and was a socialist dictator who’s death has caused Cubans who fled his brutal regime to celebrate. Below are a few tweets in the currently trending hashtag #TrudeauEulogies that satirise Trudeau’s ignoring of the atrocities committed by tyrants like Castro. ”Today we mourn painter and animal rights activist, Adolf Hitler.
