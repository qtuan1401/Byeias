A Florida millionaire accused of abuse has released surveillance video of his   beating herself up. [Scott Mitchell, 45, released the footage of Mary Hunt, 29, as part of a legal battle over allegedly stolen jewelry, the Daily Mail reported.  Mitchell accused Hunt of stealing $2. 1 million worth of jewelry when they broke off their engagement last summer, while Hunt claimed he abused her and set her up. Hunt claimed Mitchell was responsible for giving her a black eye and several bruises, but video footage shows that the bruises were   according to Mitchell’s attorney Todd Foster.  “The explanation for the black eye is now very different,” Foster said to FOX 13: “There is no evidence that he ever beat her,” Foster continued. “This video now demonstrates that she is striking herself in the same area of the face and head that they allege Scott struck her. ” Hunt described the alleged abuse to FOX 13 back in June: “There were so many times when I wanted to give up, but I couldn’t do it anymore and I think about how much he would have wanted this,” she said to the station. Mitchell filed a lawsuit against Hunt and her parents earlier this year for $4 million to cover damages and the missing jewelry, the Daily Mail reported. Police charged Hunt with grand theft back in October.
