Writer Dan Savage stated that he doesn’t want a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the US, he just wants to give them citizenship on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time. ”  Savage asked, “Why do we want to throw these 11 million people out the country? They contribute more to our economy than they take out. They pay more in taxes than they receive in services.   …     Illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes per capita.    —     Americans, not   Amercians, are     times more likely to commit a violent crime,     times more likely to be in prison than illegal immigrants. ” He added that the rationale for building a wall on the border is “bullsh*t. ” And “I don’t want a f*cking path to citizenship. I just want to give them citizenship. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
