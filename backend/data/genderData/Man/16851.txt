Hillary Clinton appeared on Capitol Hill to warn the world about “fake news,” explaining that Americans learned of the “real world consequences” of it in 2016. [“The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year  —   it’s now clear that   fake news can have real world consequences,” Clinton said. “This isn’t about politics or bipartisanship. Lives are at risk. ”  Clinton called for Congress to pass legislation to stop it and for tech moguls in Silicon Valley to continue searching for a way to block it from entering readers’ Facebook and Twitter feeds. “It’s a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly,” Clinton said. Clinton made her comments during a speech honoring Senate Minority Harry Reid’s retirement from the Senate. She delivered a joke after taking the podium, commenting on her   activities. “After a few weeks of taking selfies in the woods, I thought it’d be a good idea to come out,” she said.
