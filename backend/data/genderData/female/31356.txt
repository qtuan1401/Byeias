Spare some sympathy for Anthony Weiner: had he been elected Mayor of New York in 2013, the city would be in better shape than under   Bill de Blasio. [Weiner was undone by a return to the sexting —  and, more particularly, the   —  that destroyed his congressional career. Now, Weiner, a new documentary, tells the story of that second implosion, and how it affected Weiner’s marriage to   Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin.  This is not Weiner’s first turn on the silver screen. He made his debut at the end of Hating Breitbart, the Andrew Marcus documentary about the founder of this website, but appears only in an epilogue, as credits roll. In 2012, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin portrayed “Weinergate” in an episode of HBO’s Newsroom —  one that distorted history to demonize new media and the woman who reluctantly came forward with the damning evidence. (If you want to know the real story, as told by Andrew Breitbart himself and not in Sorkin’s rewrite, you can read it here.) Apparently, Weiner also landed a role in the absurdist horror flick Sharknado 3, and the New York Times —  which has seen an early exclusive preview of the film —  says that Weiner retains a sense of humor about his downfall. Yet it remains a dark story about internal demons, continued lies, and his wife’s quixotic efforts to save public face. Breitbart News first flagged the possibility of a Weiner documentary in 2013, when the New York Post reported that he was traveling with a filmmaker. That filmmaker turns out to have been “Josh Kriegman, who served as the chief of staff for Mr. Weiner’s district office from ” according to the New York Times.  Yet from the Times‘ account, the film pulls no punches —  and raises new questions about the entourage the Clintons intend to bring to the White House.
