’  ’ ’   Something fishy is going on. ’ ”   Eben   and Scott Soshnick at  have pointed out that star Under Armour athlete   Michael Phelps isn’t wearing Under Armour on the cover   of Sports Illustrated. ” ”   He’s wearing Nike. ” ’   ”T ’ ”   An Under Armour representative and Phelps’ agent told Bloomberg   the athlete was required to wear Nike because it was Team USA’s   sponsor for the Olympics. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”It is always challenging analyzing, interpreting, and managing   the myriad rules and regs with which the athletes are told they   must comply, with their eligibility at stake,” Peter Carlisle,   Phelps’’ agent, told Bloomberg. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’     ’ ’  ’ ’   In the past, Phelps has done his duty as an Under Armour   spokesman, going so far as to say that he had never even worn   Nike. ’ ’   ”For me, growing up in Baltimore, Under Armour is the   sports line. It’’s what I grew up with my whole life,” he told    in March. ”I don’’t know another brand. To be honest, I   have never worn a pair of Nikes in my entire life. I couldn’’t   even wear Nikes when I was with Speedo, before Under Armour. I’’ve   literally never tried on a pair of Nike shoes.” ’ ’   But there’’s something quite revealing in that Adweek story, as   writer Tim Nudd wrote that he ”backtracks on this a little, and   admits to having worn them on the podium when Nike was a team   sponsor. But he insists he’’s never done so recreationally.” ’
