Ahead of the South Carolina presidential primary, Marco Rubio pointed out that former Florida governor Jeb Bush lacks foreign policy experience. [“The fact of the matter is Jeb has no foreign policy experience. None,” Rubio said. “He just has no foreign policy experience and he was governor a long time ago. ”  Bush left office in 2007, before serving on corporate boards and financial companies while earning millions in speaking fees. “The world has changed a lot in the last ten years, and foreign policy has changed a lot in the last five years,” Rubio said, referring to Bush’s last time in public office. Rubio is making the case that he is the most experienced candidate on stage in the arena of foreign policy because of the intelligence briefings he receives as a member of the Senate foreign relations committee. “No one on that stage has more experience or has shown better judgment or a better understanding of the national security threats before this country than I have,” he said. Rubio traveled to Washington, D. C. yesterday to vote for a North Korean sanctions bill before returning to South Carolina to campaign. During a South Carolina campaign event, Bush was questioned about North Korean sanctions by a voter, but he was unclear about the details. “I don’t know the specifics of the sanctions, but I think we need to   sanctions to put pressure on the North Koreans so they know the consequence of this aggressive action will cost more than the benefits they think they have,” Bush said.
