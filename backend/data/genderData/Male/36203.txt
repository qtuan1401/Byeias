 (CNN) A Navy investigation has concluded that Chris Kyle, the famed Navy SEAL sniper, received fewer medals than his records had previously shown. Kyle, who wrote the   memoir ”American Sniper” that was later made into a movie starring Bradley Cooper, received only one Silver Star and four Bronze medals, the Navy said in announcing its findings.   In his book, Kyle had written that he received two Silver Stars and five Bronze medals during his service. The Navy has corrected his medal count following the investigation. ”After thoroughly reviewing all available records, the Navy determined an error was made in the issuance of Chief Petty Officer Chris Kyle’s form DD214,” which is the standard report filed upon separation from military service, Navy spokeswoman Lt. Jackie Pau told CNN.    ”Specifically, the DD214 did not accurately reflect the decorations and awards to which Kyle was officially entitled. After notifying his family of the error, the Navy issued a corrected copy of the DD214, which accurately reflects Kyle’s years of honorable and extraordinary service.” Errors on the DD214 form are very common. The Silver Star is the military’s third highest military decoration for valor, while the Bronze Star is awarded to members of the US military for heroic or meritorious service or achievement in a combat zone. The difficulty surrounding the discrepancies are compounded by the fact that some of the records in Kyle’s file, who was discharged in 2009, were compiled from   based systems earlier in his career, the Navy said when it launched the investigation in May. The discrepancy was first reported by The Intercept at that time.  Kyle would have played no role in the production of his personnel files other than signing the   upon his discharge, the Navy said at the time. Kyle was murdered by fellow Marine veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a Texas shooting range in 2013.
