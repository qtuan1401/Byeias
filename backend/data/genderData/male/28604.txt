Hillary Clinton’s close aide Huma Abedin revealed in a statement to reporters that she would separate from her husband Anthony Wiener after the former New York Congressman embarrassed her again with lewd online behavior with other women. [“After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,” she said in a statement. “Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy. ”  The decision comes after new lewd photos of Weiner were leaked to the New York Post, one of which included his son. In the past, Abedin repeatedly cited therapy, her Muslim faith, and personal forgiveness to try to put the scandal behind her, but Weiner repeatedly embarrassed her with revelations of his behavior splashed on the front pages of New York tabloids. Abedin has been traveling the country with Clinton assisting her with her presidential campaign. On Monday morning, Weiner deleted his Twitter account, but has not responded to Abedin’s announcement.
