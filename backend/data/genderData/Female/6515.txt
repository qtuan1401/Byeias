On the emotional fulcrum of New York City   size and setting are forever in sway. Does a park view trump a guest bedroom? Is a vast kitchen worth settling blocks from a trendy thoroughfare? Usually, a compromise is struck. Unless it isn’t. For a small but resolute faction of New Yorkers, living in a particular neighborhood, or even on a certain street, is an unwavering desire. These partisans happily renounce many   comforts for the privilege  —   even though it means squeezing into a minuscule space. These are not   individuals who have been painted into a corner, nor are they young professional types starting out in the new  . Many are simply realizing the fantasy of moving to a charmed setting, home size be damned. For others, safe and socially or culturally rich environs are far more alluring than square footage. And then there are those who prize geographic convenience, as well as the emotional liberation of (really)   living. For some, the ultimate New York neighborhood may be Greenwich Village, defined by its winding streets, historic architecture, cozy but chic storefronts and diverse dining options. Roomy digs are less essential when a neighborhood serves as an extension of your living room, wherever in the five boroughs it may be. Vicki Behm and her husband, Glenn Coleman, are Chicago transplants who have lived in New York for 20 years. Their   residential history is a handbook for urban downsizing, as they have managed to achieve, in four happy translocations, the equivalent of reducing a cow to a bouillon cube. “Before buying this place, we sat down and said, ‘This is little, even for us,’ ” recalls Ms. Behm, a painter and public school teacher, while sitting in the snug living     studio of her    residence on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village, several blocks from the Hudson River. An accomplished artist who once favored large, abstract canvases  —   “Not anymore I draw at this table”  —   she had long been drawn to the neighborhood. The couple’s real estate journey in New York began in 1996 when they rented a comfortable   apartment in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. Two years later they purchased a nearby     1840s   townhouse, with three bedrooms and two working marble fireplaces. Four years later, for reasons personal and professional, they decided to move to Manhattan, even if it meant downscaling. Being devotees of modern art, the couple gravitated to the landmark 1936 Rockefeller Apartments, built in the curvaceous International Style, on West 55th Street. Their        was augmented by a     terrace. The building had a private garden and a captivating neighbor, the Museum of Modern Art. “It was nice, well run and fit us well,” Mr. Coleman, a financial journalist, said of the Rockefeller. “Although I don’t miss cutting 24 checks at Christmastime. ” Several years later, they contracted the highly contagious Village virus. “When we were living in Midtown, we used to walk around this neighborhood and say, ‘Gosh, wouldn’t it be great to live here someday?’ ” Ms. Behm recounts. “I never got that out of my mind. ” One day they happened upon a   in a     in a    brick compound of five contiguous buildings that wrap around West 11th and Washington Streets. The setting was ideal. “But the apartment was in really rough shape,” Ms. Behm said. “Even the halls were bad, with that surface like icing on a cake that you can cut yourself on. ” A big plus was the shared roof garden with trees, plants and views of the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building. They bought the     for $660, 000. They executed a complete, historically minded overhaul, including redoing walls and ceilings, and installing period woodwork and period black doorknobs. One small bedroom was turned into a   closet, study and TV room, while the other remained a sleeping space. “Once we got used to it, and it took a little time, we were happy with the move,” Ms. Behm said. “Except those stairs,” Mr. Coleman said. They loved the neighborhood. As the Village goes, West 11th delivers on the swoon meter: gracious old brownstones, inviting restaurants, cafes and bars, an art gallery and a tiny spa. But last summer they learned through the   grapevine that a      in the compound was going on the market. Because the tiny   place opened onto a handsome   courtyard of about 2, 000 square feet, the locals referred to it as a “cottage. ” “And I have always wanted to live in a cottage,” Ms. Behm said, beaming. She soon learned that her infatuation with cottages was shared by a number of other New Yorkers. On the day of the open house, an estimated 250 prospective buyers queued up around the block. Being residents of the   Ms. Behm and Mr. Coleman were on the inside track and purchased it for $825, 000. Their current dwelling is not exactly a   cottage, but it feels like one. The courtyard just outside, where they have put a small table and chairs, belongs to their   Ms. Behm said, but is seldom used by others. After minor alterations, the couple moved in last September. They are more than content. Of course, the smaller you go, the more you heave overboard, Ms. Behm said. “So out goes the Herman Miller sofa and credenza out go my big art books  —   that was hard. The big turkey platter had to go, also my nine cake pans  —   I’ll buy that flourless chocolate cake. ” She also sold all but one of her large paintings. Their cheerful   room features a working fireplace (wood is stored at the bottom of   bookshelves) hardwood floors, tall windows facing the courtyard and an   ceiling. A napkin’s toss away are a    bedroom with a   closet, a cleverly arranged galley kitchen and a small tiled bathroom. The entrance hallway serves as a coat closet. “The apartment doesn’t feel as small as it is,” Mr. Coleman says, “because for seven to eight months of the year the courtyard is part of our living space. ” Christine Kudrav, 30, an executive at a philanthropic foundation in Manhattan, arrived in New York in 2008 from Virginia, landing a   apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, of more than 1, 000 square feet. A roommate came with the package, but considering her means, that was to be expected. ”It was fine,” she recalls. “But back then there were few amenities there, like restaurants and bars, not like it is today. ” This paucity of amenities occasioned a move to a sizable   apartment in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn (also shared) then a      residency in Manhattan in Chelsea  —   three bedrooms, three roommates. After that came a stint in a moderately sized place in a   in Brooklyn Heights with a boyfriend. When her relationship took a downward turn last year, she decided to end her courtship with city rentals and buy something. After exploring Brooklyn neighborhoods like Williamsburg and   Gardens, she set her sights on vibrant Clinton Hill, even though she knew it might be expensive. “I always really loved Clinton Hill, and was willing to go smaller to live there,” she said. And so it was that she bought a    apartment in an 1870   limestone building on Clinton Avenue for $300, 000. Ms. Kudrav had immediately fallen in love with the block  —   an architectural farrago of mostly    structures  —   and the diverse social diversions it afforded. “I like dive bars,” she said. Clinton Hill, it turns out, amply satisfies this thirst. Her home is also a bicycle ride away from two parks, Fort Greene and Prospect  —   “I’m at both constantly when the weather is nice,” she said. Two of her favorite restaurants are in the ’hood: Emily and Taqueria Tepango. She also frequents Olea Mediterranean Taverna and the  Greenlight Bookstore in nearby Fort Greene. Like many   downsizers, Ms. Kudrav rationalized her choice by noting that what she sacrificed on the inside was more than made up for outside. She says the block has become a wing of her home. “I don’t feel closed in,” Ms. Kudrav said. Nor does she miss the clothing and kitchen items she jettisoned. Her   building has a wide, handsome marble and oak foyer where one can envision the children of the original owner, a Union officer in the Civil War, sliding down the gleaming banister. Ms. Kudrav’s dwelling features    ceilings, tall rounded windows and two   clothes closets. A small but functional cooking area is built into one wall  —   she cooked a dinner for eight friends days after moving in  —   with an island that doubles as a table. One   item is a large wooden wall panel that opens to reveal a   Murphy bed. Ms. Kudrav provides a demonstration, lowering the technological marvel and proudly demonstrating how two large pillows can be employed as a headboard. Rather than surrender space to a television, she plans to buy a projector that can display programs on a screen or wall and can be stored in a drawer. “At the beginning, I have to say, I was a little nervous about whether I could make such a small place work,” she conceded. “But this is where I wanted to live, and I feel I made the right decision. ” Nick Demos, 44, a theater producer and director who has a sideline as a yoga teacher, only recently discovered the transcendental contentment of shoe box living. “Look over here,” he called out to a visitor. “This is my tiny kitchen with my tiny refrigerator, my tiny stove and tiny sink. ” The tiny kitchen was aseptically clean, unsullied by edible substances. “I eat out all the time,” he says. A native of Montana, Mr. Demos, whose trim, muscular physique speaks to his earlier career as a Broadway dancer, resided for eight years in Oklahoma City, where he was the artistic director of the Lyric Theater of Oklahoma. When New York called, in 2008, he sold his   ranch, in one day, for the asking price of $150, 000. “I was very, very, very lucky,” he adds. “This was two months before the economy fell. ” Having read about a renaissance in Harlem, he gravitated there, purchasing a    condo in a contemporary building on 148th Street and Bradhurst Avenue, overlooking Jackie Robinson Park  —   comfortable and cheerful enough, with a terrace, a sizable kitchen, good natural light and various amenities for $395, 000. This arrangement sufficed for a number of years, but after a while, the commute to the theater district became old. What is more, the neighborhood’s predicted cultural reawakening was too slow in coming to suit him. “I always, always wanted to live in the Village,” he said. “But until then, especially coming from Oklahoma, I was not sure if I was ready to go as small as it might take to do it. ” Last year, he sold his condo for $550, 000 and went small, really small  —   as in    small. (Well, almost that small: That square footage doesn’t include the dollhouse kitchen or the bathroom.) His spare but sunny studio on West 13th Street near the Avenue of the Americas cost him $425, 000 and is nestled in the rear of a small brick   with a sleek lobby and a   doorman. While the block is not as serene as areas farther west, the kind of amenities he desires are nearby: the New School, the Quad Cinema, an Italian restaurant called Da Andrea and the Jade Hotel Greenwich Village. The apartment, about   neatly made bed, accommodates a small work desk, a bureau, a   bath and what passes for a living room. “This sofa you are sitting on,” he said with a grin, “is half of a sectional  —   got rid of the other half. I could never entertain here. ” He estimates that he has condensed his possessions by 80 percent since Oklahoma. Like many others who have drastically downsized in order to realize their neighborhood dream, Mr. Demos noted that what he has lost in square footage he has gained in convenience and peace of mind. “There is a sense of security in paring down to just the things you absolutely need,” he said. “I work, I go out, I travel, I’m in the neighborhood I want, I come home, I sleep  —   what more do you really need?”
