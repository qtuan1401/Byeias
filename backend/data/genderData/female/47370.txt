’  ’ ”   The Little Tikes log cabin my son received for his third birthday   was a little lacking in   pounds of fancifully   molded plastic and not a toothpick’s worth of wood. What I saw as   kitsch, though, Isaac experienced as an unqualified success. ” ’   From the moment he stepped inside, he reveled in a world suddenly   shrunk down to his scale. Flinging open the shutters for better   light, he looked around. There were a few totems of a     childhood sculpted into the   candlestick   here, a rustic hearth   nothing could compete with the   cabin’’s faux cordless phone. Isaac plucked the orange handset   from its cradle, punched a few numbers, and placed his imaginary   order: ”Hello, Panda? Broccoli, chicken, tofu, beef.” ’ ’   A Panda Express location had opened in Eagle Rock soon after my   wife and I moved into the neighborhood, though it was at least a   decade before I gave it a try. Chinese food can be wonderful, but   in my experience    Chinese food has been about dimly   lit storefronts where exhausted   serve chicken   chow mein or    pork turned into mush and shoe   leather after idling for too many hours in the warming trays. ’ ”   Of course parenthood has a way of drawing you into places you’ve   resolved never to go. Driving home one evening, with my son wide   awake well past his bedtime and not yet fed, I found myself   pulling into the minimall at the bottom of our hill, where the   backlit Panda Express mascot offered us a solution. ” ’   ”Welcome to Panda,” the nearest server shouted, smiling and   making eye contact as we walked through the door. While I joined   a long but rapidly moving line, Isaac pressed ahead, squeezing as   best he could between mostly tolerant patrons to survey his   options: sautéed chicken with string beans, beef with broccoli,   and eggplant tofu. There were too many customers for the entrées   to linger in their steam trays for more than a couple of minutes. ’ ”   The food was in perpetual motion, from wok to serving pan to     or   plate. Neatly stacked bins of raw onions and bell   peppers advertised their freshness. The table we settled at was   immaculate, just as it would be within five minutes of our   departure, despite the cascades of fried rice, chow mein, and     vegetables that fell from Isaac’s fork onto the floor. ” ’  ’ ’   For Isaac, Panda Express became a destination on par with   Disneyland. As we began eating more meals there, I got a sense of   how the place functioned. The cooks, cashiers, and counter people   always exuded energy and a sense of purpose. They appeared to be   working toward something more than at something, and that   something was our satisfaction. ’ ”   The clientele was heavy on teenagers, college students, and   parents with a few kids in tow, but day laborers, elderly   couples, and salespeople from the nearby cell phone outlet were   also among the regulars. All took a certain delight in   customizing their combo plates and having the world revolve   around them, at least for a moment. Panda Express’s ethos, as   well as its food, invited visitors to take things lightly, to   relax and enjoy themselves. ” ’   Friendliness, cleanliness, a   attitude so emphatic it   stopped just short of   these qualities had created   a   oasis of belonging, and not just here in Eagle Rock   but at hundreds of locations across Southern California and   beyond. Who, I found myself wondering, was the driving force   behind this   success story? ’ ’   Who had made this decision to focus more on personal interaction   than on the harsh efficiencies that so often prevail at a     chain? And who had somehow taken one of the most      cuisines and made it sing for less than seven   bucks a heaping plate? Polishing off my eggplant tofu one   evening, I decided to find out. ’ ”   With its balmy weather and superabundance of cars, Southern   California has been the perfect spawning ground for America’s   $191 billion   industry. Of all the   concepts   that blanket the globe, a remarkable   Taco Bell,   Del Taco, Der Wienerschnitzel, and of course McDonald’    hatched on a SoCal street corner. So it should come as no   surprise that the Chinese American restaurant that would lead to   the Panda Express empire, Panda Inn, opened its doors in Pasadena   in 1973. ” ’   Historians of fast food will tell you that if a restaurant   catches on, one of two scenarios will play out. In the first, the   original idea proves bigger than the   entrepreneur who   conceived it, and others with more ambition and managerial   prowess turn it into a phenomenon. ’ ”   Such was the fate of the brothers who founded McDonald’s in San   Bernardino in 1940: They sold their company in its relative   infancy, and in so doing they set the stage for massive growth   but also for an overdependence on cheap labor and cheaper   ingredients (remember pink slime in your burger? ). The other     success story adheres to the    script: The   originators stay in control of not only the enterprise but every   store, none of which is franchised. The company may experience   only modest growth (   has 300 stores) but it has a   reputation for maintaining food quality and treating its workers   well. ” ”   Panda Express follows the latter course to a great degree (fresh   ingredients, a tradition of honoring its employees with higher   pay and better benefits, and no franchises in the United States)   but here’s where it strays from   ’s script: It isn’t tiny.   With nearly 1, 800 outlets in the United States, Mexico, and   Canada, the company achieved more than $2 billion in sales last     times   ’s. ” ’   Headquartered in the San Gabriel Valley, the Panda Restaurant   Group is solely owned by the family that launched it decades ago,   and it is run by one of the most interesting power couples in the   history of American restaurant chains. Andrew and Peggy Cherng   came to the United States as Chinese immigrants in the  . ’ ’   Together they pioneered what is now called ” ”     within the   orbit but serving more   wholesome fare than burger or taco giants do and charging a   dollar or two more for a full meal. Today the Cherngs serve as     of a company that essentially owns the     sector of the   market. Their net worth is estimated at   more than $3 billion. ’ ”   During my first conversation with Andrew at Panda headquarters in   Rosemead, I notice that he never mentions the Firecracker Chicken   Breast, say, or the Beijing Beef. He’s too preoccupied with   outlining his obligations as the company’s motivational coach.   Panda pays famously well.   positions start at $9. 50 an   hour, higher than the industry average, and the wage for Panda   assistant managers is much higher, about $14 an hour. ” ’  ’ ’   That, Andrew tells me, is by design. ”Our job is to develop   people,” he says. Among the benefits employees receive: health   care, paid sick leave and vacation, 401( k)s, and after six months   on the job,   college courses. ”When you have a   good set of people,” he says, ”and they’’re in a good place inside   and   their livelihood and in who they   chances are   they will take care of the customer better.” ’ ”   Cherng has a confident chin, a white crew cut that achieves a   halo effect in the right light, and dark, expressive eyes that   can let you know in a glance what a great job you’re doing or how   much you still need to improve. His voice has a quiet intensity   that demands you listen to him carefully. ” ’   His office, with its expansive view of the San Gabriel Mountains,   is larger than it is luxurious. A Magnavox CD player a few   decades old serves as its sound system. The decor, if you can   call it that, is a ragtag bunch of Buddhas and toy panda bears. ’ ’   For a    who prefers a pedometer to a personal trainer,     a sky blue   oxford shirt embroidered with   the company   to be in decent shape, but he doesn’’t   think so. ”I’’ve been eating so much,” he says, patting an   invisible paunch. ’ ’   Maybe it’’s all the business travel he has to do? ”It’’s not the   travel,” he says. ”It’’s the mouth.” A beat, and he amends that   thought. ”The real issue is, I don’’t have integrity,” he says.   ”That’’s the way I think about it. You say, ’’I’’m not going to do   this,’’ but when you show up, you don’’t follow through. Isn’’t that   how a system breaks down? Because you don’’t have integrity.” ’ ”   If all this sounds a little heavy on the   jargon,   there’s good reason. Seemingly every corner of Panda headquarters   has been designed to promote employee growth. Along the corridors   are motivational posters that urge workers to never stop striving   for   for themselves and the company. On nearly every   desk or bookshelf are copies of such   guides to   betterment as Stephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly   Effective People and Tony Robbins’s   the Giant   Within. ” ”   The company actively encourages its employees to join   Toastmasters International and attend     seminars as retro as Dale Carnegie Training and as New Agey as   the Landmark Forum (which seems a likely source for Cherng’s   integrity lingo). On Saturday mornings the grand auditorium fills   with hundreds of employees, ranging from servers to members of   the Panda Group’s PR and legal teams as well as many of their   children. They gather together for inspiring speeches,     activities, and plenty of group hugs. ” ’   If Andrew Cherng is Panda’’s master motivator and maître d’’ Peggy   Cherng, 67, is its chief technician. A computer scientist who   earned her Ph. D. in the early years of mainframes, she customized   the operations system, financial tracking system, and     management system that have helped turned Panda   Express into a transnational enterprise. She briefs me on the   company’’s ”2020 Vision,” its blueprint for future growth. ’ ”   Peggy wears her hair in a tidy bob. Her soft eyes beneath faint   brows take you in gently, not piercingly. She’s short and   slender, which makes the diamond engagement ring she’s wearing   look even larger than it is. ” ’   Her   suit is elegant but in a way that doesn’’t scream   its designer bona fides. Sitting in her office, ten doors down   from her husband’’s, she tells me their plan is built on reaching   a single goal in the next five years: ”To be recognized as a   world leader in people development.” ’ ’   To demonstrate, she refers to a set of charts she has neatly   organized in anticipation of our meeting. She relies particularly   on a page titled ”Elevating Guest Love,” which features a     pyramid showing elements crucial to maximizing   customer loyalty. At its base is Panda’’s ” .”   The next level is Panda’’s ”People” . e. its   support   the ”Guest” nearest to the pyramid’’s pinnacle. In case anyone is   confused about the importance of the guest’’s happiness, he   appears just below a big green dollar sign. ’ ’  ’ ’   As I sit across from Peggy, I’’m struck by what she doesn’’t talk   about: profits, consumer trends, the stringent performance goals   she sets each year. Instead, much like Andrew, she emphasizes   nourishing the workforce as the surest way to gratify customers.   ”The restaurant business is the people business, and people are   our investment,” she says. ”If we want to be loved by guests, we   have to focus on food with passion and service with heart,   ambience, and pride. If that value equation is really good, then   guests will come.” ’ ”   It’s natural to wonder, as I did initially, whether the Cherngs   are too good to be true. After all, it’s not uncommon for   corporate leaders to tout their enterprises in the most noble   terms, following talking points generated by their PR   departments. ” ’   At first glance, Panda’’s story looks too much like a throwback,   so steeped in the benign capitalist verities of a bygone America   that it’’s hard to believe. Even the Cherngs’’ daughter Andrea, who   happens to be Panda’’s chief marketing officer, acknowledges,   ”Sometimes you can look at what they’’re doing and ask, ’’Is this a   little bit too Mayberry? Is it real? ’’’u2009” ’ ”   Over the next few months, though, my cynicism will wither.   Exploring the empire the Cherngs have built will be like sliding   down the   equivalent of Alice’s rabbit hole to   Wonderland. In Panda’s alternate reality corners are never cut,   quality is never skimped, and the mutuality between a company and   its workers remains as strong as it was during the Eisenhower   era. ” ’   The more I get to know the Cherngs, the more I believe that their   emphasis on employee empowerment is more than just talk. To spend   time in their restaurants is to see a workforce energized by the   promise of upward mobility. ”This idea of a purposeful or   meaningful life is something that Andrew and Peggy are very   dedicated to,” Andrea tells me. It seems likely that their   devotion to the recent immigrants who work for them is based on   the fact that they were once immigrants themselves. ’ ’   The story of Panda Express begins in a hardscrabble town outside   Yangzhou, China. In those days work meant decades of stooping   over   fields battered by dry winds gusting off the     River. By 1947, when Andrew was born (his given name is   Jin Chan Cherng) the country had endured a decade of Japanese   occupation and was then being ravaged by civil war between the   Communists and the Kuomintang. His parents decided it was time to   get out. ’ ”   Andrew’s father,   headed for Taiwan, got a job in a   restaurant, then sent for his family. But after the Communist   takeover, leaving the country became even more difficult.   Cherng’s mother hid in the bottom of a boat with other escapees   but didn’t bring Andrew for fear that his crying would give them   away. Instead she paid a smuggler to get him out. After three   attempts, Andrew was reunited with his mother in Hong Kong. ” ’   The Cherng family eventually immigrated to Yokohama, Japan, where     secured work as a chef. Andrew was an obedient child   who worked hard in school, and he won a scholarship to Baker   University in Kansas. It was there that he met Peggy Tsiang. Like   Andrew, she was Chinese but had been raised off the mainland, in   Burma. ’ ”   A year later she transferred to the University of Missouri to   study computer science, working toward her doctorate by   developing a   program that digitized     and applied algorithms to diagnose congenital heart disease. Soon   Andrew would join Peggy in Missouri, where he earned his master’s   in applied mathematics. ” ”   They married after moving to Los Angeles, where Andrew briefly   managed a restaurant in Hollywood owned by his cousin. Having   spent his college summers working in New York City as a maître   d’ though, he wanted to run his own place. He persuaded his   parents to come to L. A. to help him realize that dream. ” ’   Panda Inn opened on Foothill Boulevard, and from the start it was   a family effort.   was head chef; ”Mama” cooked the rice   and washed the dishes; Andrew provided the hospitality,   leadership, and charisma. Business was slow at first. Andrew   would try to lure passersby by offering them three entrées for   the price of two or plying them with a free cocktail. ’ ’   Though the place struggled, he told his mother he planned to   someday open 99 more restaurants. Mama Cherng, now 89, remembers   being flabbergasted. ”You only eat three meals a day. What do you   need 100 restaurants for?” she said to him. But that didn’’t   dissuade him. ”He was a good child who usually did listen,” she   told me, ”but in that instance he didn’’t.” ’ ”   Among Panda Inn’s growing list of loyal customers was Pat   Donahue, whose family owned the Glendale Galleria. Andrew was in   the process of launching a second Panda Inn, in Glendale, but he   was intrigued when Donahue told him that the Galleria would be   opening a new food court. Would Andrew consider a     version of Panda Inn there? In 1983, Andrew made that happen with   the first Panda Express. ” ’  ’ ”   By that point  ’d been working as a computer programmer   at McDonnell Douglas before joining 3M’s aerospace     decided to put aside her engineering career to help her husband   with accounting and payroll. As the   concept exploded,   she became a   IT department, developing      terminals and   software to track inventory,   purchasing, and shifts in customer behavior. ” ’   Peggy’’s technical prowess gave Panda Express an edge, as it   provided the upstart company with perhaps better qualitative   feedback than even the   giants had at their disposal.   ”The kitchen area is low tech,” Peggy says, ”but the management   system can be high   to catch the data, how to analyze   data to see what’’s most salable, what’’s not selling, and to   determine what to offer and what not to offer.” ’ ’   Within a decade the potent combination of Andrew’’s ambition and   Peggy’’s   skills was responsible for more than 100   restaurants. Peggy’’s programs also enabled the company to procure   with as little spoilage as possible the fresh ingredients it   needed to offer a menu vastly more complex than other     places offered. ”Andrew’’s vision is that he doesn’’t see anything   that’’s not possible,” Peggy says. ”But visionaries need a system   and structure to provide the growth.” ’ ”   They also need success stories, and Panda Express didn’t lack for   those, either. Restaurants in Southern California rely heavily on   Latino immigrants, and Panda is no exception. Take Daniel   Pelagio. He was born to farming parents in a small village in   Guerrero, Mexico. The poverty was stark. There was no electricity   or cars, and the closest drinkable water was a quarter mile away.   When he turned 18, Pelagio crossed the border illegally and   settled in Santa Ana. His cousin Jose was already working at a   Panda Express in the Westminster Mall, and Daniel was hired on   the spot, despite speaking no English. ” ’   By the end of his first year at Panda, he was promoted to cook,   then assistant manager and general manager. Peggy and Andrew took   an interest in his enthusiastic spirit. As Panda continued to   expand beyond California, they tapped Pelagio to help train staff   in Arizona and Las Vegas. He embraced the Panda credo of constant      the books, the seminars. ’ ”   Today at 42, Pelagio is the regional director for Panda’s     region, which means he presides over 69 stores in   three states, supervising their financials, training, and   recruiting as well as directing community outreach and charitable   giving through the Panda Cares foundation. He is also pursuing an   online bachelor’s degree in business administration. ” ’   ”When I first worked at Panda, I just looked at it as a job and   wasn’’t really thinking to grow with the company,” Pelagio says.   ”But Panda is about how people can have a better life, and I can   feel now that I am a living product of that.” ’ ”   The   business has never been known for this kind of   investment in   employees; recently, in fact, it’s been   known mostly for the opposite. Since the 2008 recession, the   response to declining sales, higher health care costs, and   agitation for better pay has been to thin out the workforce and   invest in automation technology to make even more reductions in   the near future. ” ’   Wall Street typically applauds belt tightening, but Bonnie     as senior restaurant analyst for the NPD Group,   conducts market research on behalf of McDonald’’s and other major   corporate   there may be a   cost. ”With   the recession the industry cut back on hiring staff, and service   has suffered,” Riggs says. ”Some concepts have suffered for it   because service is part of what consumers consider value. ’ ’   If there are happy employees, and the customer knows they’’re   happy and treated well, then they’’re going to come back. The only   way to grow a business in this marketplace today is to build   loyalty and to have repeat business. And I would suggest that   Panda Express probably has some very loyal customers.” ’ ’   Andrea Cherng was four years old when Panda Express debuted at   the Glendale Galleria. By the time she was a teenager, the   company was opening dozens of new locations a year. Andrew and   Peggy made it clear to their daughter and her two younger sisters   that such precipitous growth meant an   list of   dependents the whole family was responsible for. ”At dinner or   the breakfast table,” Andrea recalls, ”my parents would ask me,   ’’What are you going to do for our people? ’’ far before I could do   anything for our people.” ’ ”   Andrea took that to heart, though she didn’t come to Panda right   away. With her law degree from Duke and her M. B. A. from Wharton,   she worked elsewhere in the private sector before joining her   parents’ company in her midthirties. Of the Cherngs’ kids, only   Andrea has embraced Panda as a career (Nicole is a real estate   investor, and Michelle is a teacher). ” ’  ’ ’   As part of her brief, Andrea oversees the Panda Express   Innovation Kitchen, a restaurant in Pasadena where Panda tries   out new recipes and ideas for improving its decor and ambience.   At its grand opening last year, the emphasis was on        wraps, a   iteration of the   kind of customized burrito that has proved popular at Chipotle   Mexican Grill. A plush tea and boba   is being piloted   there. ’ ’   ”The Innovation Kitchen is like a concept car,” Andrea says. ”The   products there can be replicated throughout the entire system   three to five years out.” Ever since Panda Express expanded to   Hawaii in 1987, for example, the Cherng family’’s annual vacation   to the Islands has been a working one. ’ ’   Two new tea bars have recently opened at Panda locations in   Honolulu. ”To introduce   teas to a much wider   population is incredibly exciting,” Andrea says, noting that   while in Hawaii recently she studied the varying configurations   of the two bars and discussed ”how to provide better support in   terms of    and evolve the experience.” Given how   busy she was at work, she never made it to the shoreline. ”I saw   the ocean,” she says, grinning. ”It was beautiful.” ’ ’   Despite the sense of obligation she was raised with, Andrea says   she does not assume she will one day follow in her mother and   father’’s footsteps. ”Ownership might be inherited,” she says,   ”but leadership is not. I wouldn’’t have taken the role I have   now, and Andrew and Peggy quite frankly wouldn’’t have me take   that role unless I was the best person for the job at this time.   And when I’’m not the best person for this job, I hope I will have   the wisdom to exit and find my next opportunity.” ’ ’   Recently Andrea and her father had nearly finished a visit to a   Panda Express in La Cañada Flintridge when they noticed an     day laborer who had just pushed his debilitated   truck (it appeared to have a broken axle) into a nearby parking   space. ”So Andrew asks, ’’Where’’s Triple A? ’’,’u2009” Andrea remembers.   ”’u2009’’We need to get Triple A to help that man. ’’’u2009” One of the   assistant managers spoke to the man in Spanish and reassured him   that a tow truck was on the way. With the others out of earshot,   Andrew acknowledged that there was only so much he could do.   ”Sort of quietly and on the side, he said, ’’I wish that everybody   worked at Panda,’’’u2009” his daughter recalls, ”’u2009’’because if everybody   worked for Panda, than everybody could afford a nice car. ’’’u2009” ’ ’   It’’s clear that ”our Panda family”  when invoked by Panda’’s   chief marketing   far from just another marketing   slogan. Given that, the question of succession seems crucial to   the company’’s future. What would happen if a business so   predicated on filial ties suddenly had at its head a professional   manager for whom ”family” was more of a talking point than a   belief system? Would the floors still be kept as immaculate?   Would the vegetables always be fresh; the meat, always tender?   Would the servers smile as broadly when a hungry father and son   walk through the doors? ’ ’   A couple of years ago we gave Isaac’’s log cabin to a neighbor,   but it was missing the cordless phone on which Isaac had   ”ordered” his first   meal. I found it a few weeks later and   kept it. Today my son is ten and much more interested in iPhones   than toy phones. Still, his excitement when he enters a Panda   Express and elbows his way toward the warming trays is   undiminished. ’ ’   There the Cherngs have created a working environment so much   kinder than most. In a world too often marked by a paucity of     jobs, a dearth of opportunity, and a lingering   threat of being replaced by someone somewhere in the world who   can do your job for less, the Cherngs have kept their alternative   reality alive. I like the idea that the   Isaac might   someday be able to dial up one of their restaurants, exclaim,   ”Hello, Panda? ,” and hear an unfailingly cheerful voice on the   other end. ’ ’The Little Tikes log cabin my son received. ..’
