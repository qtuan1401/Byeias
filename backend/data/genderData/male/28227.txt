A year after Lindsay Lohan was first seen clutching a Koran, the   child star has admitted that she is “really open to learning” about Islam. [“I’m not done reading it. Do you know how long that would take? It takes so long,” Lohan said of her conversion to Islam in a recent interview. “America has portrayed holding a Koran in such a different way to what it actually is. ”  The Mean Girls actress has spent the last several years in and out of jail and rehab. Her first rehab stint came in January 2007. “I have made a proactive decision to take care of my personal health,” the     said. The   Koran photo was captured while Lohan was leaving her first day of her community service at a New York kids’ centre, a court ordered punishment that stemmed from a 2012 reckless driving charge. “My sister is Buddhist, but she is interested in learning other things from me. It’s good to be ” Lohan said. “We all believe in something and at the end of the day it all ties to a God or a spiritual adviser. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
