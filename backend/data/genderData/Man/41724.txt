In China, they’re known as ”nail houses”     homes where owners refuse to accept compensation offered by road builders and developers in exchange for the demolition of their property. The dwellings stand like a nail that refuses to be hammered down     a not uncommon phenomenon as some homeowners resist dispossession of their land or hold out for more money.
