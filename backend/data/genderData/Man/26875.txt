During his talk on     at the University of   MILO described the now excommunicated Black Lives Matter figurehead Shaun King as the “whitest black supremacist in America. ”[  “I’ve saved a very special friend for last, Shaun King. He is the whitest black supremacist in America, and was booted out of Black Lives Matter following my reporting on his heritage,” he said. “The best way to know Shaun King is white is the way he threw his mom under the bus when it was alleged he wasn’t half black. What black guy would do that to his own mama?” he continued.  The reporting referred to was when Shaun King’s family members confirmed to Breitbart that despite claiming to be black and the victim of extensive racial abuse, he is in fact fully white. He went on to describe King as the “ultimate Black Lives Matter opportunist” who “has engaged in so much strange behavior over the last year I’m not going to waste your time trying to catalogue it. ” However he said his favourite Shaun King moment was when “he wrote me a bizarre email claiming I am obsessed with him, the NRA is a white supremacist organization and that the game of pool is a racial symbol. I suppose because the white cue ball hits the colored balls?” he said. “And if all that wasn’t enough, Shaun King also looks eerily similar to Manny Escuela, a character from Grand Theft Auto 4,” he added.
