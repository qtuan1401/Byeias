President Obama has kowtowed to the Japanese and Western liberals by promising at the site of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb “we shall not repeat the evil. ”[People who agree with this sentiment ought to do two things.  First they should read the essay  —   Thank God for the Atom Bomb  —   war historian Paul Fussell wrote on how he felt when, as a    second lieutenant in the US army, he and his comrades heard the news that Japan had been nuclear bombed into surrender. “When we learned to our astonishment that we would not be obliged in a few months to rush up the beaches near Tokyo   while being   mortared, and shelled, for all the practiced phlegm of our tough facades we broke down and cried with relief and joy. We were going to live. ” Second, they should familiarize themselves with which country it was started this particular war which country fought it with such sadistic determination that they would frequently torture and bayonet prisoners  —   even the wounded, in hospitals they’d   and would almost always refuse to surrender themselves, making any assault on territory they held more than usually costly in allied lives. If ever the US finds itself in such circumstances again, let us pray that the president it has at the time is nothing like Barack Obama.
