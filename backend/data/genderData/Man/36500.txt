 (CNN) Highland Reel claimed victory in the King George the VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Royal Ascot racecourse in Berkshire, England, Saturday. The   favorite, ridden by Ryan Moore, edged out Wings of Desire into second while Dartmouth, owned by UK monarch, Queen Elizabeth, could only place third.  The last time Britain’s head of state owned the winner of the Group One contest named after her parents was when Aureole galloped home in 1954. And she will have to wait at least one more year to notch up another win in the King George. Saturday’s win marked a fourth success in the prestigious event for Highland Reel trainer, Aidan O’Brien. ”The horse has been progressing all the time and we couldn’t be happier,” O’Brien said in comments carried by the UK’s Press Association news agency. ”Ryan gave him a beautiful ride. This is an incredible horse. As everyone knows, he travels the world and he’s getting better, which is amazing.” Moore pushed his mount out in front early before easing off the gas which allowed the field to close. Yet he picked up the pace again in the closing stages to finish a length and a half ahead of the chasing Wings of Desire. ”He’s a very strong horse,” Moore said after the race. ”He’s very professional   he knows how to race.” ”It’s a marvelous achievement from Aidan to get him back in this shape to win this sort of race,” Moore added.
