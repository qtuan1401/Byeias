While ESPN’s Bob Ley was reporting on “SportsCenter” after the Tampa Bay Rays vs. Cuba national team game in Havana, Cuba, a political protester hopped up on the set.  The protester got next to Ley on live television, and another started throwing pamphlets in the air. The man was promptly removed from the set, but Ley had to cut his report short for the time being. A few minutes later, ESPN went back to Ley, who said he was OK. Ley reported that authorities came “literally out of nowhere” to arrest a total of six protesters, whose pamphlets were “for the rights and liberties calling for a meeting calling for reforms in Cuban law. For new laws, for amnesty having to do with the freedoms. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
