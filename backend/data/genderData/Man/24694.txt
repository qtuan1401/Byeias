On May 13 BET claimed there were “over 500”   deaths in   Chicago in 2015, yet only “55 of them resulted in a legitimate investigation. ”[So many of the dead were black males from Chicago’s south side and their demise made   violence the “leading cause of death for black men between the ages of 18 and 34. ”  BET laments that such deaths do not cause an outcry the way the July 2012 Aurora theater shooting or the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary did. At Aurora, James Holmes used firearms he had acquired via a background check to kill 12 innocents and wound another 70. In the Sandy Hook attack, Adam Lanza carried a stolen rifle into the school and killed 20 students plus six adults. But at a rate of “over 500” in 2015, BET points out that deaths are regularly occurring in   Chicago. To make their point they spoke to Pam Bosely, whose    son Terrell was shot and killed on Chicago’s south side on April 4, 2006. Pam believes that people around the country chalk Chicago deaths up to gang violence and then move on with their day. She said, “People assume that these kids deserve to be dead, even though nobody deserves to be shot and killed. ” Chicago has an “assault weapons” ban, a “violence tax” —  which raises the price on every gun sold at retail in Chicag0 —  and they have strict limitations on the number of gun stores and the locations of those stores. Moreover, the New York Times describes Chicago handgun restrictions as being so strict they allow city leaders to “get as close as they could get legally to a ban without a ban. ” But all these gun controls have correlated with more murder, not less. Yet BET reacts to all the   deaths in   Chicago by calling for more gun control on licensed gun dealers.
