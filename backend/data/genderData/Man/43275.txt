’  ’ ’   The Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys to advance to the   NFC Championship with the help of tight end Jared Cook. ’ ’   Tied at   with 12 seconds to play, Aaron Rodgers and the   Packers facing    from their own 33, with an overtime   looking more and more likely. ’ ’   Rodgers took the snap peeled out to his left and threw a laser   that hit Cook along the sideline. While Cook made the catch, it   was initially called out. ’ ’   However, a referee overruled the initial call and ruled it a   catch. Replays then showed that Cook made perhaps the best catch   of his career, corralling the ball over the sideline as he   balanced on his toes with both feet inbounds. ’ ’   A   reception that put the Packers in   range.   Incredible. ’ ’ ’ ’   Another look: ’ ’ ’ ’   Mason Crosby then kicked a   field goal as time expired to   win the game for the Packers.  ’ ’   Cook had a monster game, catching six passes for 104 yards and a   touchdown. No catch was bigger than his       catch that set up the win for the Packers. ’ ’   Green Bay will take on Atlanta in the NFC Championship next   Sunday. ’
