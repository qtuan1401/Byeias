”   Apple is making a competitor to Amazon’s Echo speaker, and it   features a familiar voice: Siri. Apple’s new device is called   HomePod, and it marries Apple’s Siri digital assistant to a home   speaker. ” ’   Here it is: ’ ’  ’ ’   The device was announced on stage during Apple’’s annual WWDC   developer event in San Jose, California, and it arrives ”later   this year” according to Apple. HomePod is seven inches tall, and   is intended as a ”breakthrough” speaker in addition to being a   personal assistant. ’ ”   The HomePod is covered in cloth, which hides an array of speakers   within  —   it plays music in all directions, but it’s aware of   whatever space it’s in and directs sounds accordingly. It’s   powered by Apple Music, Apple’s subscription music service, and   connects directly. ” ’  ’ ’   A set of six microphones are also hidden within HomePod, enabling   it to work with Siri by voice commands. ’ ’   ”You can be across the room and speak to the HomePod even while   loud music is playing,” Apple’’s Phil Schiller said during the   introduction presentation. He referred to Siri as the HomePod’’s     ”musicologist.”  ’ ’   Beyond just controlling music, you can control any ”HomeKit”   devices through HomePod  —   that means stuff like Phillips Hue   lighting, Nest thermostats, and other smart devices. Like   Amazon’’s Echo, you’’ll speak to Siri by saying, ”Hey Siri.” ’ ”   Let’s say you want to turn on your Phillips Hue lights, for   instance. Let’s play that out: ” ’   ”Hey Siri, turn on the kitchen lights.”  ’ ”   That’s it! It’s very similar to Google’s   combo,   Home, in this respect. ” ’  ’ ”   HomePod costs $349 to start, it launches this December, and it’s   only available in the US, UK, and Australia at launch. ” ”Apple is making a competitor to Amazon’s Echo. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
