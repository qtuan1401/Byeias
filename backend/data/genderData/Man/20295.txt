During Saturday night’s South Carolina Republican debate, when questioned on the issue of replacing   Court Justice Antonin Scalia, John Kasich said that if President Obama is going to nominate someone, he hoped the president would “pick somebody that’s going to have unanimous approval, and such wide spread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination. ”  I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody. If you were to nominate somebody, let’s have him pick somebody that’s going to have unanimous approval, and such wide spread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination. I don’t think that’s going to happen, and I would like the President just to for once here put the country first. We’re going to have an election for President very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election. Obama has already promised to nominate a replacement. For his part, Kasich never urged the   Senate to block the president’s nearly unprecedented effort to nominate a Supreme Court justice during a presidential election year.
