More than 728, 000 illegal immigrants have been shielded from being deported and granted work permits through President Barack Obama’s 2012 executive amnesty program, according to the Migration Policy Institute. [With the four year anniversary of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program fast approaching on August 15, MPI released its latests estimates on the population of DACA beneficiaries and those eligible to participate Thursday  —   detailing that about half of the eligible population of illegals are participating in the controversial amnesty.  MPI estimates that this year 1. 3 million illegal immigrants are “immediately eligible” to apply for DACA and another 398, 000 illegals are eligible but for the high school diploma or current school enrollment requirement. Those 398, 000 truant illegals could become eligible if they enroll in adult education. In all, from the program’s inception to March 31, 2016, the Obama Administration has accepted over 820, 000 DACA applications for the   renewable amnesty and approved 728, 285 (or 89 percent) of them and denied another 57, 268 (seven percent). The remaining 33, 959 (four percent) were pending. The DACA renewal rate is currently 93 percent. “Examining DACA application rates against the MPI population estimates suggests that 63 percent of the immediately eligible population had applied as of March 2016 the rate fell to 48 percent when including the share that did not appear to meet the educational criteria but may have enrolled in a qualifying adult education population,” MPI’s report reads. Most of the DACA applications have been filed by illegal immigrants from Mexico (634, 000) followed by El Salvador (31, 000) Guatemala (22, 000) and Honduras (20, 000). While Mexico and Central America boasted the most illegal immigrants seeking executive amnesty, illegal immigrants from Asia had much lower DACA application levels. As MPI details, the states with the highest application rates, or states in which over 75 percent of the immediately eligible applied, were Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon, and Texas. Those on the lower end of that spectrum, or those states with an application rate among the immediately eligible lower than 50 percent were Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Virginia, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and Florida.
