Language warning]  In an interview with Variety magazine released on Sunday, comedienne Lena Dunham took aim at the media for its portrayal of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. According to Dunham, that portrayal has been sexist and it would be worthwhile to offer the media a list of words that were forbidden when describing Clinton. “The way that Hillary Clinton’s been talked about in the media is so gendered and rabidly sexist in every single portrayal,” Dunham said. “Adjectives  —   whether it’s attacks on her personal life or the adjectives that are used to describe her clothing  —   we have to do a full reexamination. I really want to do a list that we hand to media outlets that says, ‘These are the words you can’t use when describing a female candidate: shrill, inaccessible, difficult, frumpy, and plastic.’ I mean there’s just a list of words. If we were allowed to talk about male candidates like that, I’d have a fucking field day. I’d enjoy my life so much. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
