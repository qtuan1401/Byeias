’  ’ ”   It used to be that Lululemon was synonymous with women’s apparel    —   specifically its acclaimed yoga pants. ” ”   But in 2015, all that changed during a call when  the men’s ABC   (  ) pants were one of the company’s     items. ” ’ favorably, calling them   comfortable and versatile. Others, like Wall Street analyst Paul   Lejuez of Citi, also praised the $128 pants. ’ ’   ”I’’ll just admit it, [Lululemon’’s] Commission and ABC pants are   the most comfortable pants I own,”  ’ ’   Lejuez said he would wear them to work if it weren’’t for one   thing: ”There is a black logo on the side of the knee,” he said. ’ ’’ ”   When we reviewed the pants, we didn’t really think much of the   logo, but our casual office we wore them in probably had   something to do with that. A man dressing for a traditional   banking setting like Lejuez would have more of an issue. And   since this is the type of customer Lululemon is attempting to   reach for its men’s brand, this is a major problem. ” ’ noticed the logo, taking   issue with how visible it is. They criticized the pants’’ logo for   making obvious the wearer did not have ”normal” khaki pants on. ’ ’   ”I wouldn’’t like it if Levi’’s had a big Levi’’s logo on the pant   leg, let alone if a company that’’s mostly known for women’’s   clothes,”  Business Insider’’s former visual   features editor. ”If Lululemon people out there are listening,   take that off. It looks stupid.” ’ ’   For Lejuez, it was less about the logo specifically and more   about having a logo at all. ’ ’   ”I can’’t risk getting called out wearing yoga pants to work,” he   said. ”I couldn’’t have a Nike or [Under Armour] logo on the   side of my knee either. It just isn’’t an acceptable place for a   logo on ’’work pants. ’’ So I don’’t wear them to work.” ’ ’   The solution, to Lejuez, is easy. ’ ’   ”Take away the logo, open up a new market,” he said. ’
