Washington (CNN) A   Blackhawk helicopter crashed on a golf course in Leonardtown, Maryland, during a routine training exercise Monday, killing one crew member and injuring two others, according to the US Army Military District of Washington. Spc. Jeremy Darrell Tomlin, 22, a   crew chief, died at the scene, the Army announced Tuesday. The aircraft carrying three crew members that crashed at Breton Bay Golf Course was from the 12th Aviation Battalion, stationed at Davison Airfield at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Chief Warrant Officer Christopher Nicholas, a pilot, and Capt. Terikazu Onoda were injured in the incident, according to the US Army. Both are listed in critical condition.
