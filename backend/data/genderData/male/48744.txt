’  ’ ’   The Buffalo Bills came up with perhaps the most surprising win of   Week 4, beating the New England Patriots   in Foxborough,   Massachusetts. ’ ”   It was the first time the Patriots have been shut out since 2006,   and the first time they’ve been shut out at home since 1993. ” ”   It all went wrong for the Patriots, who, behind rookie   quarterback Jacoby Brissett, couldn’t get their offense going   throughout the entire game. ” ”   Afterward, Bills coach Rex Ryan seemed to have some fun at the   Patriots’ expense. In his postgame interview, he seemingly mocked   the   decision by the Patriots to start Brissett over   Jimmy Garoppolo, who is still injured. ” ’   ”My sources inside the Patriots building told me Jacoby Brissett   would be the QB,” Ryan quipped. ”How about that? I’’ll stir some   stuff up.” ’ ’’ ’   Ryan appears to have thought the Patriots were trying to throw   off the Bills by not revealing their starting quarterback until   right before the  . Ryan also said he wasn’’t too concerned   with whoever was running the offense for the Patriots, saying the   Bills ”expected” a win because neither Garoppolo or Brissett are   as good as Tom Brady. ’ ”   The importance of the win can’t be understated for the Bills.   They’re now   going into a Week 5 game against the Los Angeles   Rams. After dropping their first two games, the Bills looked like   they were in danger of going   to start the year, with matchups   with the Arizona Cardinals and Patriots ahead. Instead, they won   both games and now sit second in the AFC East behind the     Patriots. The win also gives them a   lead over the New   York Jets, who fell to   on Sunday. ” ’   Who knows if Ryan actually has sources inside the Patriots or if   he wants to taunt them over the win (). But   nobody in the NFL enjoys a win over Bill Belichick more than Rex   Ryan. ’
