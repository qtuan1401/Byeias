The   organization Planned Parenthood endorsed Hillary Clinton for president Thursday. [The group’s action fund, which plans to drop $20 million into the 2016 elections, announced the endorsement, and Clinton plans to formally accept the group’s support at a campaign rally Sunday in New Hampshire.  In a statement issued Thursday, Clinton pledged to “defend against attacks on reproductive health care, and protect access to affordable contraception and safe and legal abortion across the country. ” As Breitbart News reported, Clinton hired Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards’ daughter Lily Adams to be her Iowa communications director. Cecile Richards is the daughter of former Texas governor Ann Richards, who lost to George W. Bush in the 1994 gubernatorial race, and Lily Adams is Ann Richards’ granddaughter. When Breitbart News visited Clinton’s campaign office in the   political hotspot of Iowa City, this reporter was referred to Lily Adams, who is ostensibly managing the operation there. Clinton steadfastly defended Planned Parenthood during its baby   scandal, in which group officials were caught making big bucks dealing fetal tissue from babies killed in the group’s abortion procedures.
