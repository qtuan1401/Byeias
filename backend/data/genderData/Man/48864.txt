’  ’ ’   Boban Marjanovic emerged as  last season,   and it paid off. ’ ’   The    Serbian center signed a   $21 million   contract with the Detroit Pistons in the offseason, reaping the   rewards for the potential he showed in averaging 5 points and 3   rebounds in nine minutes per game. ’ ’  ’ ’   Though the Spurs will miss him, head coach Gregg Popovich also   knew Marjanovic was going to get offers in free agency. ’ ’   ”We knew he was gone,” .   ”It happens to every team. You lose a guy because you have to pay   people and you can’t pay them all.” ’ ’   But according to Popovich, he had to push Marjanovic to take the   offer. ’ ’   ”He’s such a good kid, at some point I had to work to get him to   understand that $21 million was different than $3 million. I   said, ‘Get your ass out of here. Go. You’ve got to do it.’ But he   felt bad.” ’ ”   With the Spurs already tying up about $52 million to Kawhi   Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Tony Parker, then bringing in Pau   Gasol and   Manu Ginobili for a combined $39 million,   they couldn’t afford to bring Marjanovic back at that price. ” ”   Still, it’s refreshing that Popovich didn’t try to persuade   Marjanovic to stay in San Antonio on a discount when bigger   paychecks awaited him in Detroit. ”
