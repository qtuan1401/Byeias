’  ’ ’   The pound has been hammered in trade today after French president   François Hollande called for a hard Brexit for the UK. ’ ’   Hollande didn’t hold back in front of EU president     Juncker, according to a story that ran in the  when he said “we must go all   the way through the UK’s willingness to leave the EU. We have to   have this firmness”. ’ ’   “If not, we would jeopardise the fundamental principles of the   EU,” he warned, suggesting the EU needs to make an example of   Britain so that other nations considering leaving will know they   can’t do it without a cost. ’ ’   According to pricing provided by Thomson Reuters, the     fell to as low 1. 1819 within a matter of minutes, some 6. 3% below   Thursday’s closing level. ’ ’   It was the largest downside move in the pound since June 24, the   day after the UK Brexit referendum. It briefly left the     known as Cable or Stirling in markets, trading at the lowest   level seen since March 1985. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   It’s almost certainly a flash crash that coincided with the   release of the FT article. The scale and the speed of the drop   was likely exacerbated by weak volumes ahead of tonight’s     US   payrolls report. ’ ’   Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in   Melbourne, agrees. ’ ’   “This [the FT article] didn’t cause a 770 pip move, but it did   push cable through 1. 2600 and from here algo’s,   selling   and thin liquidity took over,” he said moments after the plunge. ’ ’   Buyers have pulled their bids on the downside as fears over just   how hard the British exit from the European Union will be, making   a mockery of the   relief that the June 23 decision   didn’t cause chaos on markets. ’
