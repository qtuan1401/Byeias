’  ’ ”   Samumed is a $12 billion private biotech startup you’ve probably   never heard of. ” ’   The San   company has attracted $300 million in funding   and a heady valuation thanks to a pipeline of what could be   revolutionary treatments to regenerate hair, skin, bones, and   joints. ’ ’   It offers the promise of reversing conditions related to aging by   regrowing hair on balding heads, smoothing out wrinkles, and   regenerating cartilage to   joints in people with   osteoarthritis. ’ ’   If that seems to be too good to be true, the company is well   aware. ’ ’   ”We get that reaction from anyone who actually listens to our   story,” CEO Osman Kibar told Business Insider in January. ’ ”   That skepticism has only grown with the company’s valuation,   which is now one of the highest for a private biotech company.   The firm’s list of backers  —   lacking as it does specialist   healthcare investors  —   and secrecy over its science have also   raised questions. ” ”   Then there’s Theranos, the onetime $9 billion startup that has    over the     space. ” ”   Cevdet Samikoglu, Samumed’s chief financial officer, understands   all of that. In fact, he asked many of the same questions.   Samikoglu met Kibar more than 30 years when they both attended   Robert College, a high school in Istanbul. Kibar had worked in   venture capital, launched a company that later sold to pharma   giant Novartis, and eventually created an incubator where he came   across the technology that would become the backbone for Samumed. ” ’   Samikoglu signed on as an investor in Samumed initially in 2007,   at which point he asked the same question. ’ ’   ”I’’d basically badger [Kibar] with that question time and again,”   Samikoglu said. ”When I came on board, the first few months I was   kind of thinking about that, ’’I can’’t believe we’’re sitting on   this, I can’’t believe the potential of it. ’’” ’ ’   Unlike Theranos, Samumed has been open about presenting its data,   and before it gets to the market, the treatments will have to be   approved by the FDA. ’ ’   In the end, Samikoglu simply became too busy to think about it. ’ ’   ”We might be sitting on a molecule that already has the answer,”   he said. ”But taking that and making it into a drug is a     struggle.” ’ ”   Your body is equipped with something called progenitor stem   cells. These cells are in charge of repairing and replenishing   specific organs in the body. For example, a mesenchymal stem cell   of the osteoblast lineage can go in and repair bone that’s   damaged. That process has something to do with the WNT pathway, a   set of proteins that tell these stem cells to spring into action. ” ’   ”By dialing up or down various WNT genes or WNT processes, you   can trigger any one of these progenitor stem cells down a certain   lineage,” Kibar said. ’ ’   As we get older, our WNT levels start to get out of balance,   Kibar said. Take the example of mesenchymal stem cells. ”If the   WNT activity levels can no longer increase such that it’’s not   making enough bone, now you develop osteoporosis.” ’ ”   What Samumed hopes to do is manipulate the pathway that makes   these progenitor stem cells spring into action, so that they   don’t cause these diseases. ” ’   For example, Samumed has a treatment for androgenetic alopecia, a   . The idea is that by using the   treatment, people with alopecia will be able to regrow some of   their lost hair follicles, which are the layer of cells and   connective tissue that envelop the root of a hair and are   critical for its growth. ’ ’  ’ ’   So far, the data looks promising. ’ ’   A   trial (the stage at which drugs are ) presented in 2016 to the American Academy   of Dermatology  of a topical treatment called SM04554   in about 300 men ages  . The men were split into three   groups: a placebo group, a group given a . 15% dose of the   treatment, and a group given a . 25% dose of the treatment. ’ ’   At the end of 135 days, those given the lower dose saw the most   hair growth with an increase of roughly 10%. Those on the higher   dose saw an increase of about 7%. And those on the placebo, not   surprisingly, continued to lose hair. ’ ’   In a  49 men were split into the same three groups.   They had the skin on top of their heads biopsied at the   beginning, after 90 days, and at the end of the   trial.   That gave the researchers a peek into what was happening at the     level. They found that those taking the two doses   had greater   growth than the placebo group,   confirming what the other study saw on the surface, Samumed chief   medical officer Yusuf Yazici told Business Insider. ’ ’   In the second study, those on the . 25% had slightly more follicle   growth than the . 15% group. To get an even better picture of how   the treatments work long term, Samumed is setting up another     trial that will include both doses to figure out which   one is the best to use in a  that could set the treatment up for   approval with the FDA. ’ ’   Samumed will have to show that the treatment works better than   placebo in regenerating hair. And even then there is still some   skepticism about how long the effects will last. ’ ’   ”Can you generate a   tissue that can negotiate its   way through to aging, fibrosis, damage, and stay put all these   years?” Dr. Shahin Rafii, a professor of genetic medicine at   Weill Cornell Medical College told Business Insider. Rafii is one   of the scientific founders of Angiocrine Sciences, a company   using endothelial cells to repair tendons and treat lung   diseases. ’ ”   While Samumed’s   program might have the most data to   date, its osteoarthritis program is the closest to getting into a     trial, Yazici said. That program is trying to   regenerate cartilage in the knee to replace what’s lost in   patients with osteoarthritis, a condition that affects . If it’s successful, it could be the first   treatment to regrow cartilage. ” ’   Samumed has seven drugs in human clinical trials up to phase two   and plans to be in 10 disease areas by the end of 2017. Samumed   is also applying its   technology to treatments for   colon cancer,   disease, and tendinopathy, as   well as to cosmetics in order to wipe out wrinkles. ’ ’   When Kibar first asked Samikoglu to sign on about seven years   ago, and he decided to relocate from New York to California, his   wife asked, ”How long will this adventure last in San Diego?” ’ ”   At the time, he told her that he expected it to be a few years   before the company was able to get to an initial public offering.   Now, it’s looking like the company might not go public until it   can get an approved product and start generating revenue, Kibar   said at the Forbes Healthcare Summit in December 2016. ” ’   ”In an ideal world, I think every biotech company would want to   remain private so they can focus only on the science, without   thinking about what the market requires,” Samikoglu said. ”We are   that lucky company.” ’ ’   The $12 billion valuation Samumed has right now is based on the   $300 million it has raised over the years. The valuation grew   based on its lead compound, with the rest of the pipeline thrown   in as a ”freebie,” Kibar said. ’ ’   The valuation is among the highest in biotech. Stemcentrx, a     company, had a $5 billion valuation before it was   bought by AbbVie in a $10. 2 billion deal. And Moderna   Therapeutics is edging up on a $5 billion valuation, . ’ ”   Samumed has backers who aren’t traditional     investors, including    individuals and sovereign   funds. Finian Tan, whose firm Vickers Venture Partners is the   only VC to fund Samumed,  that he expected his investment to pay off   even more than his early investment in Chinese tech giant Baidu. ” ’   ”I’ve always been radical,” he told Bloomberg. ”For us, it’s all   about home runs. ” ’ ”   The lack of   healthcare specialist investors has led to   some skepticism, along with comparisons to   company   Theranos, which  and had a $9 billion valuation before The   Wall Street Journal published  that questioned the accuracy of Theranos’   blood test and led to its . ” ’   Samumed is also keeping the   of how it is able to   apply its WNT technology close to its chest, and that . ’ ’   ”To summarize our secretiveness, we don’’t disclose our targets,   we don’’t disclose our chemical structures,” Kibar said. When it   comes to data, the company is big on presenting at conferences   and plans to publish   trials in academic journals. ’ ’   ”We’’re basically telling everyone, here’’s proof that it works,”   Kibar said. ”How it works  —   you just need to wait a   little longer, because we want to build as much a head start as   we can.” ’ ’   The key difference is that Samumed is being public about its   data. It presents at medical conferences, where it gets     as part of the vetting process, Kibar said. And   before it gets on the market, it will have to be approved by the   FDA. ’ ’   ”Ultimately, we will live or die with the strength of our data,”   Kibar said. ”Because we are in the business of therapeutics, we   don’’t have the luxury of not sharing data with the regulatory   agencies.” ’ ’  ’ ”   Samumed’s   treatments are in   trials,   which means there is still a ways to go before the treatments can   be evaluated by the FDA. If one or more of the company’s   treatments can be approved, it would be a big deal for   regenerative medicine, not to mention the promise of antiaging   treatments. ” ”   In the past few years, there’s been a fair amount of interest in   companies like Samumed that are trying to treat diseases of   aging. ” ’   Unity Biotechnology, which is working on treatments that act on    (cells that have permanently stopped dividing   that have been linked to conditions as varied as  and )  from investors including   Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. ’ ’   In 2013, Google founded Calico, a biotechnology company devoted   to learning how to extend the human lifespan. ’ ”   And over the past few decades, researchers have made strides to   understanding more about stem cells and regeneration. There have   been a  and there’s no guarantee this new wave of   companies won’t fail as well. Still, researchers are optimistic. ” ’   ”If you hit any one of these, you’’re going to be helping   literally tens of millions of people,” ’ ’   Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientific officer at Astellas Institute   of Regenerative Medicine, told Business Insider. ’ ’   Astellas is working on treatments for blindness using stem cells.   To make that or other treatments a reality, Lanza is pulling   together leaders and scientists in the     world to stack the deck in his favor. ”We’’re in a good   position to make a difference,” he said. ’ ”   Ned David, president of Unity, told Business Insider that he   found Samumed’s approach thoughtful. Like Samumed’s work on the   WNT pathway, treatments that remove senescent cells are still in   the experimental stages. ” ’   ”The tragedy for either one of those biologies would be that you   picked an indication, eggs in one basket, bet everything on red.   Then you flip the data card, you flip the wrong patients, chose   the wrong molecule, or didn’’t dose right, and the whole company   dies and the science is set back a decade,” David said. ”That’’s a   social tragedy.” ’ ’   So that way, if you spread everything out, go after really   different drugs, your odds go up, the thinking goes. ’ ’   ”If you bet everything on red, the chance it works is way less   than a coin flip. And if you got two, the chance that either of   those work is still less than a coin flip. Three, you’’re starting   to look   level,” David said. ”That’’s something I can get   my head around.” ’ ’Samumed is a $12 billion private biotech. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
