’  ’ ’   College affordability has recently become the preeminent issue in   higher education, as   figures have hit staggering   levels. ’ ’   But most conversations center on  rather than a less     expense that strains the wallets of college students: textbooks. ’ ’   Since 1977, the price of college textbooks has more than tripled   the rate of inflation, meaning a 1, 041% rise,  which cites Bureau of Labor Statistics   Data. ’ ’   ”They’’ve been able to keep raising prices because students are   ’’captive consumers. ’’ They have to buy whatever books they’’re   assigned,” Nicole Allen, a spokeswoman for the Scholarly   Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, told NBC. ’ ’   Some publishers contest the idea that textbook prices have risen   exorbitantly, claiming that what may look like stark increases in   percentages actually represent more modest increases in whole   dollars. ’ ’  ’ ’   Still, students and experts following the trend say that the   prices are becoming prohibitively expensive. ’ ’   And the high prices are beginning to discourage some students   from purchasing textbooks for their classes, despite the fact   that they realize it may hurt their grades. ’ ’   The US Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG)  across   33 states and found that 65% of students decided against buying a   book required for class due to its high cost. And 94% of those   students acknowledged that they were afraid that the move would   hurt their grade. ’ ’   ”The textbooks market is broken and students are paying the   price,” Ethan Senack, a   associate at US PIRG,    in 2014. ’ ’   ”[Students] can’’t shop around and find the most affordable   option, meaning there’’s no consumer control on the market,”   Senack said. ’ ’   They can, however, mitigate the rising cost of textbooks by   looking for alternatives, such as buying used books and selling   their books after the course has come to an end. ’
