Pop star Justin Bieber got into a scuffle with an eager fan while on his way to a performance in Barcelona on Tuesday, leaving the fan with a bloody mouth and a story to tell for years to come to his fellow Beliebers. [The    heartthrob was being driven to a concert in the Spanish city Tuesday when a male fan reached through the rear window of the car he was riding in.  Video obtained by TMZ shows Bieber wasn’t having it. A hand quickly shoots out the window and catches the young fan in the face.  “He just punched me,” the apparently stunned fan told his friends in Spanish. According to the Mirror, Spanish authorities are not actively investigating the incident. Bieber has been involved in altercations like this before, but the young pop star is usually on the receiving end. In June, he was socked in the face by a much bigger guy in Cleveland after Game 3 of the NBA Finals, and in June of 2014, he was able to narrowly avoid being hit by actor Orlando Bloom at a restaurant in Ibiza. The singer is in Spain to continue his Purpose World Tour. He is set to play a concert in Madrid Wednesday night before leaving for Portugal and the United Kingdom and then heading back to Miami Beach for a New Year’s Eve show.
