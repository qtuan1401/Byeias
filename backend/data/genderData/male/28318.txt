President Obama will commute the sentences of 61 additional drug offenders serving prison time. [The White House announced the president’s decision this morning as well as the news that he plans to meet with former drug offenders who have also had their sentences commuted.  The offenders have been sentenced to prison for attempts to distribute and to possess cocaine, meth, heroin, PCP, and other drugs. Twelve of the commuted sentences were also convicted of firearm related offenses. Obama commuted the sentences of 68 drug offenders in 2015, making drug sentencing reform a priority for his administration. All told, Obama has commuted the sentences of 248 individuals —   more than the previous six presidents combined, according to the White House, “The power to grant pardons and commutations  …     embodies the basic belief in our democracy that people deserve a second chance after having made a mistake in their lives that led to a conviction under our laws,” Obama said in his pardon letter. He also visited   drug offenders in prison in 2015 to call for more sentencing reform. “That’s what strikes me, there but for the grace of God,” Obama said during the visit. “And that is something that we all have to think about. ” Yesterday, Obama admitted that although he used illegal drugs as a young person, he was “lucky” that he didn’t end up in prison or helplessly addicted. “I was lucky. I don’t know why,” he said. “Friends of mine who ended up battling addiction were not less worthy or more morally suspect than I was. For whatever reason, things broke that way. ” The President granted commutations of sentence to the following 61 individuals: · Henry Claude Agnew  —   Miami, FLOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base Southern District of FloridaSentence: 262 months’ imprisonment five years’ supervised release (November 24, 2003) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016. · David Lang Akana  —   Pahala, HIOffense: Conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and cocaine attempt to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine attempt to possess with intent to distribute cocaine possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine District of HawaiiSentence: 240 months’ imprisonment 10 years’ supervised release (February 15, 2006) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016. · Robert Anthony Anderson  —   Louisville, KYOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine attempt to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, aiding and abetting Western District of KentuckySentence: Life imprisonment (August 8, 1994) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on March 30, 2017. · Marvin Bailey  —   Hollywood, FLOffense: Conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base aiding the travel in interstate commerce to promote the distribution of cocaine possession with intent to distribute cocaine Southern District of West VirginiaSentence: Life imprisonment $25, 000 fine (June 19, 1997) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on March 30, 2017, and unpaid balance of the $25, 000 fine remitted. · Bernard Beard  —   Compton, CAOffense: Conspiracy to distribute cocaine, cocaine base, heroin, and phencyclidine (PCP) felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition Central District of CaliforniaSentence: 240 months’ imprisonment five years’ supervised release (May 22, 2009) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016. · Reginald Wendell Boyd, Jr.  —   Greensboro, NCOffense: Conspiracy to distribute cocaine hydrochloride carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime Middle District of North CarolinaSentence: 180 months’ imprisonment eight years’ supervised release (October 31, 2005) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016. · Carmel Bretous  —   Miami, FLOffense: Conspiracy to import at least five kilograms of cocaine importation of five kilograms of cocaine conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine possession with intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine Southern District of FloridaSentence: 235 months’ imprisonment five years’ supervised release (November 6, 2001) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016. · Terry Brown  —   St. Louis, MOOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and phencyclidine (PCP) Eastern District of MissouriSentence: 240 months’ imprisonment 10 years’ supervised release (July 7, 2005) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016. · Willie Chevell Cameron  —   Panama City Beach, FLOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, a mixture and substance containing cocaine, more than 50 grams of methamphetamine (actual) and more than 50 grams of a mixture and substance containing methamphetamine Northern District of FloridaSentence: Life imprisonment 10 years’ supervised release (June 14, 2006) Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2016. · Nathan Carter  —   Memphis, TNOffense: 1.
