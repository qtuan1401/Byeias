’  ’ ’     Pokémon Go may have much of the country obsessed, but players     need to be careful, because criminals are using the popular app     to easily .   ’ ’     Police in O’Fallon, Missouri say they are investigating a     series of armed robberies  in which players of the augmented reality game     were the victims.   ’ ’     Police put out the warning on Facebook after they located four     teenagers, who ranged in age from 16 to 18, inside a car with a     handgun when they were answering a call about an armed robbery     early Sunday morning.   ’ ’     They say the suspects appeared to use the app to lure players     to an isolated location and then rob them. Authorities believe     the four teenagers had robbed      over the past few days.   ’ ’     ”The way we believe it was used is you can add a beacon to a     pokestop to lure more players. Apparently they were using the     app to locate ppl standing around in the middle of a parking     lot or whatever other location they were in,” according to a     press release the O’Fallon, Missouri police department .   ’ ’ ’
