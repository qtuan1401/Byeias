‘ ’ and so called ‘ ’ groups have clashed in Dover today, as both are staging simultaneous protests in the Kent coastal town. Labour MP Diane Abbott has attended the demonstration, joining forces with communists and socialists from across Europe in calling for open borders. [The event was originally planned as a rally to ‘Support the Dover to Calais Truckers,’ following numerous reports of cross continental drivers being attacked passing through the French port. However, the rally was seized on by numerous right and left wing groups. The Kent   network, joined by supporters from across the country including gay rights activists, marched through the town this morning, starting in Market Square at 11am. Right wing groups were due to march in a   at 2pm from Dover Priory rail station.  However the two groups had already clashed, with one altercation taking place at a service station on the M20 outside Maidstone, forcing the facility to close.   of both groups pulled into the services and attacked each other’s coaches. Windows were smashed and a swastika was daubed on the  ’ bus. UPDATE: Pictures show carnage at junction 8 as coaches are smashed.

They were wearing Combat 18   and one had an Enoch Powell  . “They were running at the   demonstrators and there was some   things were chucked back and forth. And then the   went back to their coaches and the group of fascists basically tooled up with bits of wood and bins. “They attacked one of our coaches and smashed up the windows and one of them came and daubed a swastika in blood on the side of one of the coaches. ” Inside the town the left wing protestors chanted “Nazi scum off our streets” some dressed in black with their faces obscured. Missiles were also thrown at the   protestors, apparently by locals who are sympathetic to the left wing protestors. @KentAntiRacism #Dover #antifa pic. twitter.   —   RJ udunno (@righteousxRJ) January 30, 2016,  Happening now: #Antifa demo against #NeoNazi protest in #Dover.

A spokesman for Kent Police said beforehand: “Extra officers will be in Dover to facilitate a peaceful protest and minimise disruption to the community. “The policing plan to based on an assessment of all known information and will be proportionate to any of the risks identified. ” #UK police lined up to cut off #antifa protesters in #Dover. #antinaziGr pic. twitter.   —   th anonymous (@ori_no_co) January 30, 2016,  police thought they had us kettled #EpicFail.

Addressing the crowd, she told the protestors: “migrants have helped build this country   …     we cannot let the fascists divide us!” However, her presence was criticised by some on social media who called her a hypocrite.

Next Saturday will see the first march by Pegida UK, in Birmingham. The rally is being held on the same day as Pegida groups across Europe march against the creeping Islamisation of Europe and in protest against open doors migration policies. However they are likely to be heavily opposed by left wing ‘ ’ groups.
