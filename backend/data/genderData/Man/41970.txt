 (CNN) He made her want to say ”I do!” Singer Colbie Caillat announced on social media Friday that she’s engaged to longtime boyfriend and musician Justin Young. ”This sweet man asked me to be his lobster . .. and I said yes,” she said in an image posted on her Facebook and Instagram accounts. Young is Caillat’s lead guitarist and musical director. The two became an item in 2009 while touring, she told Billboard in 2011.  She was promoting her 2011 album, ”All of You,” which included the hit single is ”I Do.” She insisted, though, that the song was not necessarily about marriage. ”(The song) is about being in love and taking your relationship to the next level, but if people want to use it as their wedding songs or think it is about marriage, then they can go right ahead,” she told the magazine. Young popped the question in Bermuda, where she was celebrating her 30th birthday. Her followers might have picked up on the news a day earlier when she posted a picture of herself with a shiny bauble on her left ring finger.
