At a Politico event on Thursday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the possibility of President Barack Obama issuing a pardon for   DREAMers, illegal immigrants brought to the country as a minor, before he leaves office next month.  According to Lynch, no framework exists for such an “en masse” pardon. So the question before me is whether or not there can be pardons, a pardon of a group of people, the DREAMers. The young people who came here, are working here, are going to school here, are contributing to our society as every immigrant group has done since the beginning of this country. And as I said then the issue of pardoning someone is an individual decision that is made on a    basis. So, there is no framework or regulatory framework that allows for a pardon for a group en masse. (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
