Tuesday, while announcing several executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence President Barack Obama took aim at GOP candidates that questioned the motives behind Obama’s actions.  Obama said, “Contrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this hasn’t been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation. Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates apparently before this meeting, this is not a plot to take away everybody’s guns. You pass a background check, you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the internet with no background check, no questions asked. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
