’  ’ ’   A UFC press conference descended into chaos on Wednesday when two   fighters got into a shouting match that led to water bottles   being thrown across the room. ’ ’   The altercation between Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz happened   during a press conference ahead of their bout at UFC 202, which   is scheduled for Saturday. ’ ’   While Diaz and his entourage were walking out of the media event,   Diaz could be heard shouting at McGregor, who was speaking to   journalists from a table on the stage. ’ ’   ”Hey,     your whole team, how about that?” Diaz said. ’ ’   ”You’’ll do nothing. Shut your     mouth,” McGregor responded. ’ ’   ”You’’ll do nothing. You’’ll do     nothing. Not one of you   will do nothing. Get the     out of here,” an incensed McGregor   added before throwing several water bottles at his UFC opponent. ’ ’   McGregor is the UFC Featherweight Champion. ’ ’   UFC President Dana White was visibly disappointed after he tried   to stop McGregor from hurling bottles at Diaz. ’ ’   ”Sorry guys. See you Saturday,” White said, abruptly ending the   press conference after the squabble. ’ ”   It’s not unusual for professional fighters to engage in a bit of   showy bravado before a match: It’s a tradition that stretches   back to the early days of boxing. ” ’ ’
