 (CNN) Here’s a look at the International Criminal Court, a court comprised of 124 states from around the world.  Facts:Although created by the Rome Statute, a treaty first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates as an independent entity.  The Court is located in The Hague, Netherlands.  The ICC is the ”court of last resort,” committed after July 1, 2002. The Court tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. It is not intended to replace a national justice system.  Currently, 139 states are signatories but only 124 are considered parties to the treaty. The United States is a signatory to the treaty, but not a party.  Cases are referred to the court by national governments or the United Nations Security Council.  The 18 judges serve nine year terms.  July 17, 1998   The Rome Statute is adopted by 120 states, informally establishing the permanent International Criminal Court. Seven members of the UN vote against the statute: the United States, China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar and Yemen.  July 1, 2002   The Rome Statute enters into force after ratification by 60 countries.  October 12, 2016   Burundi votes to withdraw from the ICC, but is still listed as a party.  October 21, 2016   South Africa notifies the UN it is withdrawing from the ICC, saying parts of the Rome statute conflict with the country’s own laws which give    particularly ones they’re trying to reach peace and stability with, diplomatic immunity.    October 26, 2016   Gambia announces it is withdrawing from the court, citing bias against Africans.  November 16, 2016   Russia says it will withdraw from the ICC under a directive signed by President Vladimir Putin.
