Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton insists there is no criminal case to be made regarding her use of a private email server, just days after FBI director James Comey informed Congress that the agency was revisiting the investigation. [“There is no case here,” Clinton said during a speech in Kent, Ohio on Monday.  Clinton opened her rally referring to the investigation, which prompted her supporters to boo Comey. “I am sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go,” she said. “That is a good question. ” Clinton told supporters she had already apologized for using her personal email in the State Department. She revealed that the FBI wanted to look through the emails of “one of her staffers” but did not mention Huma Abedin or Anthony Weiner in her remarks. Clinton said, “by all means” the FBI should examine the new emails, but said it was likely that the FBI would come to the same conclusion they made in July. “They said it wasn’t even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all this,” she said.
