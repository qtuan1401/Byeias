In the wake of “gunpocalypse,” Second Amendment supporters in California are vowing civil disobedience: “Come and take it. ”[Governor Jerry Brown signed six of the 11 new gun control bills that passed the California legislature last week, including a ban on “the sale of semiautomatic rifles equipped with bullet buttons. ”  Bullet buttons are simple mechanisms that allow a gun owner to switch out an empty magazine for a full one. In addition to the ban on the sale of such rifles, Brown also signed bills that will require   citizens to go through a background check before being allowed to buy ammunition. After signing the bills, Brown released a statement, saying, “My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of   gun owners. ” Senate President Kevin de Léon (  Angeles) praised the new laws, according to the Orange County Register: “Taken together, these bills will save lives and make our communities, our families and our children safer,” de Leon said in an email. “Where Republicans in Congress have turned a deaf ear, we have answered the cries of the mothers, fathers, family members and friends who have lost loved ones to gun violence. ” But many   gun owners do not see how the Second Amendment is protected by more gun control. In fact, gun owners rallied near Sacramento’s Cesar Chavez Plaza on Saturday morning to to say the new controls simply turn “  citizens into criminals. ” For that reason, they have no plans to obey. According to the Sacramento Bee, the protesters held banners which proclaimed, “WE WILL NOT COMPLY. ” Corey Gwathney helped organize the rally. He said, “They’re infringing on our rights, and we’re not going to stand for that. ”   AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
