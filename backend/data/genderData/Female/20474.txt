When asked about Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly’s recent negative comments regarding National Review Online, including its   issue, current Eagle Forum president Ed Martin called NRO “a joke” and predicted it “will be defunct in the next year or so, after failing to connect with conservative readers. ”[Said Martin, people “are getting information everyday, they’re moving, they’re jumping everyday and the last thing they want is to be lectured by some       insider, whether they are in D. C. or not, who are going to say, we know better than you. People are finding out stuff (for themselves) by going to  sites like yours and others. ”  “Conservatives are sick of being lectured by authority   …     the authority that gave us trillion dollars of debt, people getting killed in wars we refused to win, a military that’s being gutted by social experimentation,” Martin went on. “The NRO is comical,” added Martin. “They converted themselves to a 501c because they can’t make any money as a magazine. This is like a death rattle. ” The entire audio of Martin’s scathing  —   and many believe absolutely valid  —   attack on NRO can be heard below.
