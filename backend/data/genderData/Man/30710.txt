Former Democratic National Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has announced that she will not gavel in the Democratic convention in Philadelphia today. [“I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention,” Wasserman Schultz said in an interview with the Florida Sun Sentinel.  Wasserman Schultz announced she would step down from her position as chairman of the DNC on Sunday, after leaked emails from the committee showed that staffers openly criticized Hillary Clinton’s opponent Bernie Sanders. Washerman Schultz said she stepped down because she wanted to avoid distractions from the convention nominating Clinton as their presidential nominee. On Monday, Wasserman Schultz’s speech to the Florida delegation was met with boos from angry protesters, making it difficult for her to speak.
