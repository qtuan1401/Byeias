”We have a process set up that is eminently fair”    DNC chair @DWStweets on @NewDay https:  .  Wednesday on CNN’s “New Day,” Democratic National Committee chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) reacted to news that Nevada State Democratic chairwoman Roberta Lange had been harassed by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ ( ) presidential campaign who have alleged the process of delegate allotment has been unfair.  Lange had reportedly received death threats and other harassing communications. Still, Wasserman Schultz insisted the process was “eminently fair” and that any responses from any candidates’ supporters should be civil. “We have a process set up that is eminently fair,” she said. “And it is not responsible every time a fair process that follows rules we’ve had in place for many years  —   the same rules that resulted in Barack Obama’s nomination and frankly we had a credentials committee that establishes those rules at the Nevada Democratic Party that was evenly split between Sanders supporters and Clinton supporters. But regardless Chris, it is critical that we as candidates, we as Democratic Party leaders, everyone involved needs to make sure that we can take all the steps that we need to ensure that the process is not only run smoothly, but that the response from the supporters from both candidates is appropriate and civil. No one should be subjected to death threats. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
