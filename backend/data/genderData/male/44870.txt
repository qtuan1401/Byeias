’  ’ ’   Damien Mander removes his hat to cover his nose, an act of   instinct and ceremony that does little to temper the thick stench   of death. ’ ’   The cloudless sky is empty of vultures on this scorching   Mozambique morning, and as Mander approaches the kill site, an   orchestra of heavy wing beats reveals why. Scores of the   scavengers have settled onto comfortable perches, frosted in days   of bird shit and molt, for a macabre feast: two dead rhinos,   mother and calf. ’ ’   “The last minutes of their lives would’ve been bloody   terrifying,” says Mander, 37, the founder of the International     Foundation (IAPF) a   organization   dedicated to providing Africa’s wildlife rangers with     training, management, and resources. A former     sniper who spent six years in the Australian   military, followed by 12 tours in Iraq as a private contractor,   Mander is now embroiled in Africa’s most volatile wildlife war. ’ ’   The ridgeline where he stands represents perhaps the most   critical strip of territory on the planet for rhinoceros   conservation. To the west lies South Africa’s famed Kruger   National Park, home to more than 8, 000 rhinos, roughly     of the continent’s remaining population. To the east is Sabie   Game Park, one of nine private borderland reserves that compose   the    Greater Lembobo Conservancy in Mozambique,   among the world’s poorest countries and home to sophisticated   poaching syndicates that haunt Kruger and are hunting rhinos   toward extinction. ’ ’   Three nights prior, this rhino pair and two young bulls were just   a quartet of peaceful grazers snacking their way along a narrow   creek bed, oblivious to international borders and the bounty that   an insatiable black market has placed, quite literally, on their   head. Then, under a   moon, two poachers tracked the   herd through the thorn scrub, took aim with a . 375 hunting rifle,   and fired. The mother went down with three shots, the calf with a   fourth. ’ ”   Mander, standing a hulking 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighing 240   pounds, slowly approaches the mother, lying on her side on a   gentle slope overlooking the savanna. A giant crater rots where   her    horn once grew. Machete wounds run up her back   and across her hind legs. She was still alive when the poachers   went to work. They cut her spinal cord and tendons in her legs to   immobilize her, before carving out her horn. Scavengers made   quick work of the carcass once the poachers left, rendering this     megaherbivore to little more than leather. Next to her lies   her calf, deflated like a popped balloon and bearing matching   wounds and missing horns. “It’s shattering,” says Mander. “It’s   like you’ve been given something very important to take care of   and someone’s come and taken that away. ” ” ’   Rhinos are under siege. In just 10 years, the average number   poached annually in South Africa —  home to some 20, 000   animals —  jumped from 17 to more than 1, 000. East Asian demand for   rhino horn as a cure for everything from hangovers to cancer is   so high, it now fetches an estimated $20, 000 per pound —  despite   the fact that it’s made of the same keratin found in human   fingernails and has no proven medical benefits. Its illegal trade   has exploded into a sprawling global battlefield of sophisticated   crime organizations, heavy arms, murder, and corruption. The   front lines,   savannas and woodlands where rhinos   wander, have become a war zone. ’ ’  ’ ’   Mander launched the IAPF in 2009 with a vision to create what he   describes as “the special forces of conservation. ” The   organization is currently managing or assisting security   operations in eight parks across southern Africa and, later this   year, will launch a     leadership college   designed to train the next generation of wildlife rangers. Over   10 days in January, I traveled with Mander across southern Africa   to get a firsthand look. ’ ’   Since 2015, the IAPF’s efforts at Sabie have translated into an   expansion of the park’s existing security team, implementation of   a training and leadership program, and funding for everything   from shoes and socks to aircraft to   units. There have been   early signs of success in the   park: namely, rhinos. ’ ’   In 2013, rhino poaching in Mozambique had gotten so bad that   government wildlife officials were publicly debating whether or   not the animals had gone extinct in the country. “As soon as   rhinos would cross [from Kruger into Sabie],” recalls     manager Sean van Niekerk, “they’d get shot. ” If   Sabie rangers found a live rhino in the park, they’d try to chase   it back to Kruger. Today, the reserve has a relatively stable   resident population. That same year, South Africa National Parks   estimated that 75 percent of Kruger’s poachers entered the park   through Mozambique; in 2016, that number dropped to 30 percent.   General Johan Jooste, the head of special projects at South   Africa National Parks, says the IAPF’s efforts have played a   “significant role” in the shift. “The numbers speak for   themselves. ” ’ ’   And still, 2017 was off to a rough start, for both rhinos and   rangers. The helicopter and   aircraft were down for   repairs, and the   unit was on a training course. Then it   rained, 8 inches in just four weeks, more precipitation than the   area had received the entire previous year. The dirt roads the   rangers use for patrol had turned to thick black cotton capable   of swallowing a truck to the axle, making driving the     fence line impossible. Poachers slipped in and out, killing four   rhinos in eight days —  one less than in all of 2016. “It shows you   how quickly things can turn out here,” says Mander. ’ ’   Mander represents an unlikely, if increasingly important, brand   of conservationist: He’s a military man, drawing lessons from   what he sees as a failed desert war to protect an iconic   endangered species; a mercenary who’s invested his spoils into a     fighting an African battle that can never definitively   be won, but can very easily be lost. ’ ”   At the crime scene, the smell of the carcasses continues to   ripen, pleasing none but the vultures. The sun climbs toward high   noon and we make a dour retreat back to the truck. Mander offers   resolve in florid Australian sprachgefühl. “We’ve just got to get   up, get back out there, protect the next lot of rhino, and   fucking stop these pricks. ” ” ’   It is a sad and infuriating reality that one of the biggest   threats to the existence of any single species of animal is how   widely it is admired by humans. Naturally one might assume that   the greater esteem a species enjoyed, the more protection it   would receive, but rarely is this a proportional equation. Much   better to be ignored. Just ask the rhinoceros. ’ ’  ’ ’   Thirty thousand years ago, rhinos were celebrated in cave   paintings in what is now modern day France —  right before they were   driven to extinction on the continent, probably by weapons made   of their own horn. The Chinese revered the rhino for its power   and longevity and, as author Richard Ellis noted, considered it a   “walking apothecary. ” They used its hide to make suits of armor   and its horn as a treatment to neutralize poison and cure   illness. By the time of the Han Dynasty (600 —  900 A. D.) China had   to import the horn of the   pachyderm. ’ ’   Ernest Hemingway described the black rhino with reverence in   Green Hills of Africa as “         …    [with] hide like vulcanized rubber  …    a hell of   an animal. ” Like the colonial hunters who began emptying Africa   of its large game centuries ago, Hemingway’s intimate knowledge   of the rhino sprang from his penchant for shooting them. The   Yemeni have no particular reverence for the animal itself, as its   modern range has never extended to the southern edge of the   Arabian Peninsula. Nonetheless they have been voracious consumers   of the great rhino phallus, carving horns into handles for their   own decorative phalluses, traditional daggers called jambiyas.   It’s the kind of rare,   synergy the United Nations   might envy if the end results weren’t so tragic: African, Asian,   Muslim, and Western societies working in concert, to push rhinos   to the brink. ’ ’   Today, five species of rhino survive, all in varying states of   peril. During colonial times Javan and Sumatran rhinos   (Rhinoceros sondaicus and Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, respectively)   were common enough to be considered pests to tea growers. All   that remains of the former is a single population of 63 on the   island of Java, while fewer than 100 of the latter live in small   pockets on Sumatra and Kalimantan. The greater   rhino   (Rhinoceros unicornis) is faring slightly better, with a   population of 3, 500 split between India and Nepal —  up from just   600 in 1975. In 1960, an estimated 100, 000 black rhinos (Diceros   bicornis) roamed across Africa, compared to 5, 000 today. For the   time being at least, the white rhino (Ceratotherium simum)   represents one of the great conservation stories. By the late   19th century, colonial hunters were thought to have driven the   species to extinction until a remnant population of as few as 50   animals was discovered in South Africa. From that modest group   sprang the 20, 000 white rhinos alive today. ’ ’   Rhinos serve as an umbrella species. Demand for their horn is so   fierce, the thinking goes, that curbing rhino poaching will   reduce the poaching of other animals as well. But it’s a   constant, exhausting battle. “We have to be right 100 percent of   the time,” says Mander. “The poachers only need to be right   once. ” ’ ’  ’ ’   Fighting has always come naturally to Mander. As a baby, his   mother Karin recalls of her first born, the adversary was sleep.   “He would not nap, ever, as if he didn’t want to miss anything. ”   He grew up in Mornington, a quaint        35 miles south of   Melbourne, Australia. In middle school, when other kids were   playing with firecrackers, Mander taught himself to build and   detonate petrol bombs in the backyard. He started a hustle     for squid lures that fishermen lost off the local   pier, and then selling them back for five bucks a pop. The water   got cold, 55 degrees, and Mander’s   wetsuit offered   barely more insulation than a  . He’d stay in the water for   hours. “Looking back,” he recalls, “it was the best training I   could have done to be a Navy diver. ” ’ ’   In high school he was a champion discus thrower and star   Australian Rules Football fullback. He threw his weight around on   the pitch, but also learned that the best fights are those won   without throwing a punch. One night, an    Mander was   shooting pool when his opponent, an even larger specimen, took   exception to the fact that he was losing to a cocksure teenager.   Words were exchanged. The big guy grabbed his pool cue as if   preparing to play cricket with Mander’s skull. Mander picked up   his pint glass, chugged his beer  …     and ate the pint glass. ’ ’   “He was just staring this guy dead in the eye, chewing his   glass,” recalls his gobsmacked friend Brent Loughrey. “He wasn’t   bleeding or anything. That ended that   pretty quickly. ” ’ ’   “The secret,” Mander explains, “is to spit, not swallow. ” ’ ’   With narrow set eyes and a sharp nose, he looks a bit like   Eminem —  if Eminem played middle linebacker for the Pittsburgh   Steelers. His body is a gallery of tattooed aggression. On his   right shoulder, The Incredible Hulk bashes through a brick wall.   An H. R.   image covers his   back, demons   peeling away flayed skin to reveal a cyborg skeleton. Arcing from   collarbone to collarbone, in Gothic,   font, is the mantra   of his formative years: “SEEK & DESTROY. ” ’ ’   “That one worried me a little,” says Karin. “I didn’t know what   it would attract. ” ’ ’   At 19, working as a garbage man and running with a crew that   ended up behind bars, Mander followed the path of many a   rudderless teen, into the Navy. He enlisted as an electronics   technician and quickly advanced to clearance diver, specializing   in underwater demolitions, ordnance disposal, and maritime    . When Australia expanded its Tactical Assault   Group, an elite   unit comparable to the U. S. Navy   SEALs, following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Mander   jumped at the opportunity. ’ ’   The diver was a fish out of water. The training ground and   punishing skill set —  urban warfare,   combat,   sniping —  had little overlap with his maritime expertise. He earned   the nickname Agent Orange, after the defoliant, because of his   tendency to leave a trail of crushed vegetation during stalking   exercises. “For a Navy diver,” says Mander’s former commanding   officer Col. Brett Chaloner, who now serves on the IAPF’s board,   “the learning curve couldn’t have been steeper. ” ’ ’   After six years studying warcraft on domestic soil, Mander left   the Navy in 2005 and went to Iraq as a soldier of fortune. “I   wanted to get some dirt on my knees,” he says. The reality of the   war hit hard. He took assignments of the   variety   but even those left him disillusioned. Tasked with training Iraqi   police and other security forces, he found that the program   stressed quantity over quality. “I was responsible for the death   of a lot of Iraqis,” he says. “We were given six weeks to   recruit, train, and deploy Iraqis back out onto the front line   and that’s not enough time. The government was happy, because   they got to put the big figures down saying how many people had   been deployed, but [the trainees] either got killed, they   deserted, or they joined the insurgency and fought back against   the coalition. ” ’ ’   Three years and 12 tours later, Mander was wasted. He’d banked   enough money to buy eight residential investment properties and   thought he’d escaped Iraq unscathed. The wounds didn’t appear   until he returned home. “For a lot of guys,” Mander reflects,   “the war doesn’t start until the bullets stop. You get home and   you don’t know how to reintegrate into society. I was one of   them. I mean, what the fuck do I do? There’s no job for a sniper   in the local newspaper. ” ’ ’   In 2008, he went on a   bender in South America, which   only led to more emptiness. He’d lost direction, a drawn arrow   without a target. Then he heard about the   crisis   brewing in South Africa. It sounded like a war, a noble one.   Maybe, he thought, there was something he could do to help. ’ ’  ’ ’   With a sharp snap of his fingers, Senzani Tshabangu orders the   four other rangers to stop. We’re on foot patrol, it’s nearly   midnight, and a storm front has darkened the moon, two days past   full, under a carpet of clouds. A tree rustles 100 feet away. The   bush comes alive at night, and poachers are far from the only   danger out here.   One of the savanna’s more   and unpredictable animals   steps out of the shadows, a   cape buffalo. “Let’s just   wait for a moment,” whispers Tshabangu, 42, who’s all too   familiar with   and unpredictable animals. A few years   earlier, while he was fishing at a nearby reservoir, a crocodile   leapt from the water and grabbed his leg. Tshabangu managed to   liberate himself from the jaws of death, but the crocodile took   its pound of flesh in the form of his right thumb. Tonight, we   proceed with caution. “Maybe,” he says of the buffalo, “there is   another one in the bush. ” ’ ’   Tshabangu is one of a dozen IAPF rangers who safeguard the   Stanley and Livingston Private Game Reserve in Victoria Falls,   Zimbabwe. The reserve has one of the few populations of black   rhino in Zimbabwe, and a successful breeding program. The park   also serves as IAPF’s headquarters and is where Mander first   found a foothold in Africa. ’ ’   He arrived in Victoria Falls in 2009 and took up residence at a   backpackers’ hostel, sleeping on the floor of a      cinder block cabin. Every day he’d walk the railroad tracks, 8   miles each way, to volunteer at a small reserve doing ranger   training and security management. Ian Dupreez, the wildlife   manager at Stanley and Livingston, had heard of a tattooed,   oversized   sniper knocking around town, but didn’t   have high expectations. “I can’t tell you how many times these   guys come in and tell me they’re going to solve all my problems.   They never last. ” Dupreez did, however, have a small breeding   group of rhino, and knew his reserve had become a target. He paid   Mander a visit. ’ ’   “My first impression,” Dupreez discovered, “was totally wrong. He   was absolutely dedicated to this,” he says of Mander. “I brought   him onto the property and I’ve never had a regret doing that. ”   Mander offered to help Dupreez develop, execute, and resource a   security plan for the park; in exchange, Dupreez provided Mander   with a field laboratory to test, refine, and scale a program. ’ ’   What started as a fun adventure became Mander’s life’s calling.   He came to an inflection point one afternoon six months into his   stay, when he found a cape buffalo caught in a poacher’s snare.   The animal had struggled so hard to escape that she’d torn her   pelvis apart. It was a torturous death. When one of the rangers   offered mercy with a bullet to the head, the cow began to give   birth. ’ ”   “I’d finally reached a moral baseline of what I was willing to   walk away from,” says Mander. “Everything in my life up to that   point was more or less about me. I didn’t join the military to   serve my country. I didn’t go to Iraq to liberate the Iraqi   people. I did both of those things for adventure. I did it for   money. I did it for myself and I was a selfish prick. I thought   status was the job I held, and the houses I had, all the   bullshit. ” ” ’   Mander became a vegan. He sold five of the properties in   Australia and poured the money into the IAPF. He purchased a game   lodge and concession, and developed a   management plan for   Zimbabwe’s   jewel, Chizarria National Park. He   built a headquarters and ranger camp at Stanley and Livingston,   and helped expand the ranger and management team. “I wanted to   put some shitty skills to good use,” he says. ’ ’  ’ ’   Mander’s methods and objectives are not without critics or   controversy. In the big picture, says Keith Roberts, Conservation   International’s executive director for wildlife trafficking, the   IAPF is simply “not shifting the needle on the ground in any   sense. ” Poachers, Roberts asserts, are merely a symptom of the   problem, not the root of it. ’ ’   The only way rhinos, any wildlife, will be protected from   poaching in the long term is if the upstream issues —  economic   development in Africa, market demand in Asia, and corruption and   lack of political will just about everywhere —  are addressed.   Fighting poachers on the front lines may be an effective way to   protect specific parks over the short term but that’s akin to   plugging a leaky dam with your fingers. Poachers, like water,   follow a path of least resistance. ’ ’   The successes at Sabie illustrate the point. While the percentage   of poachers entering Kruger from Mozambique has dropped by more   than half over the past three years, South Africa continues to   lose more than 1, 000 rhinos annually. ’ ’   “What we do,” Mander readily admits, “is not the answer. I can   write down how to secure a park on the back of a bus ticket, but   if you can’t solve the social issues it’s not going to solve the   problem. Our job is to stop the hemorrhaging, to buy time. ” ’ ’   While the IAPF’s efforts at Stanley and Livingston had begun   showing results after three years of work, white guys with   military backgrounds pushing security agendas don’t exactly have   an inspired legacy in Africa. Some government officials viewed   Mander’s motives with suspicion. What was a     warfare specialist doing out there in the bush? Protecting   wildlife? Or building a private army? ’ ”   Mander’s precarious standing was put under further scrutiny when   The Age, an Australian newspaper, published an explosive report   in March 2012 claiming that a “secret squadron of Australian SAS   soldiers has been operating at large in Africa, performing work   normally done by spies, in an unannounced and possibly dangerous   expansion of Australia’s foreign military engagement. ” Zimbabwe   was reported among the targets. Mander, who had been out of the   military for the better part of a decade and was in Monaco on a   fundraising tour at the time, became collateral damage. He was   told he could face charges of espionage —  and potentially the death   penalty —  if he returned to Zimbabwe. After investing three years   of his life and his savings into the IAPF, he had been shut down. ” ’   ”Let’’s go see some live rhinos,” Mander growls to Sabie senior   ranger Adolph Botha, hardly masking his frustration, as we pile   into the truck and drive away from the crime scene where the   mother and calf lie. Mander’s only in Mozambique for a few days   and Botha, a wiry    South African, is eager to temper   the grizzly morning with a dash of good news. ’ ’   Earlier that day, with the air patrol operational again, the   rangers spotted one of the young bulls that had been with the two   rhinos the night they were killed. “He went up north and met up   with another   pair. He’s not a threat to the dominant   bull in the area,” Botha says, hoping the youngster will settle   in for a while. Nearby two other rangers had been tracking a pair   of young bulls since dawn. We head to a dry creek bed to deliver   them lunch. ’ ’   There never is a good time to face exile but Mander’s expulsion   from Zimbabwe turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Facing the   choice of either going back to Australia or doubling down,   Mander, his wife Maria, and their infant son Leo moved to   Nelspruit, South Africa, a gateway town to Kruger and launching   pad into Mozambique. There’s no shortage of endangered animals   facing existential threats in Africa, but the Greater Lembobo   Conservancy (GLC) —  that network of wildlife reserves in which   Sabie Game Park sits —  had spectacular potential for protection:   prime habitat the size of Luxemburg, abutting the world’s   greatest herds of rhino, in a region with a low human population   density. ’ ”   For two years, Mander worked with public and private stakeholders   in both Mozambique and South Africa to develop     security plans in the GLC —  all the while using those same   politicking skills to clear his name in Zimbabwe, where he and   the IAPF are reestablished today. Much of his enforcement   philosophy is influenced by the mistakes of Iraq, training too   many people, too quickly, in order to satisfy politically   motivated quotas. “You cannot expect to deal with the types of   problems we’re facing by taking shortcuts,” he says. ” ’   The rhinos had just wrapped an afternoon mud bath and disappeared   into the shade of the underbrush by the time Mander, Botha, and I   arrive with lunch for the rangers. Botha kneels down to pick up   their tracks and spots the faintest of ridgelines in the soft   dust, the outer edge of a rhino’s back foot. He follows the   tracks through a thick patch of acacia, squeezing between the   thorns like he’s playing vertical limbo. The rain has brought the   bush to life and the acacia are pregnant with flowers, tiny   yellow balls swollen like sponges. ’ ’   Botha snaps his fingers and points. A hundred yards away, a   spectacular proboscis pokes into a clearing, attached to a     pickup truck the color of a dull quarter. The rhino   is so big, somehow even his shadow has mass. His vision is poor   and he hasn’t caught our scent, but his    ears   swivel around trying to pick up a signal. Satisfied that the   coast is clear, he continues into the open followed by a second   bull, traveling tail to horn. The trick to tracking them, Botha   whispers, is to stay close enough to keep tabs but far enough to   avoid spooking them. Otherwise they run, either away from you, in     heat, or at you, in which case the temperature becomes   irrelevant. Either way, no one wants a chase. ’ ’   Botha, Mander, and I settle into the shade of a marula tree   (Sclerocarya birrea) for some rhino watching. When they’re not   being pursued by murderous criminals toting     weaponry, the life of these rhinos looks pretty relaxing. Every   so often the flick of an ear or a tail reveals some minor,     perturbation, but the fresh carpet of grass offers   them a welcome distraction. Eventually they wander off and the   rangers, sufficiently lunched themselves, wander off with them. ’ ’   Despite the threats they face, these two white rhinos represent   success. A century ago, their species was on the brink of   extinction. Five years ago, they’d have been lucky to survive a   week wandering the Mozambique wilds. And yet, here they are.   Mander is determined to see a world where rhinos roam safe and   free. “We didn’t come here to lose,” he says, rising to his feet   and dusting himself off. He climbs back into the truck and drives   the bumpy road to headquarters. There’s a security briefing at   1600 hours. ’ ’ This story originally appeared in    an online magazine featuring beautiful and surprising stories   about nature and sustainability. ’ ’Damien Mander removes his hat to cover his. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
