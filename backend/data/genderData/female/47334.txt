’’ ”Imagine if you owned a    luxury home with the ability to fly you and 39 of your closest friends to anywhere you want in less than 17 hours. Next month, China’s HNA Aviation Group will take delivery of a new Boeing   private jet. As configured, the 787  has a range of almost 9, 800 miles even when packed with 40 passengers, luggage, and fuel.” ’With a flying time of about 17 hours, the plane can reach virtually any destination on earth, Kestrel Aviation Management CEO Stephen Vella told Business Insider. From start to finish, the aviation consulting firm,  oversaw the creation of this 787.’ ”Although several 787s have been converted from passenger service to private use, this is the first Dreamliner to be built specifically as a BBJ, Vella said. It is the 143rd Dreamliner to roll out of Boeing’s factory and first flew in December 2013. The plane was delivered to Kestrel in January 2014.”
