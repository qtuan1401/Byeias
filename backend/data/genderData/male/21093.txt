From an AFP story in the News Republic: Leftist Prime Minister Robert Fico won Slovakia’s general elections on Saturday on the back of a strident   platform, but lost his parliamentary majority as a scattering of smaller parties including the extreme right won seats, according to exit polls. A conservative leader described the outcome as a “big earthquake” in Slovak politics, and analysts cautioned that Fico would need to work hard to woo two or three parties to build a governing coalition. An exit poll by the private Markiza TV station showed his   Democrats ( ) party taking 27. 3 percent (45 seats) of the vote, meaning Fico lost his   majority in parliament, which has 150 members. This was followed by the liberal Freedom and Solidarity SaS with 13. 3 percent (22 seats) and conservative   which took 11. 2 percent (18 seats). Nine parties entered parliament according to the poll, including the   Slovak National Party (SNS  —   13 seats) with eight percent, touted by analysts as a possible Fico coalition partner.
