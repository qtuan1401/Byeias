Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos outlined his belief today on Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM Patriot 125 that “America is the greatest country in the world. ”[Talking with Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon and Breitbart News    Alex Marlow, he described Americans who aren’t proud of America “as the most disturbing, distasteful and cringeworthy” people.  Yiannopoulos said it was mystifying to him how someone could “have the good fortune, the luck, to be born in the greatest country in the world, the country that actually really still matters,” yet still “dislike their own country. ” He described America as “the country that dictates the future of all others, that gives you more freedoms than opportunities anywhere else in the world, where you can say be whoever you want, that’s raised women and minorities far above any other country, that has done the best and the most to show what is possible, the limits of human achievement and accomplishment. ” “Europe meanwhile is sliding into socialism whilst the European superstate marches on,” he added.  The trio also discussed how European media refuses to identify Muslim’s when reporting on stories that surround them, particularly for issues of terrorism as well as the sexual assaults that took place in Cologne. The European media is full of “remarkable euphemisms,” he said. “It is however tipped over into outright lying and mendacity. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
