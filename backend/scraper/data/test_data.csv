"['Star Wars' Actor John Boyega: Films Made Him 'Exhausted, Frantic And Paranoid']",Actor John Boyega revealed in a new interview he thought about quitting acting as he powered through numerous projects in recent years. Boyega known for his role as Finn in the “Star Wars” franchise told Men’s Health a number of back-to-back films and a stage role left him “exhausted frantic and paranoid.” The films including a “Pacific Rim” sequel and “Star Wars: Episode VII” were part of a period where he had no time off according to the magazine. “You’re tired by your own dream what you love” Boyega said. The actor who described a hiatus he took to “recharge” told Men’s Health his “battery power” has been ambition. That battery power however has pushed Boyega to wear himself down before. “It’s tiring and it’s stress and then dealing with the fact that you eventually have to perform” Boyega said. “There are many different ways careers can exhaust you but the artistic way is unique.” Boyega also weighed in on racist comments “Star Wars” Actor Moses Ingram who is Black received after playing Reva in this year’s Disney+ series “Obi-Wan Kenobi.” Boyega himself faced racism after playing Finn in “Star Wars: Episode VII.” He told GQ in 2020 that he was the “only cast member who had their own unique experience of that franchise based on their race.” “Nobody else had the uproar and death threats sent to their Instagram DMs and social media saying ‘Black this and Black that and you shouldn’t be a Stormtrooper.’ Nobody else had that experience” Boyega told the magazine. “But yet people are surprised that I’m this way. That’s my frustration.” Boyega told Men’s Health his experience helped bring the racist attacks against “Star Wars” actors of color “to the freaking forefront.” He said “Star Wars” production company Lucasfilm will now “make sure” actors are well supported if they face criticism. “I’m glad I talked out everything at that time” he said of his willingness to speak out about the remarks fans sent him. The actor also revealed he got advice from Robert Downey Jr. who suggested he would find who he is in the film industry. “It might be rocky but you’ll come out the end with a solid identity. That’s literally what happened to me” Boyega said.
[Texas City Tells NRA-Linked Group To Hold Their Gun Raffle Somewhere Else],HONDO Texas (AP) — The Texas city near where 19 children and two teachers were shot dead in an elementary school classroom has rescinded a deal for a gun group’s fundraising event in a city-owned hall. The Hondo City Council voted 4-1 Monday to rescind the rental agreement for the Friends of the NRA to hold its fundraiser Saturday at the city’s Medina Fair Hall. The vote came after an angry crowd denounced the event including a raffle of a semi-automatic rifle similar to one an 18-year-old gunman used in the May 24 shootings at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde 44 miles (70 kilometers) east of Hondo. ‘It's a slap in the face to all of Uvalde’ — Uvalde TX families and residents were met with snickering and jeers when they spoke up at a neighboring town's city council meeting about a local NRA fundraiser that would be raffling off an AR-15 pic.twitter.com/ACnuc0AmuR The group has held similar fundraisers in the hall for about 15 years and had leased the hall last spring the San Antonio Express-News reported. Hondo is 33 miles (53 kilometers) west of San Antonio. Supporters of the local National Rifle Association group asserted that the event helped teach young people how to handle firearms responsibly and that there was no disrespect toward the Robb Elementary dead intended. Others in the crowd Monday condemned the event and its timing. Hondo city council has revoked the right for the Medina County friends of the NRA to have their fundraiser this Saturday.+A very visibly reaction from those in support of the 21 families of the victims. pic.twitter.com/PdnhzPpyO4 “Us as parents deserve better than this. I mean you can’t sit here and try to sell a rifle strikingly similar to the one that killed our children you know less than 60 days after they passed away” said Angel Garza stepfather of Amerie Jo Garza who was among those killed.
[Stephen Colbert Spots Trump Acolyte Kari Lake's Most Baffling Election Claim Yet],Stephen Colbert spotted a genuinely odd moment in a speech given by Kari Lake the conspiracy theorist and Republican candidate for governor in Arizona who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump.  Lake declared that there was fraud in Tuesday’s primary ― before the vote was even held. Lake then claimed victory in the strangest way possible: She said barely any votes had been counted yet she had won seven out of every 10 election day votes. “That is massive! And those votes are not counted yet. There is no path to victory for my opponent and we won this race period” she said.  “I’m sorry what? What’s happening?” Colbert asked then tried to summarize: “She said the votes were barely counted. Then she said she was winning seven out of 10. Then she said the votes were not counted yet. Then she said she won.”  Then he showed how that logic might’ve played out during the Super Bowl in his Wednesday night monologue:
[GOP Senators Say Kansas Abortion Result A 'Wake-Up Call' For Party],WASHINGTON ― Republican senators were surprised by Tuesday’s huge win for abortion rights in Kansas of all places even as they sought to downplay the electoral implications for their party ahead of November’s midterm elections. “It’s definitely a wake-up call for us” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) acknowledged on Wednesday.  “Kansas which is a pretty red state ― it’s hard to find the words. I think people should look at it” added Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) when asked for his reaction on the vote.  In the first election test after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade Kansans rejected an amendment advanced by the right that would have stripped abortion protections from their state constitution — a huge win for abortion rights advocates that will likely set the tone for what’s to come nationally. Democrats said the vote which favored protecting abortion rights by nearly 20 percentage points as well as historic voter turnout in the primary election sent a loud message to the nation that Americans support abortion rights. They predicted the GOP would come to rue helping overturn Roe at the ballot box.  The vote is likely to make Republicans in swing districts nervous especially if they’re on the ballot with a similar referendum on abortion like in California. It’s still unclear however whether voters in other states without abortion rights explicitly on the ballot will head to the polls in similar numbers in November. Republicans argue that concerns over heightened inflation particularly gas and food prices ― coupled with poor approval ratings for President Joe Biden ― will dwarf the issue of abortion and push them to victory in both the U.S. House and the Senate.  “I think the biggest motivator for voters this time is going to be the economy” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) predicted on Wednesday. Still it’s hard to make the case that voters aren’t paying more attention to abortion rights and where their elected leaders stand on the issue after the Kansas blowout.  Even polling from Senate Republicans’ campaign arm has suggested the party’s stance on abortion rights isn’t politically ideal: In May following the leak of a draft of the Supreme Court decision that ended Roe the National Republican Senatorial Committee released a polling presentation on how their candidates should discuss abortion issues. In it they asked voters to choose between two candidates. The first a Republican supports “banning abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions for the life and physical health of the mother or severe fatal abnormality of the baby.” The second a Democrat “supports unlimited abortion up until the moment of birth.” The poll found 53% of voters would choose the Republican while just 28% would choose the Democrat. The obvious flaw in the survey? There does not appear to be a single member of the Republican caucus who holds the outlined position. GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska both support abortion rights and opposed the overturning of Roe v. Wade which protected abortion after 15 weeks. The other 48 Republican members all support bans well before 15 weeks of pregnancy if not total bans on the procedure. The presentation instructed Republicans to be the “compassionate consensus builders” on abortion. “I do think it’s always best to be in touch with what your constituents support. Kansas has a 22-week ban on abortion. I think it’s a policy that a good number of Republicans seem to think is OK” Tillis said Wednesday.
[Melanie Lynskey Details How She Was Harshly Body-Shamed While Filming ‘Coyote Ugly’],Melanie Lynskey opened up this week about her painful memories of being mocked for her body two decades ago. She and her “Yellowjackets” co-stars Juliette Lewis Christina Ricci and Tawny Cypress reflected on their early days in the entertainment industry for a profile for The Hollywood Reporter published Wednesday. In the interview Lynskey shared her experiences from being on the set of 2000′s “Coyote Ugly” where she was body-shamed and pressured to lose weight. “All the girls had this regimen they had to go on. It was ridiculous” Lynskey said. “I was already starving myself and as thin as I could possibly be for this body and I was still a size four.” She described at the time having to wear Spanx in wardrobe fittings and receiving criticism about her body from the costume designers and people doing her makeup on the film’s set. “Just the feedback was constantly like ‘You’re not beautiful. You’re not beautiful’” she said. “In your early 20s so much of it is about beauty and how people respond to you and do people want to fuck you?” The late 1990s and early 2000s weren’t a particularly kind era when it came to women’s bodies. Kate Winslet recalled last year on the “WTF with Marc Maron” podcast that she was subjected to a lot of “personal physical scrutiny” for not being rail-thin in 1997’s “Titanic.” Jessica Simpson created a media frenzy in 2009 when she showed up to an event wearing a pair of size-four jeans — and was ruthlessly made fun of for being “overweight.” Lynskey told Vulture in May that she faced this kind of pressure after her breakout role in 1994′s “Heavenly Creatures” which she co-starred in when she was just a teenager.  At the time she was constantly reminded that she was not “thin confident pretty” she said. “Mostly thin” she explained. “There was a certain pleasant energy they wanted people to have. Unchallenging. And I wasn’t successful doing that.” She added that she struggled with disordered eating since the age of 12. “I had for a very long time been on this diet that was basically 800 calories a day and if I ate anything over 800 calories I would throw up” she told Vulture. “I was never bingey. Sometimes I’d be starving and I’d have another teacup of Special K. Then I’d be like ‘Well now I gotta throw it up.’” She said when she began dating actor Andrew Howard who she met on the set of the 1999 film “The Cherry Orchard” he gave her a wake-up call in the form of an intervention. Despite what Lynskey has gone through she still deals with her fair share of body-shaming to this day. She hit back at “Yellowjackets” fans on Twitter back in January after they accused her of not being thin enough. “The story of my life since ‘Yellowjackets’ premiered” she tweeted at the time. “Most egregious are the ‘I care about her health!!’ people… bitch you don’t see me on my Peleton! You don’t see me running through the park with my child. Skinny does not always equal healthy.” The story of my life since Yellowjackets premiered. Most egregious are the “I care about her health!!” people…bitch you don’t see me on my Peleton! You don’t see me running through the park with my child. Skinny does not always equal healthy https://t.co/W2poMmsv1p
[Jennifer Coolidge Says 1 Role Helped Her Sleep With 'Like 200 People’],"Jennifer Coolidge didn’t have to bend and snap to catch anyone’s attention after one of her most iconic roles. The beloved character actor told Variety that thanks to playing Stiffler’s mom — aka the O.G. MILF — in the 1999 movie “American Pie” she was able to really bolster her body count. “Ya know I got a lot of play being a MILF” Coolidge told the outlet in a video promoting a larger profile about the “White Lotus” star. “And I got a lot of sexual action from ‘American Pie.’ There was so many benefits to doing that movie … There would be like 200 people that I would never have slept with.” Jennifer Coolidge on the benefits of being a MILF in #AmericanPie: ""There would be like 200 people that I would never have slept with!"" https://t.co/FhlBAoU12a pic.twitter.com/8aUeuzmgEB But don’t write off Coolidge as merely an opportunist — she has also proven to be quite altruistic. Last year for instance she bestowed the world with a truly brilliant idea for the plot of the highly anticipated “Legally Blonde 3” movie.  “I hope Reese Witherspoon and I are running really fast for most of it we’re running from something really fast” she told E! News at the time."
[Kyrsten Sinema Is Demanding Democrats Keep A Tax Break For The Super-Wealthy],Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) wants Democrats to drop a provision tightening a tax loophole associated with hedge fund managers and private equity executives from their $740 billion package enacting President Joe Biden’s climate health care and tax plans according to reports from Politico and Axios.  Sinema’s apparent desire to nix the provision — which raises just 2% of the proposal’s total revenue and does not even fully close the loophole — does not immediately endanger Democrats’ hope of passing the legislation out of the Senate in the coming days. But it shows how the moderate first-term senator is willing to protect some of the country’s wealthiest Americans from even small tax hikes. Sinema’s office would not directly confirm nor deny the reports and said the senator is still reviewing the legislation and awaiting rulings from the Senate parliamentarian on its contents. Politico and Axios also reported Sinema wants additional funding for drought resiliency — a key priority for Arizona where water supply remains a top issue. The carried interest loophole is infamous. It allows hedge fund managers and venture capitalists to have their income taxed at the 15% capital gains rate instead of at much higher income tax rates often saving them millions of dollars a year. Wall Street has worked ferociously to defend the loophole over the course of the past decade ensuring its survival despite pledges from Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump to eliminate it. The loophole is now most closely associated with the private equity industry where it applies to the 20% of a fund’s investment profits that its managers take in on top of a fixed fee. If Democrats close the loophole managers will instead pay the top marginal income tax rate of 37%. Democrats’ existing proposal agreed to by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) would not eliminate the loophole. It would instead require managers to hold investments for five years instead of three years to get the more favorable rate and create stricter requirements for those investments. Manchin and Schumer’s proposal would raise just $14 billion over the next decade while a plan from Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) to completely close it would’ve raised $70 billion.  Still even the modest proposal appears important to Manchin. “On the carried interest — for the wealthiest one-tenth of 1% of Americans to take advantage of a tax break for them that they have no risk at all and they get to take the lowest tax rate?” Manchin told a local West Virginia radio host last week. “So we got rid of that.” On Wednesday Manchin said he wanted an explanation from Sinema.  “I just want someone to explain. I can’t understand it” he told Fox News of her reported opposition. He did not suggest tightening the loophole was make-or-break: “I’m sure Sinema has a reason and I want to hear more about it.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) perhaps the Senate’s leading proponent of taxing the wealthy has worked with Sinema to craft compromise proposals in the past. “Americans understand that the tax code has been twisted and manipulated to protect the richest among us and they’re sick of it” she told HuffPost. “Narrowing the carried interest provision is something that makes the code just a little fairer. And we should hang on to it.” The overall package gets most of its cash from stricter IRS enforcement and from instituting a 15% corporate minimum tax which aims to block large companies from zeroing out their tax bills with credits and deductions. It spends about $300 billion reducing the deficit and $370 billion on clean energy and climate change projects. It also gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs and funds subsidies for Obamacare. On Tuesday Sinema discussed the legislation with the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers two groups who oppose all of the tax hikes in the legislation.  Thanks to @SenatorSinema for taking the time to chat with Arizona business leaders & manufacturers about our concerns with the  reconciliation bill. Always appreciate the Senator’s thoughtful approach & willingness to listen to AZ job creators. @AZManufacturing @ShopFloorNAM pic.twitter.com/cdNDK7zIg9 Her business-friendly positioning has paid dividends for her campaign account: In 2021 alone she received more than $144000 in donations from industry groups that lobbied against closing the carried interest loophole. More recently she took in $100000 from Wall Street and $50000 from pharmaceutical companies in the second quarter of 2022 alone. “We can only assume that she’s been motivated by the money they’re donating to her campaigns” one former Sinema staffer speaking on condition of anonymity because they still work in Democratic politics told HuffPost. “I knew she was always trying to be an atypical Democrat. She wants to be Arizona’s new maverick. I never thought she would just toe the party line. But throwing away campaign promises you made and snubbing your nose at the people who got you elected that makes you the opposite of a maverick. It makes you a corporate shill.” Igor Bobic contributed reporting.
"[Door By Door, A Small Group Of Kansans Changed The Abortion Debate]",Just over a half-million people in Kansas radically altered the political debate about abortion on Tuesday. Not only did they vote to reject a referendum that would have removed abortion protections from the state constitution but they did so by a double-digit margin with a stunning surge of turnout in a state that former President Donald Trump recently carried by 15 points.  This has either panicked or thrilled political consultants nationwide and filled Wednesday’s airwaves and newspaper columns with analysis. It was the first test of abortion rights after the Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade in June and the result was unambiguous.  But before the landslide win and talks of national political landscapes it was mostly ordinary people like Janelle Bogart who were doing the real work. Bogart a pro-choice organizer with a day job in sales let HuffPost tag along as she canvassed houses in 103-degree heat in a Wichita suburb a week before the election.  One woman answered the door with a cat in her arm and a young son who came up to her hip. “Don’t worry I’m voting no!” she said in regards to her vote in favor of abortion rights.  Bogart decided to skip the houses that had “Vote Yes for Value Them Both” lawn signs. She did her best to be as genial and warm as some residents watched from their lawns or eyed us from their pickup trucks while we zigzagged through the neighborhood.  While cheerful and friendly Bogart’s take-no-shit energy is sugar-coated with some midwestern charm. It makes her extremely adept at knocking on strangers’ doors – especially those who don’t agree with her.  “Half the house is on one side and half the house is on the other” one older man who answered the door told Bogart. He walked out onto his porch with a barking Shih Tzu at his ankle. (One perk of canvassing Bogart noted: “You get to meet a ton of cute pets.”)  The man politely declined Bogart’s pro-choice pamphlet multiple times before we made our exit. “Education is paramount!” Bogart told him while waving goodbye before whispering to me: “He was definitely not taking my literature.”  Kansans for Constitutional Freedom the pro-choice collective that recruited canvassers like Bogart accomplished what many believed was impossible: A win on abortion rights in a red state after the fall of Roe.  Abortion is already heavily-regulated in Kansas and Republicans had a lot of advantages going into the ballot initiative. The vote was held during a primary election which is normally a closed election with a lower turnout that skews mostly Republican. Pro-choice advocates and lawmakers also claimed Republicans intentionally made the language of the amendment vague and confusing to mislead voters. Kansans received a deceptive text message the night before the election urging them to vote yes on the amendment because it “will give women a choice” and “protect women’s health” even though a vote in favor of the amendment would have taken away abortion protections. The texts which were unsigned were later linked back to a Republican-aligned firm that had connections to former U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). Some conservatives accepted defeat. “Words could never express the sadness and emotion myself and many Kansans are feeling after the Value Them Both amendment was not adopted. This is an enormous blow to efforts to protect the sanctity of life in Kansas” Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) said in a statement to the press Tuesday night.  Others however downplayed the impact of the pro-choice win in Kansas. Mollie Hemmingway editor-in-chief at the Federalist said on Fox News that abortion rights advocates greatly outspent anti-choice organizations but there’s no evidence that was the case. Although both sides spent about the same on advertising. And one National Review reporter made the somewhat ludicrous assertion that voters were misled by pro-choice groups because it was a “falsehood” that voting “yes” on the amendment meant abortion would go away – rather it just meant the state legislature would decide the issue. But both sides understood throughout the campaign exactly what the largely Republican body would do if the measure passed. Both conservative pundits also implied that anti-abortion initiatives might be more successful with more incremental changes.  Despite the uphill battle abortion rights won out in Kansas. Voters chose to preserve abortion protections in the state by a double-digit margin – with a historic voter turnout as high as Kansas saw in the 2008 presidential election.  Some of this can be attributed to the Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson which repealed Roe less than two months ago. Seventy percent of Kansans who registered to vote after the Dobbs ruling on June 24 were women according to political data and research group TargetSmart.  “Kansans had a unique opportunity to protect their constitutional rights and freedom at a time when those rights had just been stripped at the federal level” said Ashley All the director of communications at Kansans for Constitutional Freedom. The Supreme Court’s decision was “a wake-up call” for all Kansans but especially more moderate voters who thought their rights were safe under Roe All added.  And the state of abortion access has never been more dire since Roe fell underlining the importance of the outcome of Kansas’ ballot vote. Around a dozen states in the South and Midwest have already severely restricted or banned abortion. Texas Oklahoma South Dakota Missouri and Arkansas all have total abortion bans in effect. North Dakota Nebraska Wyoming and Iowa are in court challenging severe restrictions or waiting on bans to take effect. Put all those states together and you have most of the Midwest and much of the South – making Kansas an unexpected sanctuary state for abortion care.  There was also the idea that Kansans weren’t voting for a politician – they were voting for a singular issue or belief system.  “There’s this unique culture in Kansas where we care for our neighbors and we really do look out for the people in our communities” said Nigel Morton an organizer at URGE: Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity one of the groups under the Kansans for Constitutional Freedom collective.  “As far as getting a rap for being a deep conservative state we do have some major conservative players but they’re just the loudest” Morton added. “I think most Kansans are really on the side of progressive history.”  Kansas has a large contingency of unaffiliated voters: About 44% of registered Kansans are Republicans 26% are Democrats and 29% are unaffiliated. Republicans were banking on those unaffiliated voters not showing up for a primary election but pro-choice organizers canvassed and phone banked for months to ensure that every Kansan knew what was at stake.  The number of unaffiliated Kansas voters speaks to the state’s rich legacy of always paving its own path. Once dubbed “Bleeding Kansas” it was the first free state in the Civil War. It was one of the first states to ratify the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote. Kansas also has also had three Democratic women governors including its current governor Democrat Laura Kelly who won her primary election on Tuesday.  Kansans for Constitutional Freedom also took a tactical approach to talk about abortion rights. Its messaging relied on personal liberties freedom and eliminating constitutional rights. The group worked with organizations that spanned the political spectrum and many of their advertisements didn’t even use the word abortion.  “This was really successful because we focused on this as a non-partisan issue” All said. “We were able to engage folks in a non-partisan conversation about this issue and that is something that really played to our strengths and really helped us move forward. People see this much more as a personal health care issue they see it as a complicated moral and sometimes religious decision. But it comes down to a personal decision.”  The country will likely see similar campaign tactics in other states in the near future as several ballot initiatives on abortion rights are coming up. Vermont Pennsylvania Montana Michigan Kentucky Colorado and California may vote on ballot measures in November.  Bogart the local organizer appropriately spent election night collecting ballot boxes from polling places. When she finished she brought pizza to a polling spot where people had been waiting in line to vote for nearly three hours. The 37-year-old said she became emotional when the overwhelming number of pro-choice votes were reported. “We had a lot of women who put their lives on hold for the campaigning and the marches and the canvassing. With everything that was against us: They tried to put it on a primary ballot they were spreading lies about what the amendment meant they were very heavily funded by all the church groups” Bogart said through tears. “It feels good. It feels like we’re unfuckable with. Don’t try to come after us because we will organize and get things done.”

"[Gov't Inaction Could Wipe Out A Defining Feature Of The Grand Canyon, Environmentalists Say]",Environmentalists say falling water levels upriver from a dam ― along with its inadequate architecture ― could cause the Colorado River which flows through the Grand Canyon to “effectively dry up” The Arizona Republic reported. A report released by the Utah Rivers Council the Glen Canyon Institute and the Great Water Basin Network is calling on Congress to repair the Glen Canyon Dam.  The dam which is more than 50 years old is located along the Colorado River and upriver from the Grand Canyon and Lake Mead the largest reservoir in the U.S. and a key source of drinking water in the Southwest.  The Glen Canyon Dam created Lake Powell which stands at 3536 feet above sea level an amount that’s 46 feet away from hitting the minimum level (3490 feet) needed to produce hydropower according to the newspaper. However if water levels continue to drop at Lake Powell the dam’s infrastructure won’t allow it to bring water downriver and could reduce river flow “to less than half” Environment & Energy Publishing said. The effects of declining water levels could impact water delivery “to irrigate farms and fully supply cities from Phoenix and Las Vegas to Los Angeles and Tijuana” per The Arizona Republic. The report detailed the dam’s “antique plumbing” specifically the pipes below hydropower-generating levels that weren’t “designed to permanently deliver large quantities of water.” The pipes can bring a limited amount of water through the dam and the environmental groups behind the report described “serious questions” about whether they were capable of funneling water long-term. The groups are calling on the federal government to draft ways to redesign the dam. “We are once again in a situation where our water leaders’ strategy their plan to deal with shortages appears to be crossing their fingers and hoping for snow and rain” Zach Frankel the Utah Rivers Council’s executive director told E&E Publishing. “The time has long since passed to have real meaningful leadership in this aridification megadrought.” Arizona Water Resources director Tom Buschatzke told The Arizona Republic it would be prudent to investigate changes to the dam’s infrastructure. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation an agency that oversees the dam has committed $2 million in funding toward finding ways to continue to deliver water and power an agency spokeswoman said.
[Driver Pleads Guilty In Hit-And-Run Death Of Nicki Minaj's Father],MINEOLA N.Y. (AP) — The driver in a hit-and-run crash that killed the father of rapper Nicki Minaj last year was sentenced Wednesday to a year in jail in keeping with a promise the judge made when the man pleaded guilty in May. Charles Polevich who pleaded guilty to leaving the scene and tampering with evidence in the crash on New York’s Long Island that killed Robert Maraj was also ordered to pay a $5000 fine and had his driver’s license suspended for six months. Polevich’s lawyer Marc Gann suggested his client may have had a medical issue at the time of the crash and that he wasn’t fully aware of what had happened when he fled. Polevich 72 said in court that he’s “been heartsick since realizing the extent of the tragedy” and that there was “no excuse” for his behavior. Maraj’s widow Carol Maraj said in court that Polevich had left her husband “like a dog on the street” and that sparing him a longer jail sentence was a “slap in the face for the family” Newsday reported. Polevich struck Maraj 64 while Maraj was walking along Roslyn Road in Mineola in February 2021. Polevich stopped briefly to ask Maraj if he was OK but didn’t call for help prosecutors said. Instead Polevich went home parked the car — a white 1992 Volvo station wagon — in his garage and covered it with a tarp prosecutors said. Maraj was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead the next day. Prosecutors sought a sentence of one to three years behind bars but Nassau County Judge Howard Sturim said in May when Polevich pleaded guilty that he would get “no more than one year in jail.” Brendan Brosh a spokesperson for the Nassau County district attorney’s office said that “given the severity of the defendant’s conduct” prosecutors felt a stiffer sentence was warranted. “We continue to express our condolences to the family of Robert Maraj” Brosh said. Gann asked for a 90-day jail sentence arguing that other factors outside of Polevich’s control were partially to blame for the crash including road construction street lights that weren’t working and Maraj’s physical condition. Maraj’s widow Carol Maraj is suing Polevich over the crash. Polevich who had been splitting time between Long Island and Guam where he runs a drilling and water purification business surrendered to police a few days after the crash. Detectives said they used pieces of surveillance video to track the Volvo involved in the crash to Polevich’s Mineola home. Nicki Minaj the platinum-selling Grammy-nominated rapper of “Anaconda” “Super Bass” and other hits was born Onika Tanya Maraj in Trinidad and was raised in Queens. In a post on her website Minaj 39 called her father’s death “the most devastating loss of my life.”

"[U.S. Slow To Ask For Monkeypox Vaccines, Adding Months To Delivery Schedule: Report]",The Department of Health and Human Services failed to ask for supplies of a vaccine to contain the growing surge of monkeypox during the early days of the outbreak prompting deliveries to be pushed back until later this year The New York Times reported Wednesday.  Officials in the Biden administration told the newspaper that by the time the federal government placed orders for the vaccine from a manufacturer in Denmark the company had already booked in other clients in countries dealing with their own outbreaks of the disease. The U.S. which has invested more than $1 billion in development of the vaccine will only be able to distribute about 1.1 million doses over the coming weeks far short of the 3.5 million health officials say are needed the Times added. An additional 500000 doses are expected in the U.S. in October but millions more on order likely won’t be delivered until sometime in 2023. The U.S. currently has the highest number of confirmed monkeypox cases in the world after the first case was identified in May. There are more than 6600 known infections with more than a third of those occurring in New York and California. Cases so far have almost exclusively affected gay and bisexual men but health officials stress that anyone can contract monkeypox which is spread mainly through close physical contact. There have been no deaths linked to monkeypox in the U.S. The Biden administration has been criticized for stumbling in its response to the outbreak. The U.S. once had about 20 million doses of the vaccine stockpiled in freezers but they were allowed to expire without being replenished. Hundreds of thousands of vials were sitting in Denmark in May when the outbreak hit American shores but it took weeks for the government to request most of them. The delay in delivery is presenting a new struggle that mirrors the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. effectively owns about 16.5 million doses of vaccine stored in Denmark by the manufacturer Bavarian Nordic the Times reported. But the highly specialized process of getting those doses from bulk storage sites into individualized doses is limited and other countries placed orders for the manufacturer to do so before the U.S. did. Officials hope a domestic manufacturing company could speed up the timeline but it is still expected to take months to get a plant on board. The effort comes amid growing criticism that the U.S. hasn’t been doing enough to quickly contain the spread of the disease. Several states — New York California and Illinois — have declared public health emergencies due to the monkeypox outbreak and vaccine supplies are far behind demand. Many high-risk people have struggled to find appointments and some states have opted to give patients just one of the suggested two-dose regimen to make their vaccine supplies go further. President Joe Biden tapped two senior emergency response officials to manage the government’s handling of the monkeypox outbreak. The White House said Robert Fenton a regional administrator at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a former acting head of the agency as the White House monkeypox coordinator. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis who heads the Division of HIV Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will work as his deputy.
[Tucker Carlson Launches Cringeworthy New Attack On Kamala Harris' Name],Fox News host Tucker Carlson is treating Vice President Kamala Harris’ name like she’s Lord Voldemort. Carlson who has incorrectly said Harris’ name in the past again cooked up a wrong name for Harris on Wednesday Mediaite reported. “The Democratic Party at this point is a cartel that exists only to perpetuate itself and the elderly mediocrities who run and benefit from it” Carlson said. “All of them. Carmela Harris is only 57 years old.” Carlson continued to repeat his “Carmela” name for Harris. The host referred to Harris by her actual name during his Tuesday episode before incorrectly changing the pronunciation. “Kamala Kimala Carmela whatever the vice president what’s she up to?” Carlson asked. It's been two years and Tucker Carlson still refuses to say Kamala Harris' name properly. pic.twitter.com/s0mYwLnayB Harris is seemingly aware of the “Carmela” mispronunciation as she used a lighthearted clip of children mispronouncing her name in different ways during her successful 2016 campaign for U.S. Senate.  The Fox News host mangled her name back in 2020 and he wasn’t pleased when his guest former Democratic presidential campaign adviser Richard Goodstein corrected him. “OK so I’m disrespecting her by mispronouncing her name unintentionally” replied Carlson who has a history of peddling white nationalist conspiracy theories to his viewers. “So it begins. You’re not allowed to criticize Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris or whatever.” “It’s not ‘whatever’” Goodstein said. You can watch the clip of the exchange below. Tucker Carlson loses it when a guest corrects his pronunciation of Kamala Harris's name pic.twitter.com/1fHIrPGuwN Carlson has a history of mispronouncing names on his show whether its Ottawa or CNN anchor Don Lemon although he seems to particularly fail when it comes to the names of left-leaning people of color. Earlier this year Carlson referred to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as “Sandy Cortez” and also repeatedly bungled Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s first name.
[Detroit Probably Won't Have A Black Member Of Congress For First Time In Decades],Detroit occupies a unique place in Black American history. The Michigan city was a critical stop on the Underground Railroad that took the enslaved to freedom. It was also the destination for generations of Black Southerners migrating North for greater opportunity and the birthplace of the culture-defining sounds of Motown. That’s why some Black residents of Detroit which remains nearly 80% Black are disappointed that the city is on the brink of lacking a Black representative in Congress for the first time in almost 70 years.  “It’s historic and it’s devastating” said Mario Morrow a Detroit-based Democratic political consultant.  The Motor City has had at least one Black representative in Washington D.C. since it sent late Rep. Charles Diggs Jr. to Congress in 1954. Some Black Detroiters are now concerned that their unique experience shaped by generations of institutional racism struggle and hard-fought progress will lack an authentic voice in the nation’s capital. “Civil rights human rights and racial equality have been major planks for Black lawmakers representing Detroit” said Jamon Jordan the city of Detroit’s official historian. “They rose in the African American community in popularity based on their commitment to those kinds of issues.” The proximate cause of Detroit’s impending dearth of Black representation was the defeat of Black candidates in Tuesday’s Democratic primaries. The state’s nonpartisan redistricting process split Detroit into two redrawn congressional districts: Michigan’s 13th which contains most of the city and Michigan’s 12th which has part of Detroit’s west side. Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) who is currently Detroit’s only Black representative in Congress announced plans to retire rather than run for re-election in the new 12th District. Instead Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib a Palestinian-American and progressive darling ran in the 12th most of which she already represented. Tlaib a two-term incumbent easily defeated her three challengers – all of them Black women – on Tuesday. That left Michigan’s 13th the state’s last district where a majority of the residents are Black and the seat where Black Detroiters hung their highest hopes of a victory. In the end though state Rep. Shri Thanedar an Indian American multi-millionaire chemical testing entrepreneur who spent more than $8 million of his fortune on his congressional run defeated eight Black candidates to secure the Democratic nomination on Tuesday. There is still a very remote possibility that an unforeseen event such as a write-in campaign will result in Thanedar’s loss in the general election. Voters also have the opportunity to rally behind Black Republican nominee Martell Bivings a business development specialist. But given the 13th District’s strong Democratic leanings observers believe that that is unlikely. “As of right now it looks very likely that there will not be an African American representing Detroit in the United States Congress” Jordan said. Morrow cautioned against over-interpreting the factors that led to Thanedar’s election describing it as an outlier.  “Shri Thanedar was elected by default and I think he knows that” Morrow said. Indeed the runner-up state Sen. Adam Hollier would likely have overcome Thanedar’s 5-percentage-point margin of victory if there had been one or two fewer candidates in the race. Hollier benefited from the support of a pro-Israel super PAC and other outside backers that jointly spent more than $6 million on his behalf. But the free-for-all contest for the Democratic nomination in Michigan’s 13th speaks to the decline of a centralized political authority capable of rallying Black Democrats behind a single candidate.  The absence of a convening figure or institution was also apparent during 2018′s primary to replace Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.). Conyers a now-deceased civil rights hero and progressive titan who had represented Detroit since 1965 resigned in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Then as now the sheer number of Black contenders diluted the Black vote and paved the way for another candidate – Tlaib – to triumph. That outcome disappointed some Detroiters who had hoped to replace Conyers with another Black lawmaker. “There hasn’t been a well-oiled machine in Detroit since Coleman Young” said Morrow referring to Detroit’s first Black mayor who served from 1974 to 1994. “He would have called a meeting in the basement with everybody and said ‘This is how we’re going to do this. You’re either going to roll with it or you’re not going to roll at all.’” Morrow added: “We still are looking for leadership – true Black leadership in the city.”  There are many potential reasons why the political machine over which Young presided declined in influence in the 21st century. The city’s bankruptcy in 2013 the roughly concurrent election of white former Republican Mayor Mike Duggan and the subsequent rise of the Bernie Sanders-inspired progressive movement all exposed Black Detroiters to alternative routes to political power Jordan posited. At the same time the Republican Party had begun working harder to recruit Black candidates in more conservative parts of Michigan. In a twist that would have been hard to predict just a few years ago the two Black candidates most likely to represent Michigan in Congress this cycle are GOP House nominees John Gibbs in Michigan’s 3rd Congressional District in the Grand Rapids area and John James in Michigan’s 10th just north of Detroit. In the near term Thanedar who ran as a champion of racial justice has extended an olive branch to those Black Detroiters who did not support him. Among other promises he has pledged to fight for reparations for Black Americans a cause he also championed in Michigan’s state legislature. But Thanedar who moved to Detroit from Ann Arbor to run for the state legislature in the 2020 election must contend with the suspicion that he lacks a sincere commitment to the values he professes. In an unsuccessful 2018 bid for governor Thanedar endured scrutiny for the neglect that dogs and other domestic animals suffered after a testing facility he owned went bankrupt in 2010. During that campaign Thanedar also took time to attend a theatrical play about his own life that a supporter adapted from his autobiography. “He is going to definitely have to have a coming-to-Jesus meeting with the Black leadership of the 13th Congressional District primarily in Detroit. And he is going to have to prove himself on bringing home the bacon and building bridges” Morrow said. “And if he doesn’t they’re coming after him in two years and there will not be eight other people running against him. It will be a targeted well-organized campaign.” Morrow is skeptical of Thanedar and his campaign promises. “The jury’s still out on Mr. Thanedar” he said. “I want him to prove me wrong. Because I don’t think he’s going to deliver.”
[Biden Urges Senate To Act On Gun Control On Third Anniversary Of El Paso Shooting],President Joe Biden released a statement on Wednesday urging the Senate to take action on gun control marking the third anniversary of the shooting massacre in El Paso Texas in 2019. In a letter Biden called on Senate Republicans to pass a bill banning assault weapons nationwide and reflected on the hate-fueled shooting at a Walmart that left 22 dead. “We will never forget the lives lost or the courage and resilience of those injured and the loved ones they left behind” Biden wrote. “The House recently passed a bill that would ban the weapons of war like the one the El Paso gunman and so many others have used to take and injure so many innocent lives in a matter of minutes. The Senate needs to act on that critical piece of legislation.” The assault weapons ban which passed the House in July would prohibit the sale of certain high-powered weapons including rifles shotguns and pistols except for specific antique and sporting models. Republicans have already called the bill “unconstitutional” and a ploy by Democratic lawmakers to confiscate guns. In June Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act which he called the “most significant gun violence reduction legislation in 30 years.” “I signed bipartisan legislation to improve hate crimes reporting and enhance training for law enforcement to identify and respond to hate crimes” Biden said. “And last year my administration laid out our country’s first-ever comprehensive effort to counter the threat posed by domestic terrorism.” The act would also provide $250 million in funding for community-based violence prevention initiatives. On Aug. 3 2019 a 21-year-old extremist entered a Walmart in El Paso Texas and opened fire killing 22 people and injuring 26 others. Other deadly shooting tragedies that have taken place in recent history include Uvalde Texas where another gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May. Earlier that same month an 18-year-old extremist shot and killed 10 Black people in a Buffalo New York supermarket.
