Former President Bill Clinton said that his wife had the flu, diverting from the campaign’s claim that she was diagnosed with pneumonia. [“It’s a crazy time we live in, you know, when people think there’s something unusual about getting the flu,” Clinton said. “Last time I checked, millions of people were getting it every year. ”  But why would Bill Clinton say that Hillary have the flu when the campaign specifically cited pneumonia? A spokesperson for Bill Clinton asserted to to reporters that the former president simply “misspoke” during his speech and meant to say pneumonia. The former president made his remarks while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee in Las Vegas Wednesday afternoon. Clinton said he was “glad” for the opportunity to speak for Hillary. “It’s about time I showed up and did it for her,” he said. He added that he spoke with his wife earlier in the day and said she was “feeling great. ” Earlier in the week, Clinton asserted to CBS broadcaster Charlie Rose that she was dehydrated, but acknowledged that a friend of the family recently contacted them about her husband who had pneumonia. “Apparently there is a lot of it going around. And a bunch of her staff had gotten sick,” Clinton said. “But, she’s just doing fine. She just got dehydrated yesterday. ”
