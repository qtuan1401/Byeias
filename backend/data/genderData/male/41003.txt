 (CNN) For the first time in his illustrious career, Tiger Woods is no longer considered one of the world’s top 100 golfers. The   major champion, who has spent a total of 683 weeks at the top of the sport’s official rankings, has now dropped to 104. Woods is currently sidelined with injury    a recurring theme in recent years    and last played on the PGA Tour in early February. The    says he remains hopeful of participating in the year’s first major, the Masters at Augusta, that begins on April 9. Woods’ 2015 has not gone to plan. He shot a career worst round of 82 at his first tournament of the year in Phoenix before withdrawing from his second at Torrey Pines due to injury. In February, he announced he was taking an indefinite break from golf, saying his play was ”not acceptable for tournament golf.” Most recently, he skipped the Arnold Palmer Invitational    a tournament he has won eight times    and said he hoped to be ready for the Masters. Woods has four green jackets among his haul of major titles, all accumulated in a   period between 1997 and 2008. His last significant Tour victory came at the Bridgestone Invitational back in 2013, but he has rarely threatened in recent major championships. Woods jumped into the top 100 in September 1996, after a Tour win in Las Vegas, hitting the top spot the following year after the U. S. Open.
