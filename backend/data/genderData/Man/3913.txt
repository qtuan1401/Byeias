Ford will spend $640 million to replace door latches on nearly 2. 4 million cars, trucks and vans because the doors can pop open while the vehicles are moving. On Thursday, the company announced it would add 1. 5 million vehicles to the growing   recall, which has become so costly that Ford had to cut its estimated   pretax profit to $10. 2 billion from at least $10. 8 billion. Customers have been complaining about the problem, which has affected much of Ford’s North American model lineup, since 2014. At least three million vehicles have been recalled after a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation found 1, 200 customer complaints about doors failing to latch. Thursday’s announcement came under pressure from the highway safety agency, which deemed an Aug. 4 recall of about 830, 000 vehicles inadequate. Ford said in a regulatory filing that the $640 million would cover the cost of both the Thursday recall and the one announced Aug. 4. The latest recall includes the   Ford Focus, the   Ford Escape and   the 2015 Ford Mustang and Lincoln MKC and the   Ford Transit Connect small van. Ford says a spring tab in the door latches can break, and the doors either won’t close or could pop open. Dealers will replace the latches without charge. The company said it knows of one crash and three injuries that may be related to the problem. The Aug. 4 recall was limited to Mexico and 16 states with high temperatures and sunlight exposure because, Ford said, the rate of reports of failure was higher.
