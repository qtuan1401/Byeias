’  ’ ’   Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro  at the age of 90. ’ ’   Castro was a monumental and controversial figure in 20th century   politics. He seized power from Cuban dictator Fulgencia   Batista in 1959 and ruled over Cuba  —   first as prime minister,   and then as president for decades. ’ ”   Here’s how leaders from around the world are reacting to Castro’s   death. ” ’   ”Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who   oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s   legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering,   poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.” ’ ’   At this time of Fidel Castro’s passing, we extend a hand of   friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills   Cubans  —   in Cuba and in the United States  —   with powerful   emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro   altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the   Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact   of this singular figure on the people and world around him. ’ ’  ’ ’   ” ’ ’   ”Rosalynn and I share our sympathies with the Castro family and   the Cuban people on the death of Fidel Castro.” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Fidel Castro’’s death cannot bring back his thousands of victims,   nor can it bring comfort to their families. Today we remember   them and honor the brave souls who fought the lonely fight   against the brutal Communist dictatorship he imposed on Cuba.” ’ ’   ” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ” ’ ’  ’
