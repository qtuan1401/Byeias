Amazon released the first trailer for its upcoming Woody     television series Crisis in Six Scenes on Wednesday. [The trailer gives viewers a closer look at Allen’s character Sidney Munsinger, a married suburbanite caught up in the social turmoil of the 1960s whose world is turned   by the arrival of Miley Cyrus’ hippie character.  “I don’t dislike you, just everything that you stand for,” she tells Munsinger in the trailer.  Crisis in Six Scenes marks Allen’s first serious foray into television. In an interview with USA Today at the Cannes Film Festival in France last year, Allen warned that the   series could wind up being a “cosmic embarrassment” for Amazon. “This was a catastrophic mistake for me. I’m struggling with it,” Allen told the outlet. “I never should have gotten into it. I thought it would be really easy, to do six  . I thought it would be a cinch. But it’s not. It’s very, very hard. ” Amazon was forced to defend its collaboration with Allen at the Television Critics Association Press tour shortly after the series was announced last year, after the auteur’s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, leveled sexual assault allegations against him in a   open letter in the New York Times. “I think you have to look at the whole picture but  …     yeah, take everything into account, but our focus is on the fact that he is a great filmmaker and storyteller,” Amazon Studios head Roy Price told reporters when asked about the allegations against Allen. “And so we look forward to the show in 2016. ” Crisis in Six Scenes also stars Elaine May, Michael Rapaport, Lewis Black, Joy Behar, Rachel Brosnahan and John Magaro. The series begins streaming on Amazon Prime September 30.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
