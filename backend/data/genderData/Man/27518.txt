President Barack Obama officially ruled out his wife as a future political candidate, saying that she did not have the patience to be president. [“She is as talented and brilliant a person as there is, I could not be prouder of her, but Michelle does not have the patience or the inclination to actually be a candidate herself,” he said during an interview on the Sway in the Morning radio show.   “She will never run for office,” Obama said, adding that listeners could “take it to the bank. ” Michelle Obama’s popularity has skyrocketed among Democrats, particularly after she spoke at the Democratic National Convention for Hillary Clinton. Yesterday, Michelle Obama spoke to a crowd of 11, 000 people in North Carolina with Clinton, earning louder applause from the audience than the Democratic candidate did. Earlier this week, former Obama adviser David Axelrod also bet against the First Lady running for office. “People say to me all the time, ‘Well, do you think she might run for office sometime? ’” Axelrod said during an interview. “I would bet everything that I own against that prospect. ”
