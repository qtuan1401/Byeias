Republican presidential candidate Gov. John Kasich called Antonin Scalia an “essential” force for conservatism in a statement following the Supreme Court Justice’s death on Saturday. [“I am deeply saddened by the passing of Justice Scalia and send my prayers out for his family in this difficult time.  His death is a serious loss to our nation and the Court.  He was an essential, principled force for conservative thought and is a model for others to follow.  His dedication to the Constitution and love for and service to our country will be deeply missed. ”  Scalia, 79, died of apparent natural causes at a Texas resort. Scalia was appointed to the Court by Ronald Reagan in 1986. Now the Republican appointee’s seat on the bench will be filled by President Barack Obama.
