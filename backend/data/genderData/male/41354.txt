Architecture website Architizer has just announced the winners of its 3rd annual A+ Awards, highlighting the best new building designs from around the world.  This year’s awards cover more than 90 categories, including everything from residential and commercial properties to cultural architecture such as museums and religious buildings.   A collection of 300 judges, made up of industry experts have chosen five finalists from entries in each category. They’ve also selected one winner from these for their ”Jury” prize.  There’s also a ”Popular Choice” winner in each category, which is determined by the public through online voting.  According to the rules, entries must have been completed no earlier than 2011.  It was a challenge given how many incredible developments won awards this year, but we pulled together a few of our favorites in the gallery above.
