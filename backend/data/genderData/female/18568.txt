Friday at a rally for his wife, Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton, in Riverdale, NY, former President Bill Clinton downplayed the role Wall Street is playing in “the misery of America” and pointed out that New York City’s boroughs other than Manhattan were diversifying their income.  “Look, I really sympathize with a lot of these young people who are excited about being told that there is one explanation for the misery of America and that is the greed of the Wall Street banks. But the truth is, Wall Street is smaller and New York City is growing like crazy, led by the Bronx and Brooklyn and Queens and entrepreneurs in New York that are in Manhattan that are diversifying the income, right? So what are we going to do about this?” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
