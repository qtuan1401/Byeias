Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is taking on Washington, DC. [On Breitbart News Daily, Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon interviewed the chief executive of the Hoosier State. As Breitbart News reported, the governor set forth his accomplishments enhancing Indiana’s   environment. The reason that such a   state could still lose 2, 100 jobs to Mexico, Pence explained to Bannon, is the   direction of the Obama administration.  “I am a good   Heartland   conservative,” said Pence. Policies that reflect such a philosophy grow businesses and create jobs. But when the entire nation adopts the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, coupled with a crushing regulatory environment, some businesses will leave America entirely. “It’s heartbreaking for the families affected,” Pence said, emphasizing that he’s ordered state personnel to help find new jobs for Carrier’s current employees. “We’ve got to have change starting this November from the leadership in Washington, DC,” referring to the race for the White House.
