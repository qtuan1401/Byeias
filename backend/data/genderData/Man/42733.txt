If there is one thing that made us all human, it is our love for bubble wrap. From toddlers to seniors alike, the product made hugs better and provided endless possibilities for fun. There’s even a Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day. Again, the traditional version will remain. But if that goes away, there will always be the digital version.
