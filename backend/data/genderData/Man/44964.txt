’  ’ ’     There are decent Republican people.   ’ ’     There are Republican      and      and      who promote principles of public decency.   ’ ”     But there aren’t enough of those individuals to have prevented     the Republican Party, as a national institution, from becoming     one that welcomes and encourages violence and       racism.   ” ”     The party’s   history is obviously not spotless. But 10     and 20 years ago the Republican party was usually forced to          and      its openly racist, fascist elements, if only for reasons of     political expediency. Not so anymore. Consider:   ” ’     Are there elected Democrats who express dubious views and     commit crimes? Yes! But when those individuals get caught, they     resign.   ’ ’     They become, for example, ”disgraced former congressman Anthony     Weiner.” But the idea of disgrace is no longer a relevant     concept in a Republican Party whose leaders and voters     collectively condone and encourage violence against women,     violence against the press, and the expression of       views. That’’s not hyperbole, or a cheap     shot —  it’’s just reality. Happy Memorial Day!   ’ ’There are decent Republican people. There are. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
