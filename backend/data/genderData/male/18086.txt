A comic book store in   North Carolina, has unveiled a new comic cover with a transgender hero fighting against the state’s bathroom bill, the   Journal reports. [The store Ssalefish Comics has commissioned an exclusive cover for the comic Alters showing a transgender woman replacing male and female bathroom signs with gender neutral ones.  The cover relates to the North Carolinian House Bill 2, which seeks to “provide for single sex multiple occupancy bathroom and changing facilities in schools and public agencies. ” Bret Parks, the owner of Ssalefish, said, “I wanted the cover to take a jab at HB2, but I didn’t want anything   . ” “I thought this was a direct and effective way to comment on HB2, but at the same time not alienating a comic book fan who just wants to read the comic,” he continued. The comic went on sale yesterday at a special signing event with cover artist Richard Chase for $10 per book, significantly higher than the $3. 99 for the standard version of the comic, due to its exclusivity. Ten percent of the proceeds from sales of the comic will be donated to Equality NC, a trans lobby attempting to overturn the HB2 bill.
