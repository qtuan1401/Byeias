On Friday, the UCLA Undergraduate Students Association (USAC) announced plans to launch the “UCLA Institute on Campus Violence” in response to the murder of Professor William Klug. [The institute would use university funding “to study strategies to combat campus violence,” particularly as it relates to   attacks.  According to the Daily News, USAC Vice President Rafael Sands “decried” Congressional failure to stop gun violence on school campuses. Sands gave particular focus to Congress not enacting more gun control in the wake of the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary. Sands did not mention that the commonality between Sandy Hook Elementary and the UCLA   was not the type of gun used nor the age or ethnicity of the gunmen. Rather, it was the fact that both occurred in gun free zones —  in places where Mainak Sarkar (UCLA) and Adam Lanza (Sandy Hook) knew they would meet no resistance. But perhaps most importantly, Sands failed to note that California has nearly every gun control that Democrats on the federal level pushed in the wake of Sandy Hook. California has firearm registration, firearm confiscation laws, and universal background checks, among other controls. None of these hindered the UCLA attack in the slightest. We have seen the same thing in Paris, where gun controls far exceed those in California. Yet on November 13 gunmen opened fire on concert goers, killing 130. At some point, Americans will have to come to grips with the fact that gun free zones —  coupled with burdensome rules for   citizens to acquire firearms —  create a world where only the criminals have guns. And that means, only the criminals have an advantage. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
