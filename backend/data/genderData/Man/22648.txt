On Friday’s broadcast of “CNN Newsroom,” author, journalist, CNN Political Commentator Carl Bernstein stated that the FBI taking another look at Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails is “a real bombshell. ” and that FBI Director James Comey wouldn’t have made the announcement “unless it was something requiring serious investigation. ”  Bernstein said, “We don’t know what this means yet, except that it’s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying that there is more information out there about classified emails, and call it to the attention of Congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. ” He added, “Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty that we won’t learn before the election. ” Bernstein also stated, “[W]ith some knowledge, she might be able to stop, turn things around, and give us some idea of what’s going on in a way that we might not otherwise know, and also, it’s very possible that some members of Congress very quickly are going to get an idea of what these emails are, and what this is about, and also, for whatever purpose, put some information out there. ” (  Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
