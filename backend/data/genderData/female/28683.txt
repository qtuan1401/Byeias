Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson says if he were president, one of the first things he would do would be to “get rid of the Caliphate. ”[“We get rid of the caliphate. Unless they have territory, they don’t have legitimacy,” Carson told Breitbart News Daily’s Stephen K. Bannon. Carson also said that he would be willing to put boots on the ground if necessary.  Carson discussed the need for Congress to formally declare war against ISIS. “We need to understand that we are in a war, that’s why I called upon Congress to declare war against ISIS. It puts us on a different footing all together. People need to understand that this is extraordinarily serious. This is an existential threat to us. ” The Republican candidate said that his plan to destroy ISIS would include cutting off its financial lifeblood. “We have to make sure they have no oil revenues, we either take the oil or we destroy the oil. But we do not allow that because ISIS is the richest terrorist organization on earth. We have to shut down all their monetary channel. ” He also said that he understands that there may be civilian casualties. “I recognize their command and control center, we know where they are. You send your special ops in at 2 am in the morning and you wipe them out. If there happens to be some collateral damage, so be it. That’s war. There is no such thing as a clean and sterile war. ” “We have to teach our people what to do if they are in a terrorist attack because there will be more believe me. San Bernardino is not the end of it by any stretch of the imagination” Carson added. “We need to start teaching our people what to do. The last thing we need to do is what President Obama suggests, is take guns away from American people when we have jihadists over here trying to kill us. ” Hear the interview:
