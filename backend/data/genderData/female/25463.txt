The Obama White House insists Hillary Clinton is more than qualified to be president. [Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz defended Clinton’s credentials.  “The President has said that Secretary Clinton comes to this race with more experience than any other   President in recent campaign history,” Schultz said. The reiteration of Obama’s support for his former Secretary of State is a rebuke to Sen. Bernie Sanders, who attacks her as not being qualified for president. “The President was fortunate to have Secretary Clinton serve as his Secretary of State for four years, when they worked together on some of the world’s most complicated and complex issues,” Schultz said. “And he’s proud of that service. ” But Schultz declined to discuss Sanders criticism that Clinton enjoyed the support of a Super PAC  —   the same one that supported Obama fore  . “I know that this is a heated campaign season, and campaigns are going to trade barbs back and forth. And the good news for all of you is those campaigns have highly paid communication professionals who would be happy to answer your question,” he concluded.
