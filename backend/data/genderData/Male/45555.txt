”If you are concerned about the declining price of oil, you should probably know what China  —   the world’s   oil consumer  —   has been doing with its oil industry for the past year.” ’It has prepared its refiners to dump a massive load of supply onto an already oversupplied market.’ ”All of this has to do with China’s attempt to invigorate its private markets  —   to liberalize its economy.” ’Last year, China allowed small, private oil refineries, called teapot refiners, to start buying up crude oil  —   a lot of it. That crude oil was never meant to just stay in China and supply the domestic market. China always intended to sell the refined oil products to the rest of the world.’ ’”According to CEIC China’’s total import volume of crude oil increased by 8. 8% YoY in 2015, which is slightly lower than the growth rate of 9. 3% in 2014,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent note. ”However, the majority of crude oil is consumed by refineries, which are turning to export final products. ”’ ”Why export? Because of the most serious, immediate problems facing China’s slowing economy. More from Morgan Stanley [emphasis ours]:” ”Teapot refiners are now expected to gobble up 20% of China’s oil imports in 2016, . Thanks in part to their output, which has increased  China is now a net fuel exporter.” ”Initially, Wall Street thought the teapots’ entrance onto the scene would be good for the falling price of oil. Analysts all over the industry thought the teapot refineries’ appetite for oil would drive up global demand.” ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ”So the volatility that we’re seeing in the stock market that seems correlated to this continued supply glut, and the deflationary force that is lowering oil prices, isn’t going anywhere if China has any say in the matter.” ”The country’s oil industry is just getting started.”
