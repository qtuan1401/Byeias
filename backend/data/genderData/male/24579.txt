A Pokemon Go player from Oregon recently was stabbed while catching Pokemon but continued to play the game before seeking medical attention.[  old Michael Baker was searching for Pokemon around 1AM when he came across someone he believed to be a fellow Pokemon Go player. Baker asked the individual if would he like to battle. The individual took the term “battle” a bit too literally and proceeded to stab Baker in the shoulder.   “I saw him go by and asked if he was playing Pokémon Go. He was like ‘what?’ I guess he wanted to battle because he came up at me with a knife,” Baker said. “Right after I was stabbed, I continued my mission to Plaid Pantry for chips and beer, I basically risked my life,” he added.  Police confirmed that Baker had indeed reported a stabbing but refused to be treated in order to continue his quest to be the very best and collect all the Pokemon in the surrounding area. When a Facebook friend complimented Baker on his actions, Baker replied, “Thanks man, you just have to be the best trainer you know. ”  Many news stories have appeared in the past few days relating to Pokemon Go and real life crimes surrounding the game. Pokemon Go players have also been asked to stop playing the game at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D. C.
