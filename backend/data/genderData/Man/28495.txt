During a speech on the Supreme Court at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, MILO predicted how Hillary Clinton’s Supreme Court would treat the Constitution.[  “The left, as we know, sees hate speech, racism, and sexism everywhere” declared Milo, imagining how the a Clinton Supreme Court would treat the First Amendment. “Expect a leftist supreme court to give such a broad definition of hate speech that even the United Nations will be jealous. ” “Next, religious freedoms” he continued.  “Any hope of religious groups to be free will be snuffed out by a liberal court” Milo claimed, adding that they would “be required to comply with federal programs like Obamacare” and “marry whatever tranny orgy stumbles into the chapel at 3AM” while making “pizza for them too”. “In short, every religion will suffer under this court” he concluded. “Except of course for Islam, which the left bends over backwards to pander to, and this court will be no exception. ” Written from prepared remarks.
