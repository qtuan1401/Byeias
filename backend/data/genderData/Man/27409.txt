In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News ahead of the New Hampshire primary, conservative columnist and   New York Times bestselling author Ann Coulter warned that if the   gets its way and Marco Rubio is the Republican nominee, it will be the “end of America. ”  “THE END OF AMERICA,” Coulter wrote when asked what she thought a Rubio nominee would mean for the future of the open borders movement. “Rubio is [John] McCain is sheep’s clothing,” Coulter explained. “He’s the Manchurian candidate. At least with McCain, conservatives knew we were getting an open borders zealot and just made the calculation that he could win. Rubio has half the conservative movement thinking he’s Reagan. I’ve never seen anything like it. He’s McCain without the war record or experience. ” In a   memo documenting Rubio’s “betrayal” of conservatives, living legend and grassroots heroine Phyllis Schlafly seemed to echo Coulter’s assertion. Schlafly’s memo states: There is no single major distinguishing policy difference between Marco Rubio, John McCain or Lindsey Graham. They have the same trade policy, immigration policy and foreign policy.  But on immigration most especially  —   the issue in which all four have invested the most  —   there is no daylight separating them. The difference, then, is one of persona, not policy.  And in the arena of immigration, this translates into a vital difference.  The biggest change from   which could not get out of the Senate, and the Gang of Eight  —   which was nursed along by conservative pundits despite being to the left of Kennedy’s bill  —   was the presence of Rubio.  Rubio created the conditions necessary to produce a considerably more open borders bill: conservatives who were invested in the Rubio Brand provided no early pushback but accepted Kennedy’s old talking points, and Rubio gave red state Democrats the political space necessary to support it.  This is how it got 68 votes in the Senate. The stakes of course are raised considerably if Rubio is President or Vice President. Rubio would have a much, much better chance than Obama of getting an open borders bill through Congress  …     there is likely no person in the United States of America in a better position to enact mass immigration legislation than a President Rubio  …     Rubio is the candidate of open borders, Obamatrade and mass immigration, making one last attempt to pull off one big con. In her memo, Schlafly documented Rubio’s history of successfully deceiving conservatives. Schlalfy notes that Rubio, without any seeming compunction, “repeatedly lied” to conservative media and opinion makers who trusted him: “His deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama’s claims about disastrous Obamacare. ” Schlafly’s memo continues: The seminal moment of the media tour occurred early, on Rush Limbaugh’s show. He [Rubio] declared: “If there is not language in this bill that guarantees that nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place, I won’t support it. ”  Of course, we know there wasn’t any such language but he voted for it anyway. But this promise  —   and many others  —   and the calculated neutralization of conservative media, helped Schumer get 68 votes. But conservatives trusted Rubio. Limbaugh declared: ‘you are meeting everybody honestly.’ Rubio told [Sean] Hannity, on his media tour that: “I don’t think any of that [amnesty] begins until we certify that the border security progress has been real. That a workplace enforcement mechanism is in place. That we are tracking visitors to our country, especially when they exit. ”  This prompted Hannity to reply: “It’s probably the most thoughtful bill that I have heard heretofore. ”  At this point, it looked like the biggest mass immigration plan in history would breeze through Congress  —   all without Rubio saying a word about what was really in the heart of the bill: the largest immigration expansion in American history.  To this day, Rubio will not answer if asked about how many green cards his bill gave out. ” Like Coulter, Schlafly has previously warned that if immigration is not stopped: “We’re not going to be America anymore. ”  If we don’t stop immigration —  this torrent of immigrants coming in —  we’re not going to be America anymore because most of the people coming in have no experience with limited government. They don’t know what that is. They look to the government to solve all of their problems, and as soon as we have a high majority of people who think that, it’s going to be a different country. To this day, Rubio continues to support giving citizenship to illegal immigrants, substantially expanding visa issuances for foreign guest workers, increasing refugee resettlement, and surging immigration beyond all known historical precedent.
