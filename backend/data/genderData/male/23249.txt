Rep. Steve King says he will leave empty his gallery seat at President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address in honor of the millions of babies who have been aborted under Obama’s watch. [In a press statement, King observed:  President Obama’s first official act, immediately upon his inauguration was to sign an executive order to accelerate abortions  . The first tears we have seen him shed in seven years were for the victims of the tragic Sandy Hook School shooting. As far as we know, Obama has never shed a single tear for even one of the more than 9 million babies aborted under his watch. He is the most   president ever. King noted Obama’s decision to reserve an empty seat next to First Lady Michelle Obama to commemorate “the victims of gun violence who no longer have a voice. ” “The San Bernardino victims’ body temperatures had declined only from 98. 6 to 93 degrees F when Obama twisted the ‘Allah Akbar’ screaming bloodlust into an     Amendment tirade,” King said. “I am sickened by the acts of war twisted into ‘workplace violence’ and by a president who would veto the   Abortion Survivors Protection Act, H. R. 3504, that would protect the lives, at least of those who survived the attempt on their lives, by abortionists. ” King said he would reserve an empty seat “to commemorate the lives of more than 55 million aborted babies, ‘the chorus of voices that have never been heard in this world but are heard beautifully and clearly in the next world. ’” “My seat on the floor of Congress will also be empty,” he added. “I will be in the Member’s chapel praying for God to raise up a leader whom he will use to restore the Soul of America. ”
