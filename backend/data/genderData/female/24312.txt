A Baton Rouge Police Department (BPRD) officer is now fully conscious and responding   to family and friends after being shot in the head on July 17 by a Black Lives   who went on police officer killing spree. [Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Deputy Nick Tullier, 41, was originally called to the scene of an   shooting when killer Gavin Long ambushed three Baton Rouge police officers, Montrell Jackson, Brad Garafola and Matthew Gerald, ultimately killing them.  When he arrived, Tullier was the first respondent to the ambush, where Long eventually emerged from a wooded area and shot a multiple bullets into the   ’s head, leaving him with significant brain stem damage, his family reported. In October, Breitbart Texas reported how Tullier remained in a coma until recently, according to doctors working with Tullier’s family at the TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston. In a press conference about Tullier’s recovery, doctors and rehabilitation experts said the officer “is aware of his surroundings, understands questions and commands, answers ‘yes’ and ‘no’ by moving his head, recognizes loved ones and can even read words,” as   reported. Tullier’s family was hopeful that their father, son, and husband was able to hear them —  saying his presence was clear, but his ability to respond was still lacking. “You can definitely tell that he can hear when we are talking to him,” Tullier’s fiancé Danielle McNicoll said at the time. “A lot of times he’ll open his right eye, he moved his head, he moved his toes. He’s there. It takes a lot out of him. Medically he should not be here, and he is. ” “[His family and friends] have really high hopes for Nick,” McNicoll continued. “They see in his charts and his progress that God willing he can make a   recovery. ” John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
