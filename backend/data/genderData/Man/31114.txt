On Tuesday’s broadcast of ABC’s “The View,”   Joy Behar apologized for her remarks the day before where she referred to the “tramps” who slept with former President Bill Clinton while discussing the Clinton accusers who attended Sunday’s presidential debate.  Beharr said, “I want to clear something up about yesterday, because, during a political conversation yesterday, I made a joke, and I want to apologize. I never, ever intend to belittle sexual assault, or the women who were victims of it, ever, but I made a joke. I’m sorry. I apologize. ” (  The Hill) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
