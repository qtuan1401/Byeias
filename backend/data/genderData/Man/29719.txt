Two men who were arrested in the Austrian city of Salzburg while posing as refugees have confessed to planning further terror attacks in Paris. [The men were arrested at a migrant centre near the city on suspicion of belong to a terror group after being stopped by border guards who discovered they had fake Syrian passports. They were trying to travel on to France, but were turned back.  According to Rosenheim24, the pair arrived on the Greek island of Leros in October around the same time as the men who launched November’s terror attacks in Paris. Although the ended up in Salzburg, reports suggest they were really heading to Paris where they hoped to launch more attacks. The    Algerian and    Pakistani, who have not been named, applied for asylum in Austria and had their fingerprints taken. They had reportedly been in contact with Abdelhamid Abaaoud, one of the ring leaders of the Paris attacks who was killed in a shootout. So far, the Salzburg prosecutor’s office has only confirmed that six people are in detention on suspicion of involvement in a terror organisation. Last month, Breitbart London reported how Austria has seen a large rise in handgun ownership as concerns grow over terrorists potentially infiltrating the migrant influx. In Vienna, the number of weapons permits issued grew exponentially last autumn, rising from around 100 in September to 457 in November. Arms industry spokesman Robert Siegert said: “It’s certainly true that people’s general sense of unease has increased,” adding that larger weapons shops in urban areas have reported surging sales. In the Austrian region bordering Slovenia, the main entrance point for migrants into the country, gun sales have risen fourfold in the space of a year. Gun shop owner Franz Dorfners even said he had sold out of his entire stock of pepper spray, and it would be a matter of weeks before he could restock.
