Actress Scarlett Johansson says the right to abortion is not just a women’s rights issue, but also “a human rights issue. ”[Speaking at the 2016 Power of Women Los Angeles luncheon Johansson  —   a longtime defender of Planned Parenthood  —   said the abortion business “has been under attack for many years now for  …    providing a safe place for legal abortions. ”  “A women’s right to choose what to do with her body shouldn’t just be a women’s rights issue  —   it’s the year 2016 and this is a human rights issue,” the actress added, reports Variety. Johansson, who was honored at the luncheon along with Helen Mirren, Miley Cyrus, Ava DuVernay and transgender Laverne Cox, continued: A women’s right to choose is a deeply personal one and should not be a part of anyone’s political platform. It has nothing to do with politics in the slightest. It is about honoring and respecting women and upholding the law.   …     It is time we all stand united so this conversation is taken off the ballot, so to speak, and out of the mouths of politicians. Avengers star Robert Downey, Jr. presented his   Johansson with her award at the luncheon, praising her for her support of Planned Parenthood. “She’s utilized her worldwide visibility   …     she is a true ambassador for women’s health initiatives,” Downey said.
