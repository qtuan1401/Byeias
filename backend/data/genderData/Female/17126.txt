A Hong Kong man has created a $50, 000   humanoid robot prototype in the image of Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson. [Ricky Ma, a    product and graphic designer who has been obsessed with robots since his childhood, spent more than a year building a lifelike bot from scratch.  Named Mark 1, the robot responds to   verbal commands that are spoken into a microphone, according to Reuters. The droid can also move its arms and legs, and has facial expressions. When told, “Mark 1, you are so beautiful,” the humanoid replies: “Hehe, thank you. ” WATCH:  According to the wire service, 70 percent of the Mark 1 was created using 3D printing, including its skeleton. The skin, which is made from silicone, hides the robot’s mechanical interior, making it appear more human. Ma, who has no technical experience in creating droids, told Reuters: “When I was a child, I liked robots. Why? Because I liked watching animation. All children loved it. There were Transformers, cartoons about robots fighting each other and games about robots. ” Ma believes the importance of robots will continue to grow, and hopes an investor will buy his prototype so he can write a book about his experience creating Mark 1. The man did not say why he chose to have his prototype resemble Johansson.
