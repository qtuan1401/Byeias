A Russian woman called the police to say she had been raped by a Pokémon monster from Pokémon Go in her Moscow apartment. [The woman, who remains anonymous, claimed that whilst sleeping with her husband, she had woken up to find herself being raped by a giant Pokémon on top of her. She consequently called the police, who did not believe her story.  After telling her husband what happened, he advised her to see a psychiatrist, but instead she went to a physic who was also unable to help her overcome her ordeal. “She says there are too many Pokemon at her place and even the dog can sense them. She says the dog barks whenever she plays Pokemon GO,” said Ivan Makarov, reportedly a close friend of the woman. The incident is just one of many controversial stories surrounding the mega successful game. Other stories include the app leading players to registered sex offenders, two Israeli men sustaining serious injuries as a result of playing the app, as well as a warning from the Holocaust Museum in Washington that it was “not appropriate” for visitors to play the game whilst visiting.
