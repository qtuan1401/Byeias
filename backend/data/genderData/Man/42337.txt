Washington (CNN)”Don’t party and tell,” might be the new White House motto.  Administration officials are remaining   on a private party featuring Prince and Stevie Wonder at the White House over the weekend. During Monday’s daily briefing, reporters drilled Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, for details on the   event. It was not included in the President’s public schedule but was documented by guests on social media.  ”The President and first lady did hold a private party at the White House over the weekend, but given the private nature of that event, I don’t have a lot of details to discuss from here,” Earnest said.  Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson let the public live vicariously through him    posting a picture with his arms around his     singer girlfriend Ciara to Instagram. Wilson captioned the photo ”Dancing at The @WhiteHouse to Prince and Stevie Wonder with my lady Ciara. Thanks Mr. President and First Lady!” According to Page Six of the New York Post, 500 guests were in attendance at the private Saturday night concert, including CEOs and an assemblage of movie and TV stars however, the White House said it does not anticipate releasing that     guest list at any point.   The White House made clear that the Obamas paid for the party out of their own pocket. ”The President and the first lady reserve the right to hold private parties at the White House, and they did it on their own dime,” Earnest said. He added that ”most people across the country would acknowledge” that the Obamas should be able to ”open their home up to guests for a private party on a Saturday night.” And open up their home they did    hosting what   writer and   Ava DuVernay called one of the ”best house parties” she had ever been to hands down.
