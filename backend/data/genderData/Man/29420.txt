Avid Hillary Clinton supporter and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban took to Twitter and claimed that   tech giant Cisco was being “accused of treason” by Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer. [Cuban tweeted:  . @Cisco being accused of treason and corruption  by guest on @foxnews right now . .he accused @google and @intel in a @wsj article.  —   Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 2, 2016,  Cuban’s social media screed came, presumably, in response to Schweizer’s appearance on Fox News Monday, where he explained to host Sean Hannity the myriad revelations detailed in a new report released by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) a   government watchdog group. However, according to a transcript of Schweizer’s interview on Fox News, published by Breitbart News, Schweizer never mentioned the word treason, despite Cuban’s baseless accusation that he did. “Mark Cuban needs to read more and pontificate less,” Schweizer said in an email. “Both the FBI and U. S. Army said that Hillary’s State Department tech transfer program benefitted the Russian military,” Schweizer said, alluding to the FBI’s “extraordinary warning,” issued in 2014, to various technology companies  —   including Cisco  —   connected with the U. S.  technology partnership called Skolkovo, cautioning that Putin was potentially using the   technology project to advance the Kremlin’s military technological capabilities. Last week, Schweizer challenged Cuban to a debate after the billionaire tweeted out a bogus   article against Schweizer’s bestselling book Clinton Cash by the   blog Media Matters. “I’m not interested in playing 140 character pattycake on Twitter,” Schweizer said of Cuban. Now Schweizer says the Shark Tank star should “read more. ” The   GAI report, titled “From Russia with Money: Hillary Clinton, the Russian Reset, and Cronyism,” is, perhaps, where Mark Cuban should start.
