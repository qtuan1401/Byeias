A mother from Texas was horrified to learn that the cameras she used to keep watch on her    girls had been hacked and were being live streamed on the internet. [She made the appalling discovery after she found a screenshot posted by another woman on a Facebook group for Houston Mothers, who was trying to alert mothers after stumbling across a free app ‘Live Camera Viewer.’  In a post she wrote, “PLEASE SHARE! HELP ME GET THIS TO EVERY HOUSTON FAMILY! Somebody is bound to recognize this bedroom and stop the exploitation of these children. ” According to security experts, her private cameras had been hacked by accessing the household’s IP address through her daughter’s iPad whilst she was playing a video game, and was consequently live streamed to an online feed. The feed, which is sorted according to the number of ‘likes’ that users give, had been available since July, and had 571 ‘likes,’ meaning at least that many people had been watching it over the course of the stream. The affected mother of three, identified only as Jennifer, told ABC News, “We have security cameras to protect them. I feel like I’ve failed. People are watching my kids in their home, dressing, sleeping, playing. ” She added that she is not currently allowing her children to use the internet, saying that she “just can’t chance it again. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
