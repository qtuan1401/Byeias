From Andrew Blake writing at The Washington Times:  WikiLeaks on Saturday published purported transcripts of paid speeches Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs in 2013. The transcripts appear as attachments included in an email apparently sent to several members of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign by its research director Tony Carrk on Jan. 23, 2016. The subject line of the email is “Goldman Sachs paid speeches,” and recipients include John Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton presidential campaign who has seen his personal correspondence steadily published by WikiLeaks in recent days after having his email account compromised by hackers.
