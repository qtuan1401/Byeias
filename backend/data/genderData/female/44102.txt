’  ’ ”   I won’t keep you in suspense    since Warren Buffett took the   reins of Berkshire Hathaway    S&P 500 ” ”   Berkshire Hathaway’s performance history is perhaps the best     example of the power of compound returns that I have   ever come across. ” ’   Since 1965, the S&P 500 has delivered annualized returns   averaging 9. 7% including dividends. During the same time period,   Berkshire Hathaway has generated an average stock price gain of   20. 8% per year, or slightly more than double that of the S&P   500. In other words, if you had invested $10, 000 in an S&P   500 index fund at any point during the last 50 years, the   investment would have grown to $10, 970, on average, after one   year. The same investment in Berkshire would have grown to   $12, 080. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’  ’ ”   Perhaps the most amazing part of the story is that Buffett and   his team haven’t used any   investing strategies   to produce these results. In fact, this amazing track record of   performance can be attributed to just a few basic concepts that   make up Berkshire’s growth strategy. ” ”   Now, I’m not being pessimistic by making this statement. In fact,   Berkshire Hathaway is one of my largest stock holdings, and I   don’t anticipate that fact changing anytime soon. Rather, this is   what Warren Buffett himself said in his 2014 annual letter to   shareholders, which included a section where Buffett reflected on   Berkshire Hathaway’s past, present, and future. ” ’  trillion  ’ ”   However, by using the same winning strategy he’s been using for   more than half a century, Buffett believes that Berkshire can   still beat the market by a significant margin over the long run,   and as I’ve  I agree. It   just won’t be anywhere near as impressive of a run as Berkshire   has had so far. ” ’     ’ ”I won’t keep you in suspense    since Warren. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
