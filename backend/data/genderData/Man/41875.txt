Washington (CNN)  presidential candidate John Kasich, defended his expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, while slamming President Barack Obama’s signature law at the same time. Kasich, a   governor of Ohio, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on ”The Lead” that his support of a Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, did not amount to support for the Obamacare itself.  Opposition to Obamacare remains a key litmus test for Republican presidential hopefuls.

Other Republican governors, however, refused to take the additional federal money because of their opposition to Obamacare.  Kasich, though, maintained he wasn’t a hypocrite.  ”When you have an opportunity to bring the $14 billion back of Ohio money back to Ohio, that’s not Obamacare, that’s Medicaid,” he repeated. ”I’ve never said I was against the Medicaid program.” If he enters the race, which appears increasingly likely, Kasich would compete for room near the center of the party, possibly even to the left of establishment heavyweight Jeb Bush.
