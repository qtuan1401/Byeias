Monday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” Rep. Charlie Rangel ( ) accused Republicans of being “a party that has the Ku Klux Klan. ”  Rangel said, “Look black folks have been looking for justice in this country. We got Obama, are we satisfied? Heck no. If someone out there is screaming we should not have another black president, I am not saying don’t scream. All I am saying realistically, we have to realize that things have to be done. Even in the great state of New York we got the  $15 minimum wage, but upstate they don’t get it, they get $12. Is that something to knock Governor Cuomo’s political courage about, I think not. If you are looking for something to be different about there  it is plenty no matter who’s running for president. But We are seeing the end of the Republican party as we know it. A party that has the Ku Klux Klan, has the Tea Party, the Freedom Party and it used to be the party of Lincoln, and we are seeing it fall apart. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
