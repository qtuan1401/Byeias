Rep. @SteveKingIA on @NewDay: ”Significant evidence” of voter fraud https:  .  https:  .  Monday in an appearance on CNN’s “New Day,” Rep. Steve King ( ) made the argument that claims of election rigging cannot be completely dismissed.  He told “New Day” host Chris Cuomo there was “significant evidence” of voter fraud. “There’s significant evidence out there that there’s voter fraud,” King said. When challenged by Cuomo that making such claims were dangerous, King explained that one couldn’t be completely dismissive of the possibility and cited a number of examples from over the past two decades to back up his argument. “I wouldn’t say it is completely unsubstantiated,” he replied. “Partially unsubstantiated  —   I would agree with that. But I would look back at the 2000 election and the fiasco in Florida and the 537 votes that decided the presidency and say that if Al Gore had not accepted the decision of the Supreme Court, we would have had discredited elections back then. ” “In the past, there have been in small cases  —   not in larger cases,” he added. “John Fund has done a lot of good work on this. And so that lays a foundation. The way  —   these election laws are not really antiquated. The worst of them began about the time of motor voter and they been opening up this, making it more vulnerable for fraud ever since. ACORN, for example, 444, 000 false or fraudulent voter registration forms that they confessed to. So I want to square it away. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
