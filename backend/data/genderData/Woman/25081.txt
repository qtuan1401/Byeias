A new ad campaign focuses on Hillary Clinton’s relationship with children, featuring several pictures of the Secretary of State with children. [“She would grow up to be one of the most recognizable women in the world,” the narrator explains as the ad begins with video footage of Clinton as a child.  The pair of ads show Clinton hugging children, smiling at children, holding children, comforting children, and talking to children. “It’s in the quiet moments when you see why she does this. For Hillary, it’s always been about kids,” a woman narrator explains. An ad describes Clinton’s record of fighting for children, beginning with the Children’s Defense Fund, working for reform for poor schools as First Lady of Arkansas, working for child health care as First Lady of the United States, and as Secretary of State working to stop trafficking of girls. “IT’S ABOUT KIDS” a message reads in the video.  “Through the years there have been challenges, setbacks but for Hillary, one thing’s never changed, helping children has been the cause of her life and it always will be,” a male narrator explains. As the warm piano soundtracks play with footage of Clinton, a female narrator continues, “that’s the kind of leader she is and kind of president she’ll be. ” The ads are part of an     television buy in eight swing states, according to ABC News.
