Los Angeles (CNN) Halt! A pedestrian stopped a motorist evading California police Friday evening by calmly stepping in front of his car. The chase ended, when police cuffed the man behind the wheel    and the man who stopped him. They took them both of them in, aerial video from CNN affiliate KABC showed. The driver had led police on less of a car chase and more of a car crawl.  In a ”  pursuit,” the driver of a black Mustang convertible led at least three police vehicles down a long stretch of Ventura Boulevard, one of Los Angeles’ major thoroughfares, police said.  It started when police received a call about a possible DUI, and when officers stopped the man, he puttered away from them. ’VicTorY, war over’ On his doors were   signs in red, white and blue, and decorated with stars. One read ”VicTorY, war over we win.” The driver flashed ”V” signs at pedestrians, as he paraded at a snail’s pace past them with his hazard lights flashing. He stopped at intersections for red lights. As he crawled through his last intersection, he met with a pedestrian determined to halt the spectacle. The pedestrian shimmied from lane to lane and blocked his path, as the driver tried to scoot by him     unsuccessfully. The man behind the wheel got out of the car, and put his hands in the air, and the pedestrian took him by the scruff of his shirt and walked him over to a police cruiser, pressing him onto the hood. Three officers brought the driver, who appeared to cooperate with his apprehension, to the pavement and cuffed him, while one other officer more gently walked the pedestrian away by the arms, and put him in cuffs, too. Police said they have not arrested the pedestrian but have taken him in to talk to him.
