GOP Utah senator Mike Lee told Breitbart News Tuesday he was disappointed by the circus atmosphere at the confirmation hearing for Sen. Jeff Sessions (R. . ).[“It is about what I expected —  a little more cowbell than I had predicted —  there have been an unusual number of outbursts within the hearing room,” said Lee.  “I think that is unfortunate   …     It cheapens the proceedings,” said Lee, who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, first when he was a federal appeals judge and then again when Alito was on the Supreme Court. The Senator said people have a right to express themselves guaranteed by the First Amendment, but they should express themselves in a way that does not disrupt the confirmation hearings for Sessions. Lee said since he came to the Senate in 2011, he has come to enjoy working with Sessions. “He is a good man,” he said. “In the six years of working with him, Jeff Sessions has always —  I have seen him many situations —  I have never seen him treat anyone with disrespect  —  even in moments when people were saying things that he strongly disagreed with,” he said. “It speaks volumes about him,” he added. “He is a very good person and I can’t say that about everyone, but I can definitely say it about him. ”
