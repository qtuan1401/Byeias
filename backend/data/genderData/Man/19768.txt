At a press conference, in Washington, DC on Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said the Democratic National Convention will be a “contested contest. ”  Sanders said, “Let me just say a few words about delegate math and our path toward victory. As all of you know, there are a total of 4, 766 Democratic delegates 4, 047 of them are pledged, i. e. they come out as a result of the contests in the various states, 719 are superdelegates. A candidate  —   Democratic candidate needs 2383 votes in order to win the Democratic nomination. Let me be very clear, it is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates by June 14, that is the last day that a primary will be held, with pledged delegates alone. In other words, once more, it is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates by June 14, with pledged delegates alone. She will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. In other words, the convention will be a contested contest. Currently, Secretary Clinton has 1, 645 pledged delegates, 55 percent of the total. We have 1, 318 pledged delegates, 45% of the the total. There are ten states remaining, where we’re going to be vigorously competing, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
