Representative Charles Rangel (  ) has declared that average citizens don’t need guns  —   but he and his congressional colleagues “deserve” to be surrounded by them for protection. [The Daily Caller column was written by Kerry Picket, who asked Rangel what he thought about the difficult and circuitous path to securing a New York City carry permit. Rangel said:  I’m glad to you say that very few people can get it. We don’t need that many guns   …     Overall if it’s difficult to get a concealed weapon permit, I’m glad to hear that. Picket pressed the point by pointing out that celebrities and the “very wealthy” appear to have no problem getting a permit, while average,   Americans are forced to move through the city unarmed. She also suggested that “many” of Rangel’s constituents would “want to carry a concealed carry” weapon if they could get a permit. Rangel brushed off Picket’s suggestion, stating his position that “  citizens just shouldn’t have to carry a gun. ” Picket pointed out that Congress is surrounded by armed security for their defense and Rangel said, “Well, that’s a little different. I think we deserve, I think we need to be protected down here. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
