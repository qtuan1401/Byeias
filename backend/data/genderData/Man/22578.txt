(McClatchy) Any deaths caused by police fire as they battled Omar Mateen inside the Pulse nightclub in the wee hours of June 12 should be blamed on Mateen and not on the responding officers, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said Monday. [“Those killings are on the suspect and on the suspect alone, in my mind,” Mina said.    people, plus the    Mateen, died in the mayhem, and 53 others were wounded. The question of possible deaths by police fire arose soon after the shootings. One survivor, Norman Casiano, 26, told ABC News that he was shot by police when he crawled out from his hiding place in the bathroom after he thought it was safe.
