Katie Gorka, President of the Council on Global Security, discussed what Christians can do to help in the war against Christianity with host Stephen K. Bannon on SiriusXM radio’s Breitbart News Saturday:[On a special Holy Saturday edition of Breitbart News Saturday, host and Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon will continue the discussion on the global war on Christianity we began on the Good Friday episode and will continue through to Easter Sunday. Emphasizing the need for direct engagement, Gorka said, “I think we really do have a moral obligation as Christians and as Americans. People forget that this country was founded because of religious persecution. This country was founded so that Christians could be free to worship without interference by their government. So, I think that as Americans, we have a tremendous moral obligation to fight for that. ”  Asked if we are close to losing the Christian church in the Middle East, Gorka replied, “We’re frighteningly close. There’s just no two ways about it. But on the other hand, there are extraordinary things going on. I think there are still people who are coming to Christ. There are people who are just fearless in defending the Church. The stories that you hear of individual Christians, as well as pastors and priests and the suffering that they are willing to endure to defend Christianity, to stay, should be an inspiration to all of us. And they deserve our support. ” More information on Gorka’s work, as well as the Council on Global Security can be found here: The Council on Global Security (COGS) is a   institution dedicated to promoting security and human dignity through freedom, economic opportunity and rule of law.
