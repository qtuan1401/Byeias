’  ’ ’   When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone in January 2007, he   made a bold claim that the new product was five years ahead of   its time. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   It’s because of the one thing Samsung or anyone   else can’t replicate: iOS. ” ”   Despite Google’s best efforts, the Android ecosystem is still a   fragmented mess. Devices rarely get consistent updates.   Developers tend to make their best apps for it only after the   iPhone version. And Samsung’s version of Android, called   TouchWiz, actually bogs down Android’s UI instead of improving   it.  ” ”   iOS is the only smartphone OS that guarantees your device   will be supported for several years. You’re lucky if you can   find an Android phone that’s still getting updates a year after   you buy it. Meanwhile, Apple tends to keep iPhones updated for up   to four years. If you buy a new Samsung phone, good luck getting   anything new a year from now. ” ”   Security is another issue.

The   iPhone’s lead has never been smaller, and it’s running out   of time before Samsung figures out the rest of the puzzle and   cleans up its software issues. ”
