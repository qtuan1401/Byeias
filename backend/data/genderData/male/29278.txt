Senator Elizabeth Warren has strong words for the National Rifle Association, in spite of —  or perhaps because of —  its success defending Second Amendment Rights. [“The NRA can be defeated and the NRA will be defeated,” the Massachusetts Democrat said during a conference call organized by White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett. “The president has shown that change is possible but it is our job in Congress to show that there are many of us who are willing to fight and that’s how you get sensible gun reforms. We will get it. ”  Jarrett teamed up with liberal champion Warren and other Democratic members of Congress to promote President Obama’s executive actions on gun control. During the call, Warren argued that Congress has had “all the time in the world” to help implement gun control, but even Democrats did nothing during their time in the majority. “If the Republican Party would rather work for the NRA than for the American people and if they won’t do their jobs to keep our children safe then somebody else has to step up,” she said. She recalled that some Democrats had “particular problems” with previous gun reform measures in the wake of Sandy Hook, but suggested that Democrats would be more bold in the future. She added that Obama’s executive actions on gun control were not only “smart” but “reasonable” and would make a “life or death” difference for children. Warren said she was “proud” that Massachusetts has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, but admitted that those laws weren’t enough to prevent criminals from getting guns from gun shows and from other states with weaker gun laws. “This is not about politics, this transcends politics, this is about doing what is right for our kids,” Warren said. “The president has opened that door and I hope the American people will walk through it. ”
