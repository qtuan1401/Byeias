’Every year, Reddit puts on a massive Secret Santa gift exchange, and, every year, one lucky person gets Bill Gates as a Santa. And boy, is he good at it.’ ’Alicia, also known as Reddit user ”Aerrix” (who describes herself as a woman who loves video games, ”The Legend of Zelda,” ”The Little Mermaid,” ”Harry Potter,” and Nintendo) got blown off by her Secret Santa last year. But she faithfully signed up again. And was that ever a smart move.’ ’Her first clue that the billionaire had pulled her name was that the box that arrived was huge. And he spared no expense in shipping it overnight.’ ”Her second clue: Bill Gates wrote her a personal letter and enclosed a picture of himself with the letter, wearing a Santa hat. When you’re Bill Gates and you’re someone’s Secret Santa, part of the fun is proving that this gift really came from you.” ’The letter said:’ ’The huge box was stuffed with individually wrapped presents, 12 in all.’ ’’ ’An ecstatic Aerrix  writing:’ ’”I’’m just blown away by his generosity, which went even further than all these gifts because he submitted a donation to Code. org in my name to give more students the chance to learn computer science, which is AWESOME because it’’s something near and dear to my heart. ”’
