 (CNN) With this pair of new action figures, you’re sure to have a good night and a pleasant tomorrow. A toy company is making figurines of former ”Saturday Night Live” comedians Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, complete with a   diorama of the ”Weekend Update” news desk. (You’ll have to supply your own quick wit and biting remarks.) Entertainment Earth, a toy company with an   history at San Diego   plan to release the exclusive figures at the annual   convention in July (at booth 2343, to be exact). The pair stand 3½ inches tall and wear almost identical suits, with Fey in her trademark eyeglasses. With only 2, 400 produced, the figures are sure to go fast. They’ll also stand out at a convention best known for comic book, superhero and   merchandise. CNN spoke with the company’s brand manager, Jodie Winters, to find out more. CNN: How were you able to work out the idea of ”SNL”  action figures with NBC and the show?  Jodie Winters: (Licensing company) Bif Bang Pow! licenses the ”Saturday Night Live” property from Broadway Video Entertainment. Last year, we made a Seth Meyers ”Weekend Update” bobblehead that did well, so we thought it would be fun to bring fans more ”Weekend Update” product. CNN: Do you know whether Fey and Poehler were involved at all or whether they personally approved the idea?  Winters: Typically, our licensors work directly with the talent   their representatives as required. CNN: Are there any special events planned around the release of these figures? Winters: We just started revealing our plans for San Diego   on Tuesday.  We’ll have plenty more to announce as we get closer to the show.
