’  ’ ’   Former President George W. Bush  that he and his wife, Laura,   were ”heartbroken” over the ambush of Dallas police officers   Thursday night that left five officers dead and seven more   wounded. ’ ’   The Bushes live in Dallas. ’ ’   ”Laura and I are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in   our city last night,” the 43rd US president said. ”Murdering the   innocent is always evil, never more so than when the lives taken   belong to those who protect our families and communities.” ’ ’   ”Laura and I have seen firsthand the dedication, professionalism,   and courage of the Dallas Police Department,” he said. ”Their   commitment to safety and justice makes us proud to call Dallas   home.” ’ ’   Snipers opened fire on police officers Thursday night near the   end of a peaceful protest in the city. Protesters were   demonstrating in the aftermath of the recent     shootings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in   Minnesota. ’ ’’ ’   Dallas Police Chief David O. Brown said two snipers staged the   attack from ”elevated positions” near the protests and that the   department thought the attackers coordinated the ambush. Three   people are in custody in connection with the ambush, and a fourth   suspect was killed by the police after a lengthy standoff. ’ ’   Brown added the suspect who was killed had told the police he was   ”upset about Black Lives Matter” and the recent     shootings. The police chief said the suspect told authorities he   wanted to ”kill white people, especially white officers.” ’
