TMZ Sports spoke with former star NFL running back Herschel Walker, who said he still thinks free agent quarterbacks and fellow former Heisman winners Robert Griffin III and Johnny Manziel can play in the league.  Griffin has struggled with his health and did not dress out for the Washington Redskins in 2015, while Manziel has struggled with issues off the football field. “I know RG3 can play,” Walker said. “RG3 just gotta find a team that’s gonna believe in him. ” He also said Manziel needs to figure out if football is his real passion. “I feel Johnny can play as well. I think Johnny just needs to decide what exactly he wants to do,” Walker added. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
