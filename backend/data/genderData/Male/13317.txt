REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  —   More than 50 have died in the last month as a result of the raging cartel violence in this border city. [As Breitbart Texas has reported for more than a month, rival factions of the Gulf Cartel are carrying out attacks on each other to take control of lucrative drug trafficking territories and smuggling routes.

During the clashes, cartel members use SUV convoys with code signs such as     and   painted on  vehicles. In the most recent series of clashes, three gunmen died firefights on the city’s eastern side.  Despite the efforts of the Tamaulipas state police forces and the Mexican military, cartel gunmen continue their brazen attacks on each other.

The gunmen shot their victim in the middle of the street and then loaded the body in the bed of a pickup before fleeing. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
