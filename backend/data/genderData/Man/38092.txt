 (CNN) We’ve all experienced the feeling of sitting on the plane, waiting to go home, only to learn there’s one straggler who’s keeping us from taking off. You’d think that wouldn’t happen to current presidents, but it can, especially when a famously tardy former president is involved. President Barack Obama was seen impatiently waiting for former President Bill Clinton    not one to be on time    on Air Force One at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv after attending the funeral of former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Obama, standing just inside the doorway of the plane with his tie loosened, can be seen waving Clinton to get on the jet, yelling, ”Bill, let’s go!” while rolling up his sleeves. Someone on the flight crew says something to Obama and he smiles and shakes his head.  ”Bill! Let’s go!” Obama hollers again as Clinton dallies at the bottom of the stairs and other people board. ”Bill! Let’s go. Let’s go home,” Obama says after he walks on the plane’s mobile stairs. Finally, Clinton, delayed after greeting people seeing the US delegation off, strides up the steps and the two presidents go    into Air Force One.
