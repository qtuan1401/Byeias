Wednesday night in an interview with Univision Los Angeles, Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton commented on the State Department inspector general’s report that found she violated the agency rules by using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state and said it will not “affect either the campaign or my presidency. ”  Clinton said, “It’s the same story. Just like previous secretaries of state, I used a personal email. Many people did. It was not at all unprecedented. I have turned over all of my emails. No one else can say that. I have been incredibly open about doing that. I will continue to be open, and it’s not an issue that is going to affect either the campaign or my presidency. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
