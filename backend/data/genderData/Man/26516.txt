Twitter   and former CEO Evan Williams appears to have been hacked by the same group that previously compromised Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Twitter account. [The collective managed to take over Williams’ account and post a tweet stating, “Hey, it’s OurMine Team, we are just testing your security, please send us a message (contactourmineteam@gmail. com),” before it was deleted shortly after.  Williams claimed to Mashable that his Foursquare account was compromised, another social network that appeared to be linked to his Twitter account, and that the collective used this vulnerability to share a message from Foursquare to Twitter. Just this week, Breitbart reported that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had also been hacked by the OurMine Collective, revealing that his password consisted of a weak   combination which he had used for all of his other accounts too. The hackers were able to find out his password through a data leak on the online business network LinkedIn. Dozens of celebrities were also hacked this past week, with the hackers posting offensive and outrageous tweets, though it is unknown whether OurMine had anything to do with these account breaches. OurMine is reportedly located in Saudi Arabia, and are known for previously hacking YouTube personality Markiplier and electronic musician Deadmau5.
