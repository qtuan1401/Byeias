’  ’ ’   Fewer and fewer Americans are on food stamps, and the decline is   only getting faster. ’ ’   According to Paul Trussell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, the   number of people utilizing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance   Program, or SNAP, in June 2016 was down 4. 7% from the same month   a year before, and the number of households using SNAP was down   5. 2%   . ’ ’   ”The month of June represents the biggest YOY decline in persons   and households participating in SNAP in the program’’s history,”   Trussell wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. ’ ’   The primary driver, according to Trussell, is the reinstitution   of work rules by states. During the financial crisis, the federal   government allowed states to waive requirements regarding   employment for SNAP recipients as the unemployment rate soared. ’ ’   Recently, however, this policy has changed as the unemployment   rate has now dropped to below 5% for the country. ’ ’   ”In 2009, the federal stimulus bill allowed states to waive the   work requirement, which limited    adults to three   months of SNAP benefits before they must find a job, in areas   with high unemployment,” the note said. ”These waivers continue   to end in many states either because 1) the federal government   has not extended the waivers, or 2) state governors are opting   out of them.” ’ ’     states have implemented new work rules in 2016, in   addition to 15 that had already put them back in place. ’ ’  ’ ’   According to Trussell, this decrease will not only affect the   families rolling off of food stamps, but also companies that see   large amounts of SNAP spending. Trussell said he expected   negative sales impact at Dollar General (which actually mentioned   the impact during ) Dollar Tree, and Walmart. ’
