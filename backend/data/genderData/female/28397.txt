On Monday’s “MSNBC Live” CNBC Chief Washington Correspondent stated that President Obama’s election was “the most dramatic way Dr. King’s promise was redeemed” while discussing an interview with Representative John Lewis ( ) who remarked, “Obama being treated different because of his race. I really believe that. ”  Harwood said, “Now, of course the most dramatic way Dr. King’s promise was redeemed was the election of Barack Obama in 2008. ” During the interview with Lewis, he stated, “You hear some Republicans say, ‘Hey this president promised to bring the country together, but he’s actually made it more divided. ’” Lewis responded, “I don’t think this president,  —   I don’t think he’s solely responsible for the country being so divided. We all are responsible for it. ” Lewis added, “I don’t think he made it worse. I think there were people, because of his election, [who] made a conscious decision, and said that we will not give him a victory. Obama being treated different because of his race. I really believe that. You wouldn’t hear if it had been a white Democrat, a white Republican, speaking, hear someone holler out, ‘You lie!’ A member of of the Republican Party from South Carolina. I think part of that was race. And you wouldn’t have a governor putting her finger in the face of a white president. I think there have been visible signs of disrespect for the man. And I’ve always said, if you don’t respect the man, respect the position. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
