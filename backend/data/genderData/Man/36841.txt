 (CNN) Several items of US military equipment displayed by ISIS in photos published over the weekend likely was either found or captured after recent battles in eastern Afghanistan, according to a senior defense official. US forces, including many special operations forces, have been fighting in Afghanistan’s Nangahar Province, a stronghold of ISIS for the last several weeks. The photos, distributed by ISIS’s media arm, depict ammunition, fabric packs and possibly a   rocket launcher of the type used by US forces.

But the official said that some of the equipment shown ”is used” by Special Operations Forces.

Three US soldiers suffered minor wounds when an IED struck their convoy while they were on patrol near Jalalabad. A NATO Resolute Support mission spokesperson told CNN that the soldiers suffered minor injuries. Last month, five additional US troops were wounded in combat operations in the area. In the same group of recently released photos, ISIS displayed the military identification card of US Army specialist Ryan Jay Larson, claiming they had captured him. US commanders were able to quickly determine Ryan had lost his card but was with his unit at all times.
