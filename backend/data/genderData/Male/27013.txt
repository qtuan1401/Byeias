Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is receiving some light mockery in national media after meeting Russian strongman Vladimir Putin over the weekend, an exchange Duterte giddily described as concluding with Putin promising to give Duterte a gun as a gift if he visits Russia. [“You know, if China and Russia would decide to create a new order, I would be the first to join,” Duterte said last week, preempting his meetings with their two heads of state.  The Philippines has   ties to the United States, to which it owes much of its security, particularly in the face of aggressive neighbors like China and Russia. Duterte has vowed to shift Manila’s alliances towards its enemies, however, having declared that the Philippines would officially say “goodbye” to America in October after “cross[ing] the Rubicon. ” Duterte’s goodbye appears to be a reaction to the White House’s warnings that his administration should adhere to international human rights norms as it engages in a national war against drug trafficking. As a presidential candidate, Duterte encouraged the extrajudicial killing of drug suspects by both law enforcement and civilians, and repeatedly vowed to kill anyone who opposed a swift purge of drug abuse in the island nation.
