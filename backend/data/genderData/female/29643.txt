[In total, more than 500, 000 people have pressed play on this film.  But, of course, that half million views number does not take into account the massive amount of people who held watch parties or watched Clinton Cash with their family and friends during the weekend. Indeed, several comments have been posted on Breitbart. com and various social media platforms from people saying they and their friends and family were watching the Clinton Cash movie together in groups. It’s hard to know just how many millions of Americans may have tuned in to watch Clinton Cash during its   global release. As Breitbart News reported, the film was pushed heavily on social media by more than 283, 000     Bernie Sanders supporters, who helped catapult Clinton Cash to the top of Facebook’s trending topics list on Sunday. Due to overwhelming response and request, Breitbart News has decided to make Clinton Cash available for free forever by clicking here. Clinton Cash was directed by M. A. Taylor and was written and produced by Danny Fleurette and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon. The film exposes the alarming pattern of   speaking fees to Bill Clinton and donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign contributors, which coincided with favors for those closest to the Clintons and their foundation donors while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state.
