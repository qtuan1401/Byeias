Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is reportedly hoping the federal government —  specifically President Barack Obama’s administration —  will grab a stretch of land in Southern Nevada near the infamous Bundy Ranch, now that many in the Bundy group are in federal custody.  Now that ”most of (the Bundys) are in jail,” @SenatorReid says, he might want another POTUS monument call.

That standoff ended with the death of Lavoy Finicum and the arrest of both Ammon and Ryan Bundy.  Cliven Bundy was arrested soon after in the Portland airport while trying to join the Oregon occupation.    Senator Reid appears to be attacking the Bundy family and their supporters, who he previously called “domestic, violent terrorist wannabes” while adding to his legacy. Reid legacy watch:1. Bundy in jail. Check. 2. Once Bundy in jail, rub salt in by designating land near him as federal monument. Coming.  —   Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) April 6, 2016,
