 (CNN) A structure on the Taiwan set of an upcoming Martin Scorsese movie collapsed this week, killing a studio construction worker and injuring two more, Taipei police said. The workers were repairing a building used for scenery when it collapsed Thursday, police spokesman Chen   said.  Two men were  hospitalized, one in serious condition. Scorsese’s new feature, ”Silence,” tells the story of two Jesuit priests in 17th century Japan and the travails of Japanese Christians at the time, according to IMDb. The film is in   its publicist Leslee Dart said in a statement.  The production was concerned that the existing structure on the studio’s back lot was unsafe, and a   contractor was working to reinforce it when it fell. ”Everyone is in shock and sorrow, and expresses their deepest concern and sympathy to the families of the individual who died and those who were injured,” Dart said. Police will investigate to determine whether any laws were broken. There have been no arrests or charges.
