’   Sen. Elizabeth Warren was repeatedly heckled Monday night as she   delivered a speech endorsing Hillary Clinton at the Democratic   National Convention in Philadelphia. ’ ’   ”We trusted you! We trusted you!” factions of the audience   chanted. The hecklers were apparently made up of Bernie Sanders   supporters who were upset with Warren’’s endorsement of Clinton. ’ ’   Loud boos and jeers came soon after, when the Massachusetts   senator said it was imperative that Clinton and Tim Kaine, her   running mate, be elected to the White House. ’ ’ ’ ’Elizabeth Warren being booed   ’ ”   And toward the end of Warren’s speech, the more progressive   delegates began chanting again. ” ’   ”Goldman Sachs! Goldman Sachs!” portions of the crowd chanted. ’ ’   Chants of ”tax Wall Street” also came from the crowd. ’ ’ ’ ’Crowd chants ”Goldman Sachs” at Warren   ’ ’ ’ ’California Bernie delegates chanting ”Tax Wall Street!” over Elizabeth Warren, for some reason. ’ ”   While the audience was raucous at times during the progressive   firebrand’s address, it was far tamer than when the convention   was gaveled in during the afternoon. ” ’   The divide between Sanders and Clinton supporters deepened over   the weekend after emails published by WikiLeaks suggested that   top Democratic National Committee officials used the party   apparatus to  against the Vermont senator. ’ ’   As a result, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC chair, announced   that she would resign after the convention. ’
