For the second year in a row, nominations for the prestigious Hugo Awards for science fiction  fantasy have been swept by the Sad Puppies  Rabid Puppies, two groups of authors and fans who oppose   domination of the community. [The Sad Puppies were formed in 2013 by bestselling author Larry Correia, amidst growing domination of the Hugo Awards by   cliques  —   who, in 2012, successfully agitated for the cancellation of an appearance by British comedian Jonathan Ross at the awards due to fears that the entertainer might make a “ ” joke.  Correia, along with a number of other conservative and   authors, contended that a large chunk of Hugo voters voted on the basis of authors’ personal political beliefs rather than the quality of their writing. The Sad Puppies aimed to change that, by nominating authors on the basis of perceived quality rather than perceived politics. The Puppies have a particular opposition to “message fiction”  —   works that are primarily intended to convey a political message rather than tell a good story. Correia’s Sad Puppies, in 2015, were joined by the Rabid Puppies  —   a nominations slate organized by Theodore Beale (pen name Vox Day). At the time, Day summed up the goal of his campaign as follows: We value excellence in actual science fiction and fantasy, rather than excellence in intersectional equalitarianism, racial and gender inclusion, literary pyrotechnics, or professional rabbitology. That year, authors nominated by the Sad  Rabid Puppies campaigns swept several categories in the Hugo Awards, leading to outrage from progressive journalists and commentators. In an article that had to undergo several substantial corrections, pop culture news site Entertainment Weekly even accused the campaigns of being motivated by racism and sexism. This year, the Sad and Rabid Puppies have done it again. Ten out of fifteen Hugo Award categories have been completely dominated by   nominees  —   double what the campaigns achieved in 2015. The Puppies have also secured three out of five nominations for Best Novel, three out of four nominations for Best   Dramatic Presentation, and three out of five nominations for Best   Editor. In total, the Rabid Puppies swept six categories on their own, while a combination of Sad  Rabid puppy nominations swept a further four. Some of the Rabid Puppies nominations this year  —   such as a My Little Pony episode for Best   Dramatic Presentation and a porn parody in Best Short Story  —   seem clearly intended as troll options, a demonstration of the Puppies’ power to exert their will on the awards. Last year, progressives in   responded by denying any of the Puppy nominees an award. At the annual World Science Fiction Convention, where final votes are cast, attendees voted for the option of “No Award” in categories where   works had dominated. In all five   categories, “No Award” won  —   a record in the history of the awards. It remains to be seen if the same will happen in 2016, but it seems certain that this year’s Hugo Awards will be every bit as tumultuous as the last.
