Los Angeles (CNN) Music mogul Sean ”Diddy” Combs was arrested Monday, accused of assaulting someone with a kettlebell at the university where his son plays football.  No one was seriously injured in the incident at the Acosta Athletic Training Complex on the University of California at Los Angeles campus, which took place around 12:30 p. m. said school spokesman Phil Hampton. Officials did not disclose the alleged victim of the assault.  But TMZ, which first reported the story, said Combs scuffled with a coach during a practice session. Combs’ son Justin is a   defensive back on the school’s football team.  A representative for Combs called accounts of the incident ”wholly inaccurate.” ”Any actions taken by Mr. Combs were solely defensive in nature to protect himself and his son. We are confident that once the true facts are revealed, the case will be dismissed,” the representative said in a statement posted on Combs’ website Tuesday. In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Combs captioned a photo of himself and his son ”#FAMILYFIRST.” His son posted the same photo on his Instagram account, writing ”I thank God for having a father that’s always there for me.. Love you pops!” Combs was charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of making terrorist threats and one count of battery, the university said.  Bond was set at $160, 000, and Combs will have to appear in court on July 13, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said. ”I’m thankful that our staff showed the level of professionalism that they did in handling this situation,” UCLA football coach Jim Mora said in a statement. ”This is an unfortunate incident for all parties involved.” The coach said the school won’t be commenting further as it lets the ”the legal process run its course.”
