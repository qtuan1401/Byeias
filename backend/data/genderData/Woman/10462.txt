Saul Nunez, 19, was seen on video beating    Juan Llorens with a cane Friday until someone nearby intervened. Llorens suffered a bloody gash on his left ear that required stitches. Nunez ran off after the attack, but was arrested Saturday and charged with felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
