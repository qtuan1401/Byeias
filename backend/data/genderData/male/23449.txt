Forget Twitter fights. For a mere $10 per minute, Ceara Lynch will verbally abuse you on camera. [Lynch is a successful “humiliatrix,” pulling in no small amount of income by insulting men over the Internet. Her services aren’t limited to public   however. She’ll also sell you her “bathroom trash,” including  —   but not limited to  —   cups of her own urine.  “Just any sort of kind of disgusting item that could be harvested off my body I was able to sell,” she says. Stripping isn’t even a necessary part of the equation. While she does need to portray herself erotically, her focus is on catering to people who are more than interested enough in her feet alone. For a change of pace, she also entertains people with descriptive performances regarding “vore,” a fetish in which individuals fantasize about being literally eaten   digested. Ceara says that being her own boss is “priceless,” but her viewers are more than happy to put a price on her work. Still, she approaches it with a notably entrepreneurial spirit: “Nowadays, thanks to technology, a woman just needs a webcam and a computer and she can take control of her own life and make her own money. ” The Portland, Oregon native started at 17, when she began online dating. Since then, it has grown into a   career with a six figure salary. And in case you’re wondering, her dad fully approves. What a wondrous time to be alive.
