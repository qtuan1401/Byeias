 (CNN) Forgive the little girls in your life if they’re a little groggy this morning. They put in a late night watching history. Hillary Clinton’s the first female presidential nominee of a major political party. And when she accepted the Democrats’ nomination last night it was a thrilling moment, no matter what side of the political aisle you’re on. The chances of America having a female head of state for the first time in its   history are much closer to reality. So close that many parents let little girls across the country stay up late and soak in the historic moment.
