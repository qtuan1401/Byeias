 (CNN) Swiss artists Jojakim Cortis and Adrian Sonderegger play with history, creating 3D replicas of iconic photographs in their Zurich studio from cardboard, wood and glue. Read: Incredible paintings that actually breathe, For their ongoing Icons series    on show at Photo London this week    they ’remake’ important world events. Among their scenes is man’s first step on the moon, recreated from Edwin Aldrin’s 1969 image, and the Paris Concorde crash, as captured by Toshihiko Sato in 2000. Their final compositions reveal their conceit. Cortis and Sonderegger pull back the camera from their sculptures to show the surrounding studio and the accoutrements of their craft    glue, tape and cotton wool. Past and present intertwine, and the viewer is asked to question fact and fiction. Read: From selfies to virtual reality, how technology is changing the art world, ’One should not simply trust photography,’ Cortis explains. ’When there was no digital image processing, there was still a means to stage a picture or direct it in one way.’ The duo began the project as a joke in 2012. ’In our free time, when there’s no money coming in, we decided to try to recreate the most expensive pictures in the world,’ Cortis says. Now they’ve created a body of 50 images    nine of which are being shown at Photo London by   East Wing gallery    that will culminate in a 2018 book, published by Thames  Hudson.

Look closely and you’ll spot the wood grain that doubles for ripples on the sea, or the cotton wool used to evoke clouds. Photoshop work is restricted to colour adjustments only. Photo London runs until 21 May 2017 at Somerset House, London. For more art stories, head to The Spaces.
