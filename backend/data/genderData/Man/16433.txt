Bernie Sanders ( ) voted for the bill.  Clinton said, “May I answer? The crime bill, 1994, which you must be talking about, also contained a provision which no one ever mentions, which forbade   drug offenders from being covered by the excessive sentencing laws. Did you know that? I bet you didn’t. ” He added, “You don’t have anybody you can vote for who didn’t have anything to do with this.
