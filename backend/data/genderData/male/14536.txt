Websites that break their own rules are also subject to punishment by the Federal Trade Commission. However, websites do not have to obtain   consent from users before using their browsing history to show targeted ads. Many lobbyists are attempting to block this new rule. The Internet Association, whose founding members include Google and Facebook and represent companies such as Amazon, Dropbox, eBay, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Reddit, Spotify, and Twitter, issued a statement yesterday saying, “This bill has the potential to upend the consumer experience online and stifle innovation. Policymakers must recognize that websites and apps continue to be under strict FTC privacy enforcement and are not in an enforcement gap, unlike other stakeholders in the ecosystem. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
