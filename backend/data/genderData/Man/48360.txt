’  ’ ’   Iowa had a long punt return called back early in their game   against Miami (Ohio) and replays made it clear that an ugly hit   on one block was the reason. ’ ”   Josey Jewell, a junior linebacker and captain for Iowa, was   coming back toward the play on the punt return when he tried to   block Miami’s Matt Merimee. Instead, Jewell caught him with a   vicious    hit that appeared to knock Merimee   . ” ’   WARNING: This video may be considered disturbing by some viewers. ’ ’ ’ ’   Jewell was ejected for targeting on the play. Merimee appeared to   be momentarily unconscious, but he did get up and walk off the   field with some help. ’ ’   On the one hand, it does look like Jewell is trying to hit   Merimee with his shoulder and that Merimee tripped before contact   causing his own head to lower into the line of fire. But at the   same time, Jewell does lead with his helmet against a defenseless   player, and that is exactly the type of move that the NCAA is   trying to eliminate.  ’ ’   The play may not have been intentional, but it was as dangerous   as it gets and the ejection was warranted. ’
