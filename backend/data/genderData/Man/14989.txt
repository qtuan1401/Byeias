Thursday on CNN’s “The Lead,” Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said even after Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s ( ) failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act there was still a “70 percent, 75 percent chance that we still do get repeal of Obamacare. ”  Paul said, “I think the Freedom Caucus is doing what is best for America. They’re very principled and honorable men. I think that we’re trying to also let Republicans know if we pass something bad, if insurance rates are going up at 20 percent, 25 percent a year from now after Republicans have taken ownership of health care, that won’t be good for the party. It is also just not good for the country. ” “We do want insurance rates to go down,” he added. “We want more people to have insurance at a lower cost, and I’m still talking to the White House. I am still talking to the Freedom Caucus. I am talking to anybody that will listen, and I do still think  —   I think 70 percent, 75 percent chance that we still do get repeal of Obamacare, that we are going to find a good meeting place at some point. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
