CHARLOTTE, N. C. (AP)  —   For a fourth night, there are protests in Charlotte over the fatal shooting of a black man by a police officer. [Demonstrators gathered at a park and then marched into the business district. One had a banner that said “Just Release the Tapes. ”  Protesters have sought the release of police footage of the shooting earlier this week of Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer. Hillary Clinton’s campaign says she has decided to postpone her planned trip to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Sunday after hearing from community leaders. Clinton announced earlier Friday that she would travel to Charlotte in the aftermath of the shooting of a black man by a Charlotte police officer. But Clinton’s campaign now says that after further discussions with community leaders, the Democratic presidential nominee will postpone the trip to avoid straining the city’s resources. Clinton’s decision came after Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts told CNN that Clinton should postpone her visit because the city’s security resources were stretched thin. Clinton now plans to visit Charlotte on Sunday, October 2. Meanwhile in Atlanta, hundreds marched in an NAACP protest against police shootings. Marchers took to the streets after a rally at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights museum Friday evening. Many held signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and chanted “We’re ready, we’re ready for y’all. ” NAACP state President Francys Johnson and lawyer Mawuli Mel Davis led the protest. No police were present, but volunteers walked ahead of demonstrators and blocked off intersections for marchers. The peaceful march in Atlanta comes after Scott was fatally shot by an officer in Charlotte. In Oklahoma,    Terence Crutcher was shot to death by Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby. Shelby is charged with   manslaughter.
