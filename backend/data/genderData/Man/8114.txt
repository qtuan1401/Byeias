Thursday at the White House press briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer rebuked New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush for yelling out a question.  When Thrush tried to shout out a question Spicer said, “Glenn, this isn’t a TV program   …     OK? You don’t get to just yell out questions. We’re going to raise our hands like big boys and girls. Because it’s not your job to just yell out questions. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
