During Monday night’s   game, a young fan ran on the court and hugged Knicks star forward Carmelo Anthony.  Anthony handled it well, giving the kid a nice pat on the head. The kid then casually ran back to the stands, seemingly without getting in any backlash. “I was shocked. I didn’t really know who was it until I actually looked over and saw that it was a kid. ” Anthony told ESPN. “Definitely a security issue, though, for sure. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
