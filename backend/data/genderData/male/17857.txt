Two women confronted in a San Bernardino Stater Bros. Market for allegedly shoplifting were caught on camera fighting with store employees trying to recover the merchandise. [According to CBS 2, store managers say the two shoplifting suspects “tried to fight their way out of [the store]” once confronted.  Stater Bros. released a statement, which said, “While one suspect was removing the unpaid merchandise from her bag, the other suspect struck our female employee in the face with a closed fist and then grabbed her by the hair and pulled her to the ground. ”  Video of the incident appears to show one of the suspects holding on to the hair of a Stater Bros. employee.  The video was shot by witnesses who claim Stater Bros. employees were too rough on the suspects. But Stater Bros. begs to differ they say their employees “were only trying to protect the safety of the staff and customers and that the two accused of shoplifting instigated the fight. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
