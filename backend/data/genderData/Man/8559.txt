MSNBC “AM Joy” host Joy Reid reacted Saturday to House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise’s ( ) shooting, calling it a “delicate” situation because she hopes he recovers but added she cannot ignore his history regarding race,   marriage and gun control.  “[I]t’s a delicate thing because everybody is wishing the congressman well and hoping that he recovers, but Steve Scalise has a history that we’ve all been forced to sort of ignore on race,” Reid said. “He did come to leadership after some controversy over attending a white nationalist event, which he says he didn’t know what it was. He also   a bill to amend the Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. He voted for the House healthcare bill, which as you said would gut health care for millions of people, including three million children, and he   a bill to repeal the ban on   weapons. Because he is in jeopardy and everybody is pulling for him, are we required in a moral sense to put that aside at the moment?” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
