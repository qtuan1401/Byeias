The San Diego Padres broke a slump. Trevor Story continued a streak. [The Colorado Rockies rookie hit a home run in his fourth consecutive game. Story hit a   blast in the fourth and added a solo shot in the ninth, giving him six home runs for the first four games of his career. He also hit a single in the contest.  The Denver Post points out that Story joins Willie Mays, Mark McGwire, Nelson Cruz, and Chris Davis as the only players to start a season with home runs in each of a season’s first four games. No rookie had ever achieved the feat until now.  Story’s   heroics currently put him on pace to hit 243 round trippers on the season. Perhaps he cools down and settles for 74. MLB. com’s fantasy projection offers a similarly, seemingly    forecast for him, albeit of the    variety, to hit just 17 on the year. “I’m just trying to have a clear mind up there and compete with my eyes,” Story told reporters. “I know there will be ups and downs. When I’m going good, this is what it is. ” But the Padres spoiled the Coors Field home opener by exploding for 18 hits and 13 runs after setting an MLB record by putting no runs on the board in the first three games of the season against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The   victory marks the first in the managerial career of Andy Green. And Trevor Story’s accomplishment marks a first, too. We’ve watched this story before. It’s called The Natural, with Robert Redford playing Roy Hobbs Trevor Story.
