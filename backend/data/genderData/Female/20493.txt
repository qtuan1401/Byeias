During the CBS debate tonight, Wall Street Journal moderator Kim Strassel challenged Marco Rubio on his tax plan that would triple the Child Tax Credit suggesting it was social engineering. [But Rubio responded by reminding the audience that their tax money was “their money. ”  “This is the money of parents. You don’t earn the tax credit unless you’re working,” he said. “That’s your money, it doesn’t belong to government. ” Rubio argued that if businesses were allowed to take tax credits for investing in their business with a piece of equipment, families should earn the same benefit. “Family formation is the most important thing in society   …     parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the government’s money to invest in their children to go to school, to go a private school, to buy a new back pack. ” Rubio closed by explaining why it was important to invest in families. “I’m going to have a tax plan that is   because the family is the most important institution in society,” he said. “You cannot have a strong country without strong families. ”
