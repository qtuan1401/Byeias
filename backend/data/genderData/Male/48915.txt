’  ’ ’   On Thursday night, an Oklahoma high school team won a game with a     conversion in the final seconds that included the   quarterback completing a pass to himself, a lateral, and a   defender helping a runner juke five other defenders. ’ ’   The wackiness started when Sand Springs, in the white jerseys,   scored a touchdown with six seconds to play, .

Rather than go for an   extra point and force overtime, the team elected to go for two   and the win. ’ ’   Sand Springs quarterback Hunter Greathouse took the snap and   tried to throw to a wide receiver on a quick slant. However, the   ball was batted straight up into the air.
