’  ’ ”   The U. S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it has   approved Egalet Corp’s   opioid painkiller, Arymo ER. ” ’   The decision follows the recommendation of an independent panel   of advisors to the FDA, which in August voted   in favor of   approval. The panel recommended the drug be labeled as an     product. ’ ”   The FDA did not immediately say whether it has granted the     label. Egalet’s shares were halted pending news   after rising 15 percent to $9. 12 earlier in the day. ” ’   The abuse of opioids, a class of drugs that include heroin and   prescription painkillers, has reached epidemic proportions in the   United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   estimates that 78 Americans die every day from an opioid   overdose. ’ ’   Arymo ER is a   variation of morphine that is intended   to treat pain severe enough to require daily,        opioid treatment. It comes in the form of a very hard   pill that is difficult to crush and otherwise manipulate by   people looking to abuse the product.       Chewing, crushing, dissolving and injecting opioids can increase   the speed with which the drugs get into the bloodstream and   deliver the   high. ’ ’   Lawmakers across the United States are seeking ways to stem the   epidemic and the FDA is trying to encourage the development of     opioid formulations. The same advisory panel also   recommended that the FDA approve a   opioid made by   Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Vantrela ER.  ’
