’  ’ ’   Some iPhone 7 users have found an annoying glitch with the wired   Lightning EarPods that come with the iPhone 7. ’ ”   The issue, which I’ve also experienced a few times while testing   the iPhone 7, happens after you’ve left the EarPods plugged into   the iPhone 7’s Lightning port for a few minutes. Audio continues   to play, but the volume control dongle stops working, meaning you   can’t adjust the volume, activate Siri, or answer calls. ” ”   It’s unclear if the problem affects   Lightning   headphones. ” ”   The glitch doesn’t happen every time. It’s seemingly intermittent   and random. (I thought I was going crazy until I saw some people   with similar issues .) If you experience the problem, you can just   unplug your EarPods and plug them in again to temporarily fix it. ” ’   An Apple spokesperson told me the problem will be fixed in a   future software update. ’ ”   Apple removed the standard headphone jack in the iPhone 7 in   favor of wireless headphones or headphones that plug into the   Lightning port. However, the Lightning port is a more advanced   kind of plug, and it’s partially controlled by software. So   if there’s a bug with the software like there is in this case,   your headphones might not always work properly. ”
