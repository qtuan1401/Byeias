Author  filmmaker Trevor Loudon told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Monday that if Hillary Clinton is elected, “there will never be another Republican president, ever, or anyone other than a Democrat. ”[“You’ll have, effectively, a   state in America,” added Loudon.  He was basing his belief on Clinton’s promise for amnesty in the first   days of any administration. “She has promised within   days of assuming office to legalize all of the illegal immigrants in the United States. Now, that’s anywhere between 12 and 50 million people. We know from past patterns that they will vote from 75 to 80 percent Democrat,” said Loudon. Others have expressed similar sentiments. Loudon also discussed his new movie, The Enemies Within. See the trailer below: Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
