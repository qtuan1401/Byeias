On Breitbart News Sunday, Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle and a series of   national security experts will provide the first   look   at what happened in Orlando —  and more importantly, why.  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whistleblower Philip Haney will open the show and break down the entire breakdown in law enforcement’s ability to effectively use intelligence to cover.   agent John Guandolo will talk about the Muslim Brotherhood as will Pamela Geller. Kim Jensen, a former FBI counterterrorism center instructor, will break down what has happened on that front. And Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning will explain how the institutional left has sought to distract by blaming the Second Amendment instead of radical Islamic terrorism.
