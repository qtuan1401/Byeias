After a penalty gave Central Michigan an untimed down as the last play of the game, CMU quarterback Cooper Rush threw up a hail mary to wide receiver Jesse Kroll. Kroll caught the ball around the 10 yard line and then lateraled the ball back to Corey Willis. Willis then ran around defenders and into the end zone to lead the Chippewas to a   victory over the Cowboys. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
