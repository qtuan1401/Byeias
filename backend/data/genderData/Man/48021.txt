’  ’ ’   SAN FRANCISCO  —   A    man was shot to death while playing   ”Pokémon Go” at a tourist attraction along San Francisco’’s   waterfront, authorities and a family friend said on Sunday. ’ ’   Calvin Riley was shot Saturday night by an unknown assailant at   Aquatic Park near Ghirardelli Square, the US Park Police said. ’ ’   A family friend told   that Riley and a friend were playing   the hit mobile game when he was shot. ’ ’   ”From what we know there was no confrontation,” John Kirby said.   ”There was nothing said back and forth. It was just senseless,   just came up and shot in the back and ran away for nothing.” ’ ’   Kirby said Riley and his friend had noticed someone watching them   from the top of a hill that overlooks the park, but it was dark   and they were mostly looking at their cellphones. ’ ’’ ”   National Park Service spokesman Lynn Cullivan said investigators   believe there are witnesses to the attack because it happened in   the bustling Fisherman’s Wharf area. They are seeking tips. ” ”   Sgt. Robert Jansing, a detective with the US Park Police, said   the gunman did not take any of Riley’s belongings or try to rob   him. ” ’   It was unclear whether the attack had anything to do with   ”Pokmon Go,” which has become a national sensation   this summer as legions of fans visit   landmarks to find   and trap cartoon creatures. ’ ”   But the game’s popularity has created unintended consequences in   everyday life. Property owners complain of players trespassing or   damaging their grounds, and scores of players have been injured   or robbed as they stare at their phones in search of digital   monsters. ” ”     officials have warned about the game’s possible   dangers, saying players can become engrossed in the game and tune   out their surroundings. ”
