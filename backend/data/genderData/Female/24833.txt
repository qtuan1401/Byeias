A    boy in Sri Lanka allegedly hacked the website of the country’s president in order to demand a change to his exam schedule and has been arrested, the BBC reports. [The hack was reportedly carried out last week after the boy became frustrated with Sri Lanka’s exam schedule, with exams being held in April during both the Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations.  Using the pseudonym of the hacking group “The Sri Lanka Youth,” he allegedly demanded that, as well as the exams being rescheduled, president Maithripala Sirisena should “take care of the security of Sri Lankan websites or face a cyber war. ” He also warned the president to “stop the prime minister’s irresponsible work and look more into the problems of the university students. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
