HOUSTON, Texas  —   Micah X. Johnson was a member of the Houston New Black Panther Party for a short period of time. He was reported to be a member for about six months a few years ago. [Quanell X told reporters at KPRC NBC2 in Houston that Johnson was a member of the Houston Chapter of the New Black Panther Party for a short time a few years ago. He said he parted ways with Johnson after about six months because Johnson would not follow the chain of command.  During negotiations with the Dallas Police Department Friday morning during the ambush shooting that left five officers dead and seven other people shot, Johnson said he was not part of any group. He stated he wanted to kill white people and white police officers. As head of the Houston Chapter, Quanell X said Johnson was only a member for about six months. He did not say when that affiliation began or ended. Breitbart Texas has reached out to Quanell X for clarification. No response was immediately available.  Breitbart Texas was present at an armed march carried out by the Houston New Black Panther Party in Waller County last summer. This writer took photos and video of the armed marchers at that time. One of the members holding an   style rifle appears to be Micah Xavier Johnson. During the march, the armed members of the New Black Panther Party stood off against Harris County Sheriff’s Deputies who came to Waller County responding to a request for assistance from Sheriff Glenn Smith. This writer stood between the protesters and the deputies to take these photos and video. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
