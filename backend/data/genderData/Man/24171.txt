It also says members of the mob slapped her, pinned her down and repeatedly beat her, while unknown men recorded the beatdown on camera. The victim was treated for serious injuries, including a concussion and lacerations. “One’s kicking her, and she’s completely helpless. It’s just really hard to watch,” friend of the victim Ramy Williams said. “The other one was just wailing on her face, wailing on her head, you know, on the back of her head. It definitely could have killed her. ” The victim is reportedly doing better physically, but not emotionally. She said the attack on her was unprovoked, but she knows who the suspects are. The report says they have had problems in the past. Follow Breitbart. TV on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
