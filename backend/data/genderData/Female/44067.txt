’  ’ ’   Instagram star Joe Wicks, or ”The Body Coach” as he is known to   his followers, has built a fitness empire on showing people how   to get ”Lean in 15.” ’ ’   The concept is based on   recipes, which he shares   through quick and snappy Instagram videos, which are tasty, easy   to put together, yet part of a diet plan that he credits for his   own fit lifestyle. ’ ’   His diet is quite flexible, as his own personal regime and the     fitness and nutrition plans he sells  —   from which he makes   the majority of the money for his business  —   are also heavily   focused on exercise. ’ ’   His series of books feature recipes such as chicken carbonara,   pies, curries, and scotch eggs, and Wicks is often seen treating   himself on Instagram and Snapchat to treats and the odd gin and   tonic. But despite his belief in balance, there are some foods   that he would never touch. ’ ’ ”Frozen ready meals,” he told Business Insider, when we   asked him for the one food that’’s so unhealthy, he would never   eat it. ’ ’’ ’   He added that he also avoids fast food chains. ”Any deep fried   stuff. It’’s the oils they use that aren’’t food for you, rather   than [whatever is in them, like] the chicken. They’’re cheap, so   they use all sorts of crap.” ’ ’   Instead, if Wicks has a craving, he’’ll try to create a healthier   version at home. ”I like to make healthy versions of popcorn   chicken, healthy burgers, and healthy homemade pizzas, so I never   feel deprived,” he said. ’ ’Instagram star Joe Wicks, or ”The Body Coach”. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
