On the Saturday broadcast of MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” John Jay College Professor of Law and Police Studies Eugene O’Donnell reacted to the Dallas attack by pointing to the combination of mental illness and “this sick gun culture we have” for the death of five police officers and injuries to several more in Dallas.  “I think it’s pretty clear you have somebody here with a mental health issue, and that is lethal combination with this sick gun culture we have, where guns are so readily available. You have the capacity for ordinary people to bring war to downtown Dallas,” O’Donnell said. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
