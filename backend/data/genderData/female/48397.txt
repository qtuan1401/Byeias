’The ”Hamptons Effect” has little to do with the housing market or even with the Hamptons.’ ”Instead, Stifel’s Christopher Growe and his colleagues use the term to describe the fact that  tend to rally into the final trimester of the year.” ’They coined the term because the timing of the rally coincides with the  when many Wall Streeters are back from vacations and Labor Day breaks in the Hamptons.’ ’Investors have historically piled into food stocks late in the year to ”in part help sustain portfolio returns with defensive and consistent performers,” Growe explained in a note on Monday.’ ’He continued (emphasis added):’ ’They are being lifted by strong earnings growth due to cost savings, high dividend yields, and the continued potential for mergers and acquisitions, Growe said.’ ’’ ’”On an absolute basis, May, October, November, and December are the best months to own food stocks with the majority of stocks outperforming in these months,” Growe wrote.’ ’Growe added that the group trades at a 30% premium to the market, which is well above its historical average.’ ’Stocks that Stifel rate ”buy” include General Mills, Kraft Heinz, and TreeHouse Foods.’ ’Get updates in your inbox.’ ’Subscribe to Markets Chart Of The Day and never miss an update!’
