President Barack Obama said Iran was following the letter of the nuclear deal with the United States and the rest of the world, but suggested they could do more to follow the “spirit” of the agreement. [“Iran so far has followed the letter of the agreement, but the spirit of the agreement involves Iran also sending signals to the world community and business that it is not going to be engaging in a range of provocative actions that may scare business off,” Obama said during a press conference today after the Nuclear Security Summit with world leaders today in Washington D. C.  Obama referred to Iran launching ballistic missiles, repeating calls for the destruction of Israel, and shipping missiles to Hezbollah as examples of Iran’s failures to follow the “spirit” of the deal. “That gets businesses nervous,” he said. Obama complained that both the United States and Iran had hardliners who were determined that the nuclear deal between the two countries would fail. He insisted that the deal was a “game changer” in spite of recent criticisms that Iran was ignoring their end of the deal. “So long as Iran is carrying out its end of the bargain, we think it’s important for the world community to carry out our end,” Obama said.
