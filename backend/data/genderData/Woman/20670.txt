It’s now been 261 days since Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held a press conference. Clinton has nothing on her public schedule until August 25, an “organizing event” in Reno, Nevada. [Why the Clinton campaign is #HidingHillary is the subject of much speculation, but an associate professor at City University of New York’s Graduate School of Journalism, Jeff Jarvis, isn’t blaming Clinton’s health or her inability to honestly answer unscripted questions about her many scandals. No, Jarvis blames the media for #HidingHillary because the press would be “falling over themselves to show how tough they can be. ”  Imagine the shitshow that a Clinton presser would be   falling over themselves to show how tough they can be. Blame her for passing?  —   Jeff Jarvis (@jeffjarvis) August 21, 2016,  With professors like Jarvis shaping impressionable minds, it’s no wonder so much of the media exhibits liberal bias.
