While campaigning for his wife Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in North Carolina, former president Bill Clinton listed the problems with the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare.  Clinton said, “He just said ‘I want to repeal this law and trust me on the rest.’ One of the problems with a law, we can all tick them off, right? The copays, deductibles and premiums are too high, and the drug prices are too high. So what does she say we should do? We should bargain for lower drug prices, the way that government can’t now with Medicare and Medicaid for everybody. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
