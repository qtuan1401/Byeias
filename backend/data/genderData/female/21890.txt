A man suspected of being an illegal alien has been arrested and charged with aggravated sexual assault. His victim is reported to be a    girl. [The victim’s mother told police she observed her daughter “walking funny,” according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the San Antonio Express News. The young girl told her mother that Carlos Esparza had hurt her.  The arrest affidavit details the multiple assaults the man allegedly carried out on his victim. The girl’s mother had put her to bed, but the girl and her siblings went downstairs to watch television. The affidavit states that Esparza was laying on the couch under a blanket. He is reported to have picked up the girl and placed her on his lap. After he removed their clothes, he sexually assaulted her in several ways, according to the affidavit. He told the girl to keep his actions secret. San Antonio police officials told the San Antonio newspaper that Esparza is believed to be in the United States illegally. They expressed concern that Esparza could easily leave the country. He reportedly has a criminal history that includes aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and arrests for narcotics violations. The affidavit states that Esparza told the girl that if she revealed their secret he would not come over anymore. It further states that his sexual contact with the child was harmful to her mental and emotional welfare. Breitbart Texas reached out to the San Antonio Police Department for additional information including Esparza’s complete criminal history, immigration status, and if he had been previously deported. A response from the department was immediately available. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
