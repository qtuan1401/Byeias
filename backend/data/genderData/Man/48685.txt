’  ’ ’   California Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed a bill to end the   statute of limitations for rape, a measure inspired by   accusations against comedian Bill Cosby, some of which surfaced   decades after alleged crimes occurred. ’ ’   Cosby, who built a long career on family friendly comedy,   including his   NBC sitcom ”The Cosby Show,” has   steadfastly denied ever assaulting anyone and has insisted that   all his sexual encounters were consensual. ’ ’   He is charged in Pennsylvania with drugging and sexually   assaulting a former Temple University employee, Andrea Constand,   at his home in 2004. In California, he faces a civil suit by a   woman now in her 50s who alleges that Cosby plied her with   alcohol and molested her in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she   was aged 15. ’ ’  ’
