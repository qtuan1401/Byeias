“Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” the popular Sunday night talk radio show, has once again been ranked among the annual list of 50    talk radio shows streamed on the Internet. [The program is hosted by Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter Aaron Klein.  Klein made the “Power 50” list of Talk Stream Live, which was released on Monday and drew from a sample of 11. 6 million Internet listener sessions during 2016 to compile the listing of “The 50 Most Influential and Most   Streaming Talk Show Hosts. ” Breitbart News Daily, broadcast daily on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern and hosted by Breitbart    Alex Marlow, was not ranked by Talk Stream Live since the satellite radio show does not stream live on the Internet. Radio giant Michael Savage came in at number one on the “Power 50” list, evidencing Savage’s enormous following among Internet listeners in addition to his top terrestrial radio ratings. Klein’s program, broadcast on terrestrial radio on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia, came in at No. 40 on the Internet “power” rankings. The rating is particularly noteworthy since Klein’s weekend broadcast airs only once per week for two hours.  His weekend program beat out major national shows that broadcast three hours a day, five days a week. Klein also consistently makes the radio industry’s highly coveted Talkers’ “Heavy Hundred. ” Here is the full Talk Stream Live “Power 50” list of Internet ratings for 2016: Rank   Show1 Michael Savage2 Rush Limbaugh3 Laura Ingraham4 Sean Hannity5 Mark Levin6 Glenn Beck7 Hugh Hewitt8 Alex Jones9 Howie Carr10 George Noory11 Tammy Bruce12 Mike Gallagher13 Dennis Prager14 Herman Cain15 Red Eye Radio16 John Batchelor17 Clyde Lewis18 IMUS19 The Dana Show20 Chris Plante21 Michael Medved22 Larry Kudlow23 Larry Elder24 The Power Hour25 Jeff Kuhner26 Bill Cunningham27 Lars Larson28 Steve Deace29 Jimmy Church30 Jesse Lee Peterson31 Kim Komando32 America’s Morning News33 Joe Pags34 Bob Brinker35 Dave Ramsey36 Brian Sussman37 Phil Valentine38 Heather Wade39 Texas Overnight40 Aaron Klein41 Joe Piscopo42 Agenda 21 Radio43 Brian Kilmeade44 Leo Laporte45 Jim Bohannon46 Dr. Michio Kaku47 Clark Howard48 Armstrong  Getty49 Robert Scott Bell50 Mark Davis,
