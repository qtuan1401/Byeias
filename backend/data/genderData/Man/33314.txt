 (CNN) Clean lines of buildings across the globe have been papped for a photography competition celebrating minimalist architecture. The Minimalist Architecture Mission, organized by blog We And The Color and photography resource EyeEm, received 45, 000 submissions from photographers around the world. Images range from architectural celebs, such as Zaha Hadid’s MAXXI in Rome, to details of more anonymous buildings, often featuring sharp angles, and contrasting patterns and colors. We And The Color selected a shortlist of 20 winners, with German photographer Matthias Heiderich    who’s no stranger to snapping buildings himself    picking the top three.  Georgij Dorofeev’s snap of a   façade, set against a bright blue sky, scooped first place. Read: Architects imagine the cities of the future, Trynidada’s photograph of the MAXXI, reflecting its neighboring buildings, came second.  Meanwhile Urban Poetry’s image of a sinuous steel bridge under a single puff of cloud, took third. ”What I love about this kind of photography is that sometimes it’s hard to tell whether I’m looking at a photograph or a   image,” says Heiderich. ”But the subtleties make the difference.”  See more architectural photography on The Spaces.
