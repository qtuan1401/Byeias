”At last week’s F8 developer conference, .” ”Here’s that slide, in case you missed it: ” ’’ ”Zuckerberg’s intention here was to show Facebook’s   gameplan in action: First, you take a neat   technology. Then, you build a product based on it. Then, you turn it into an ecosystem where developers and outside companies can use that technology to build their own businesses.” ’Maybe I’’m weird, though, because I looked at this slide and said ”okay. ..then what happens? ”’ ”Facebook is too busy with the short term to provide handy answers. But we can use this to piece together a vision of what Facebook thinks the world will look like in ten years. It’s a cool, crazy ambitious vision with a ton of upside. But it also means handing over unprecedented control of your life to Facebook.” ”On Facebook’s planet of 2026, the entire world has internet access  —   with many people likely getting it . Similarly, Facebook thinks we’ll be wearing virtual reality headsets that will be less   and more like your normal everyday glasses, Zuckerberg promises. Finally, artificial intelligence will be good enough that we can talk to computers like humans.” ’’ ”Just try to picture what this looks like, especially through Facebook’s lens of bringing people together.

That could be in store, with the evolution of Facebook Messenger’s chatbot technology.” ”Today, . But using natural human speech, as you’re supposed to do with chatbots, is also the best way to interact with any device that doesn’t have a keyboard or mouse  —   the  design. And as artificial intelligence improves, they’ll understand us a lot better.” ”If we’re all living in this kind of   world, it makes Facebook key to every interaction, and crucially, every financial transaction we conduct in that sphere. ” ”It’s cool, certainly. Mainstream virtual reality is still a little ways off, but it’s coming, and it’s going to be awesome. But it also potentially gives Facebook a frightening level of control over everything we see, hear, and buy. Given that the social network already wields a lot of influence over everything from advertising to politics, the next 10 years are going to raise some tough questions for Facebook and its role in our lives. ” ”At last week’s F8 developer conference, Mark. ..”
