On February 26 CVS manager Joe Morici was fired after pursuing then disarming robbery suspects who allegedly attacked him with a large screwdriver. [The CVS store is located in Beltsville, Maryland.  According to Fox 25, Morici said he saw “two individuals  …    jumping the counter into [the] pharmacy” on Friday. Police confirmed, saying the suspects “took narcotics from the pharmacy’s safe. ” Morici spent seven years in the military, including a year in Afghanistan as “a sergeant in a medivac unit. ” He said he his military training kicked in when he “[feared] for the safety of his customers and ” so he pursued the two suspects and caught them at the front door. At that point he said one of the suspects allegedly attacked him with a large screwdriver. Morici said, “He tried to hit me again with the screwdriver. I disarmed him of the screwdriver, while having the other guy pinned against the one door. ” Morici was able to “retrieve most  …    of the stolen pills during the struggle,” and the suspects managed to escape. Even so, as customers and his fellow employees lauded his actions, but CVS fired him later that very day. CVS released a statement of   regarding Morici’s termination: In the unfortunate event of a robbery at one of our stores, the safety and   of our customers and employees is always our highest priority. We do not comment on specific security policies as we do not want to undermine them. And due to our employment privacy policies, we are unable to comment on Mr. Morici. For his part, Morici feared he would be fired for taking action instead of offering passive compliance, but he said, “I acted in the way that was right and I still stand by that. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
