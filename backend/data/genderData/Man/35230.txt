 (CNN) The Portland man accused of stabbing three men who were defending two young women on a light rail train has been indicted on 15 charges, including counts related to an alleged incident the day before. Jeremy Christian faces state charges of aggravated murder (two counts) attempted murder,   assault,   assault,   intimidation (three counts) menacing (two counts) and unlawful use of a weapon (five counts). Four charges are in connection with an incident the day before the May 26 stabbings, the indictment says.  After boarding a MAX light rail train May 26, Christian went on a tirade directed at two   teenagers, one who was wearing a traditional Muslim hijab, according to witnesses and a police affidavit. Police said the attacker slashed the throats of Ricky Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin   23, as they tried to defend the girls, killing them. A third man, Micah Fletcher, 21, was seriously injured. All three men have been hailed as heroes. Christian was arraigned last week and yelled as he walked into the courtroom, saying: ”Get out if you don’t like free speech!” and ”You call it terrorism I call it patriotism. You hear me? Die.” His next court appearance is set for Wednesday morning.  Christian said at his arraignment that he was transient and ”does not know the last time he had a permanent address.” Court documents from previous years show he lived with his parents.
