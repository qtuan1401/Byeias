LANGUAGE WARNING]  Per a Fox 59 report, a woman at a Florida Target confronted a man who she recognized from a previous creepy encounter. Candice Spivey says she was at Target when a man started approached her and started asking inappropriate questions. That is when she realized she had met the very same guy two years ago. “At first he is very believable. At first he comes up and seems like he genuinely need your help in regards of answering questions about a dress he bought for his wife,” Spivey said. She took out her phone once the man’s questions got to be about her undergarments and body. In the video, Spivey says to the man, ““Do you remember running into me at the grocery store? Hey you  —   where you going? Come back!” The man, later identified as Jeffrey Polizzi, took off and fled the store while Spivey asked for help to stop him. She chased him out into the parking lot, where he ran to his car and drove off. After the encounter with Spivey, Polizzi was arrested for reckless driving. Since Spivey’s video made its way around the Internet, 50 women have spoken with investigators about their experiences with Polizzi. Polizzi was reportedly arrested in 2009 on charges of video voyeurism and criminal mischief, which he pleaded no contest. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
