Stony Brook University Police have released a photo of a Hispanic man they are looking for in connection with a groping incident in a school bathroom, reports say. [University police chief Robert J. Lenahan told the media his officers conducted a search of the campus grounds for the man but were unable to find him.  The suspect, identified as Miguel Angel Condori, 33, accosted a female student on Saturday on the third floor of the Behavioral Sciences building of the Long Island campus, Lenahan reported. The chief also said he intended to station university police at strategic locations around the university in case Condori reappears. The university is stepping up its response to this incident after being accused earlier this year of exhibiting “deliberate indifference” over the claims of a student who charged a male student with sexually assaulting her in January. The student clams she was drugged and sexually attacked in the male student’s dorm room but insists that she did not get justice from the university’s attempt to review her case. The woman’s chief complaint is that she was made to act as her own counsel during the adjudication of the case before the school and her attacker. She says she was not afforded adequate representation in the process as a result. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.
