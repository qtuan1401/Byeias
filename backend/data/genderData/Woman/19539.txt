Peter J. Kadzik, a Justice Department assistant attorney general, is helping lead the revisited FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. [“We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,” Kadzik wrote in a letter to Congress, reassuring Democrats that the Justice Department would work to resolve the situation.  Zero Hedge strings together Kadzik’s long standing relationship with Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta, beginning with his representation in the Monica Lewinsky case. “Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,” Podesta wrote in 2008, according to the Washington Free Beacon’s Lachlan Markay, recommending him to assist the Obama transition team vet potential candidates. As reported by the Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross, Podesta met with Kadzik for dinner the day after Hillary Clinton testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. It was one of several occasions that Podesta and Kadzik met socially during the election. Kadzik’s son also asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign, in an email sent in May 2015.
