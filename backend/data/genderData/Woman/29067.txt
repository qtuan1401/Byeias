With Al Gore by her side, Hillary Clinton channeled climate change alarmism into her speech in Florida, by blaming Hurricane Matthew on global warming. [“Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change right now,” she said, citing “record high” ocean temperatures.  She insisted that climate change “contributed” to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding in North and South Carolina. “Sea levels have risen one foot in much of the Southeast which means Matthew’s storm surge was higher and the flooding more severe,” she said ominously. It didn’t stop there. Clinton and Gore teamed up to warn that most of the destructive natural disasters in the past decade were a result of climate change. Global warming, Gore said, was creating the energy that was “equivalent to what would be released by 400, 000 Hiroshima class atomic bombs going off every day. ” Zika and Lyme disease were more threatening because summers lasted longer, they argued, allowing ticks and mosquitoes to live longer. “Every single night on the television news is like a major hike through the Book of Revelation,” Gore said. “You look at the floods and the droughts and the mudslides and the fires and the incredible downpours  …    ” Longer summers made it worse for children who suffered from allergies and asthma, Clinton said, and also caused more wildfires. Gore urged Floridians to vote for Hillary Clinton, because she would take climate change seriously. “Mother Nature is giving us a very clear and powerful message,” he said. “We cannot continue putting 110 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere every day as if it’s an open sewer. We’ve got to stop that. ”
