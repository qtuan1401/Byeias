 (CNN) Here’s what you need to know about anthrax, an acute infectious disease caused by bacterium Bacillus anthracis.  Facts:There are three types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin) inhalation (through the lungs the most deadly) and gastrointestinal (through digestion). There has been a fourth type of anthrax identified as injection anthrax. This is common in   users in northern Europe. This has never been reported in the United States.  It can be contracted by handling products from infected animals or by breathing in anthrax spores and by eating undercooked meat from infected animals.  Anthrax has been blamed for several plagues over the ages that killed both humans and livestock. It emerged in World War I as a biological weapon. The CDC categorizes anthrax as a Category A agent: one that poses the greatest possible threat for a negative impact on public health one that may spread across a large area or need public awareness and requires planning to protect the public’s health. Amerithrax:Five people died and 17 people sickened during anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 outbreak referred to as Amerithrax.  Anthrax was sent via anonymous letters to news agencies in Florida and New York and a congressional office building in Washington. Of the five victims who died of inhalation anthrax, two were postal workers. The other three victims were an elderly woman from rural Connecticut, a Manhattan hospital worker from the Bronx and an employee at a Florida tabloid magazine who may have contracted anthrax through  . The letters were sent to NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, Sen. Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Sen. Patrick Leahy, and the New York Post offices. The letters were postmarked Trenton, New Jersey. No arrests have been made in the attacks. The FBI has interviewed more than 9, 100 people and issued more than 6, 000 subpoenas in the case.  4. 8 million masks and 88 million gloves were purchased by the Postal Service for its employees, and 300 postal facilities were tested for anthrax. Over 32, 000 people took antibiotics after possible exposure to anthrax.

January 2002   FBI agents interview former U. S. Army bioweapons scientist Steven Hatfill as part of the anthrax investigation. June 2002   Bioweapons researcher Steven Hatfill is named a ”person of interest” by the FBI.  June 25, 2002   The FBI searches Steven Hatfill’s Maryland apartment and Florida storage locker with his consent. June 27, 2002   The FBI says it is focusing on 30 biological weapons experts in its probe. August 1, 2002   The FBI uses a criminal search warrant to search Steven Hatfill’s Maryland apartment and Florida storage locker a second time anthrax swab tests come back negative. August 6, 2002   Attorney General John Ashcroft refers to Hatfill as a ”person of interest.” August 11, 2002   Steven Hatfill holds a press conference declaring his innocence, and a second one on August 25, 2002. September 11, 2002   The FBI searches Hatfill’s former apartment in Maryland for the third time. August 26, 2003   Hatfill files a civil lawsuit against Attorney General John Ashcroft, the Justice Department and the FBI claiming his constitutional rights have been violated. The suit alleges violations of Hatfill’s Fifth Amendment rights by preventing him from earning a living, violations of his Fifth Amendment rights by retaliating against him after he sought to have his name cleared in the anthrax probe and the disclosure of information from his FBI file. The suit, which names the Justice Department, FBI, Attorney General John Ashcroft and various lower level Justice and FBI officials, asks for a declaration that government officials violated Hatfill’s constitutional rights and seeks an injunction against future violations. The suit also seeks an undetermined amount of monetary damages. July 11, 2004   The former headquarters of American Media, Inc. in Boca Raton, Florida, where Bob Stevens contracted the anthrax is pumped full of chlorine dioxide gas for decontamination. This was the last building exposed to anthrax in the fall of 2001. March 14, 2005   Pentagon officials announce that sensors have detected anthrax in two Pentagon mail facilities. The facilities have been closed and nearly 300 workers have been tested for exposure to the bacteria. June 27, 2008   The Justice Department reaches a settlement with former Army scientist Steven Hatfill. The settlement requires the Justice Department to pay Hatfill a   payment of $2. 825 million and to buy a $3 million annuity that will pay Hatfill $150, 000 a year for 20 years. In return, Hatfill drops his lawsuit, and the government admits no wrongdoing. July 29, 2008   Bruce Ivins, a former researcher at the Army’s bioweapons laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland, dies after overdosing during a suicide attempt on July 27.  August 6, 2008   Judge unseals and releases hundreds of documents in the 2001 FBI Anthrax investigation.  August 8, 2008   The Justice Department formally exonerates Hatfill.

Postal Inspection Service announce its investigation into the 2001 anthrax mailings is at an end. March 23, 2011   A report, entitled The Amerithrax Case, is released through the Research Strategies Network, a   think tank based in Virginia. According to the report, old mental health records suggest Bruce Ivins should have been prevented from holding a job at a U. S. Army research facility in Maryland. The report was requested by the U. S. Department of Justice. October 9, 2011   The New York Times reports indicate there are scientists questioning the FBI assertions regarding Bruce Ivins. Possibly Ivins, if he was involved, worked with a partner. Also, the scientists say the presence of tin in the dried anthrax warrants that the investigation be reopened. November 23, 2011   The Justice Department settles for $2. 5 million with the family of Bob Stevens, the first victim to die in the 2001 anthrax attack. The family originally sued for $50 million in 2003, arguing that the military laboratory should have had tighter security.

July 11, 2014   The CDC holds a news conference to discuss the conclusion of its investigation, and says that while it is ”not impossible” that the staff was exposed to viable B. anthracis (anthrax) it is ”extremely unlikely” that this happened. July 2016   Thirteen people are hospitalized amid an outbreak of anthrax in the   autonomous region of western Siberia. Experts with the Russian Ministry of Agriculture believe the cause of infection is the thawing of the frozen carcass of a reindeer that died 75 years ago. This is the first anthrax outbreak in the area since 1941.
