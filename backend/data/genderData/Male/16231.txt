This allows city officials to ban items within a certain distance of the game for security reasons. The Panthers decided to hold the game against the Vikings as planned after a meeting with NFL officials Thursday. “This offseason, we constructed four new security posts around the stadium to account for people coming onto the property,” team president Danny Morrison told ESPN. “There are now 95   magnetometers, which will be used in place of the wanding procedure for screening. Additionally, camera coverage and explosive detection canine teams have been enhanced. ”
