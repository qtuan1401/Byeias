”   An Apple patent  suggests that the   company is at least considering the idea of making an iPhone   that’s mostly glass. ” ’  ’ ’   The patent comes after  ’ ’   The patent describes an iPhone with rounded glass that wraps   around the side edges. It also details how the glass edges could   act as a ”mini flexible edge display” with customizable ”active   virtual buttons.” ’ ”   It potentially means that the side edges could have customizable   touch buttons for certain functions and shortcuts to features   like you’d find in the iPhone’s control center, such as opening   the camera app, turning on the flashlight, or music controls. ” ’  ’ ”   If that sounds familiar, then that’s because you’ve seen the    that was released in 2014, which had a   single curved glass edge that displayed information and could be   tapped to open functions and features. ” ’   Patently Apple also referred to a patent granted to Apple in 2013   that showed a very similar design concept: ’ ’  ’ ”   As pretty as an   iPhone might sound, it isn’t clear how   durable it would be, as the entire surface of the phone would   risk being cracked after hitting a hard surface from a relatively   low height. And case makers could potentially have a hard time   making a case for a phone where it’s entire front surface and   side edges are made of touch screens. ” ”   While patents filed by Apple seem more official than rumors,   they’re not indicators of what Apple has in store for future   products. The company has been granted plenty of patents   with new product ideas, but many of them have never seen the   light of day. ”
