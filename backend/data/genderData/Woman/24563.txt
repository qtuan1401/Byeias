On Friday’s broadcast of “MSNBC Live,” former Vermont Governor Howard Dean commented on his departure from the race to be DNC Chair by saying that the party needs a younger leader, and that he does not support Representative Keith Ellison’s ( ) candidacy.  Dean said he was dropping out because “I really feel strongly that our party needs to turn itself over to the next generation, and I’m very happy to stay in the background and help coach the  —   whoever the chair is. I just think that one of the problems that we had in this election was, we’ve got to connect more with young people, and that means not having faces like mine. ” He added that it was “better” to have someone young running the party. Dean continued by praising South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley, but added that other people might join in, and he may or may not endorse someone. When asked about Ellison, Dean answered, “I do not support Keith as long as he has his Congressional seat. ” He added that he might support Ellison later, but doesn’t now.
