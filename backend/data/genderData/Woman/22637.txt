MSNBC contributor Toure reacted to comments made by Fox News Channel host Bill O’Reilly regarding how   care of the slaves who helped build the White House were, in response to first lady Michelle Obama’s speech that discussed how slaves built the White House.  Toure said Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy” that slavery continues to have an impact on the structure and nature of the United States. “[Slavery] continues to have an impact on our lives and is the structure and nature of the country. I understand that these folks don’t want slavery to be discussed anymore. It would make their lives better if it wasn’t discussed. Just stop talking about it. So often for Conservatives, talking about race equals racism. And that is the problem,” Toure told MSNBC’s Joy Reid. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
