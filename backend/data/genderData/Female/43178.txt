’  ’ ’   One morning in late 2015, on Sears’’ vast Illinois campus, more   than a dozen employees huddled in a videoconference room on a   floor dubbed ”B6.” ’ ’   There two   employees were preparing a presentation for   the CEO, Eddie Lampert, when their boss rushed in with some     advice. ’ ’   On a chart pad he wrote three words. ’ ’   ”He looks at the presenters and says, ’’Do not say these words to   that guy,’’” according to a former Sears executive who described   the meeting to Business Insider. ”That guy” meant Lampert,   who would soon appear on a giant projector screen at the   front of the room, beamed in live from a home office inside a $38   million Florida estate  —   1, 400 miles away from headquarters. ’ ’   The pad with the three words was out of sight of Lampert’’s video   feed. One of the words on it was ”consumer.” ’ ’   The stakes were high. If any of those words were uttered in front   of Lampert, the two presenters would ”get shredded” by the CEO,   whose frequent tirades had fostered a climate of fear among the   company’’s most senior managers, another person  —   this one a   former vice president  —   explained. ’ ’   These two and other executives say the word ”consumer” can   trigger Lampert. He ’ ’   It was at that moment, as the executive attending the   meeting watched fellow employees anxiously censor themselves   in front of Lampert, that he realized he needed to flee the   sinking    company. ’ ’  ’ ’   Lampert, a former Wall Street prodigy, took control of Sears more   than a decade ago and became its CEO in 2013. But he’’s rarely   seen in the office, typically visiting about once a year for the   shareholder meeting and projecting into videoconference rooms at   Sears’’ Hoffman Estates, Illinois headquarters the rest of the   time, according to interviews with employees. He prefers to stay   on Indian Creek Island off the coast of Miami, behind a   desk dressed up with the Sears logo. The island has   been dubbed the ”billionaire bunker,” partly because of   a private police force that protects the island’’s 86   residents. ’ ’   ”The only way you see Eddie is through a screen,” one former   executive told Business Insider. ”We used to joke about who had   to go upstairs to get fixed and see Oz.” ’ ”   Lampert’s physical absence might be better received if Sears,   which also owns Kmart, was in better shape. But the retailer,   famous for selling everything from shoes to vacuum cleaners to   whole houses, is facing its biggest crisis ever. It’s closing   hundreds of stores. Others are in shambles, with leaking ceilings   and broken escalators. In some, employees  to shield shoppers from sections that stand   empty. ” ’   Lampert, a billionaire, is trying to keep Sears afloat. He   recently provided up to $1 billion in financing to help keep   it in operation.  ’ ’  ’ ’   Business Insider spoke with more than a dozen employees, ranging   from store clerks to senior executives, about the unraveling   of Sears. Many spoke on the condition that they not be identified   for fear of legal retribution from Lampert and Sears, including   one person who specified that she would only speak off the record   upon the advice of an attorney. Some said they had signed   nondisclosure forms barring them from sharing information about   the company.  ’ ’  ’ ”   The employees who spoke to Business Insider describe an internal   mess with a revolving door of executives and low   morale. Senior executives say Lampert has cut investments in   stores because he’s trying to turn it into a tech company that   collects and sells customer data through the Shop Your Way   loyalty program. ” ’   In the past, Lampert has defended his strategy, saying he intends   to turn Sears into a more ” ” organization, but one   that would still include physical stores. He denies widespread   claims that he’’s stripping the company of all its most valuable   properties and brands and hastening its bankruptcy. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Failure is a near certainty, according to industry watchers.   Analysts are expecting Sears to file for bankruptcy within the   next two years, and perhaps much sooner. ’ ’   Former and current Sears staff members who spoke to Business   Insider put the blame squarely on Lampert for destroying the   iconic American brand. ’ ’   Lampert, 54, has the pedigree of a Wall Street blue blood. He   graduated from Yale, worked at Goldman Sachs, and started his own   hedge fund, ESL Investments, when he was 26. He was a celebrated   investor for much of his   career. ’ ’   ESL generated annualized returns of more than 20% a year for 20   years, marking one of the strongest   investment records   in history, according to a . In 2004,  asked if   Lampert was the next Warren Buffett. ’ ’  ’ ”   But Lampert’s career, before Sears’ downfall, was not without   drama. Most notably, on a January evening in 2003, as Lampert was   walking to his car from his office in Greenwich, Connecticut,   four people grabbed him, shoved him into a rented SUV, and took   him to a cheap motel, where he was held captive for 28 hours,   . The ever private Lampert has never spoken about   the incident publicly. ” ”   At the time of the kidnapping, Lampert was hammering out the   final details of a deal to acquire the discount retailer Kmart   out of bankruptcy. Then in 2005, he combined it with Sears to   create Sears Holdings in what was, at the time, the largest   retail merger ever. ESL, which has long been one of Sears’   largest shareholders, now owns about half of the company with   Lampert. ” ’   About a year after the deal to create Sears Holdings closed,   Lampert described the company  —   which included more than 3, 000   Sears and Kmart stores  —   as a ”$55       startup.” ’ ’   ”My goal is to see Sears Holdings become a great company whose   greatness is sustainable for generations to come,” Lampert, then   just chairman of the company, told shareholders in a . ’ ”   He has  to Apple’s and Microsoft’s,   and in his most recent letter to shareholders, he said that Sears   is trying to meet new customer needs like Uber, Amazon, and Tesla   are doing. Sears is facing more scrutiny from Wall Street than   those companies, however, because of the sheer fact that it’s a   retail company, he said. ” ’   ”In an environment where new companies like Uber can raise almost   unlimited capital, what are the implications for older companies   that are held to a very different standard when it comes to   profitability and regulation?” . ’ ”   A hard look at the numbers shows that Sears Holdings looks   nothing like a   tech company. In the near term, Sears   must raise about $1. 5 billion to stay in business through 2017,   according to Moody’s. ” ’  ’ ’   How Sears would raise that money ”remains unclear,” according to   Kirk Ludtke, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ”But we suspect that   it involves the closure of a significant number of unprofitable   stores,” he recently wrote. ’ ”   The company is doing just that. It announced in the last   week that it’s closing 150 Sears and Kmart stores, or roughly 10%   of its store base, in early 2017. Sears has arranged a deal to   sell its iconic Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker for   about $900 million, which includes a cash payment of $525 in the   near term and another $250 million in three years, as well as   ongoing payments as a percentage of Craftsman sales. ” ’   The company is also looking for buyers for its Kenmore and   DieHard brands. ’ ’   And Lampert has been lending the company money to pay off debt   and keep it afloat. Within the last two weeks, ESL has promised   Sears up to $1 billion in loans and letters of credit, in   addition to a $300 million cash infusion in the second   quarter. ESL has suffered too. Its assets are down to $2. 8   billion from $18 billion in 2007, according to a March 2016   regulatory filing. ’ ”   Traditional   retailers have been hit hard by the rise of   online shopping and falling foot traffic in shopping malls. But   current and former workers say Sears’ problems have more to do   with Lampert’s management and strategies than the larger industry   changes. ” ’   The videoconference room on B6 where employees meet  —     virtually  —   with Lampert, has become infamous for the shouting   matches that happen inside its walls. ’ ’   The first time a new Sears vice president strolled into the room   two years ago, he found top managers sitting around a table,   burying their faces in computers. He tried to introduce himself  —     ”Hey!” ”Hi!” and ”How are you doing?”  —   but he didn’’t get much in   return. ’ ’   ”I see everyone look up like, ’’Do you know where you are? ’’ And I   was like, ’’What the hell is going on? ’’” he told Business Insider.   He later understood why. ’ ’  ’ ’   Lampert has been known to get so angry in these meetings,   particularly when he is challenged, that employees gossip about   who is getting ushered into the conference room on any given day   to ”get their knees cut off,” one former manager told Business   Insider. ’ ”   The meetings typically start with a presentation, and then   Lampert fires off a series of questions to the presenter until he   finds one that the person can’t answer, one former vice president   said. ” ’   ”He would find a hole in the data and then explode,” the   executive said. ”Then there would be a   rant.” ’ ’   Lampert’’s management style  —   including the harrowing   videoconferences  —   has been questioned before. In a  that focused on the   fierce competition between business units, the CEO defended his   approach as a way to ”drive   and accountability at   a more appropriate level.” ’ ”   But the situation has taken on a far greater urgency in the three   years since that story was published. Sales are down 37% since   early 2013, Sears’ debt load has spiked to over $1. 6 billion, and   the company is losing well over $1 billion annually. To meet its   obligations, the company has been selling off valuable brands and   properties. ” ’   Before Sears and Kmart, Lampert had no experience in retail. The   big plan he hoped would transform Sears was a rewards program   called Shop Your Way, which the company introduced in 2009. ’ ”   Through the program, frequent buyers accumulate points for their   Sears and Kmart purchases and turn them into coupons and   discounts. One primary goal of Shop Your Way was to acquire   customers’ personal information and sell it to other companies,   according to a former executive who worked on the program. ” ”   There’s also a social networking component on shopyourway. com,   where members can see and comment on products their friends have   liked or purchased. ” ’   One user, who goes by the name Eli Wexler, posts frequently on   the site, asking questions such as if a $2, 495 handbag is ”too   expensive, or is it worth it?” ’ ’   In 2013, Bloomberg reported that Eli Wexler is a   pseudonym for Lampert himself. ’ ’   In February 2016, Lampert, presumably posting as Wexler, clicked   on a pair of boxing gloves and posed a question: ”Does anybody   have these? Will it protect my hands since I punch very hard?” ’ ’  ’ ’   Lampert aggressively pushed the rewards program, requiring store   employees to meet ambitious quotas for new  . But in many   ways it backfired. The program is complicated, and it has    angering customers. ’ ’   Because of the program, Kmart cashiers went from scanning 18   items a minute to just five, according to a former assistant   manager at one store who left in 2012 after 12 years with the   company. Some frustrated customers abandon their shopping carts,   forcing employees to return all the goods back to shelves. ’ ’   At the same time Lampert was pushing Shop Your Way and posting on   the site, employees started complaining that Sears had stopped   investing in its physical stores. ’ ’   ”While we have been criticized for not investing more in our   stores, I have explained in the past that the investments in our   transformation go well beyond our stores, but don’’t ignore our   stores,” Lampert wrote in a letter to shareholders in February   2016. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”We believe that our investments in the Shop Your Way membership   platform and our integrated retail capabilities were more   appropriate investments given the massive shift in how customers   are shopping and how competition has evolved.” ’ ’   ”Integrated retail capabilities” is Lampert’’s term for shopping   at stores and online. ’ ’   Sears stopped reporting its   growth in 2014, and Shop   Your Way is now a ”giant margin drain,” according to two former   executives who worked closely with the program. Part of the   problem is simply that Sears’’ clientele is generally older and   less interested in online shopping. ’ ’   ”The reality is, when your top line falls as significantly as it   has and your customer base doesn’’t buy all online  —   they are     to older, and they shop the store  —   as much as you   try to shift channels to online, it’’s just not happening,” one   former executive said. ’ ’   Lampert has conceded that the company has ”fallen short” on   getting customers engaged in the program. ’ ’   ”Our reputation will change when we get [the Shop Your Way   network] to matter,” he said at the company’’s annual meeting in   2016, according to . ’ ”   Lampert’s plan is for Sears to one day be a tech company, more   like Apple or Facebook than a traditional retailer, according to   three former executives. ” ’   ”He’s got it all set out in his mind, how he wants things to run,   regardless of any type of value proposition,” said one former   employee. ”If Eddie thinks it’’s ’’cool’’ and it will position us   with Amazon or what the young people are buying, then you go   marching toward it like a zombie.” ’ ’   Interviews with dozens of   and corporate employees   over the past year yielded a common refrain: Lampert is out of   touch with reality.  ’ ’   ”He refuses to put a dime in updating stores,” one former vice   president said. ”You walk in and you are embarrassed as an   employee when the ceilings are leaking and the floors are   cracked.” ’ ’   ”No one believes in Eddie’’s vision,” this person said. ”He has   just gone rogue.” ’ ”   Business Insider spoke to several   employees who said   the stores are severely understaffed, with some operating on   fewer than half of the employees they need. That has led to   widespread complaints among shoppers that they can’t find an   employee to check them out, so they end up leaving the store    . ” ’   Lampert continues to assert that the retailer is in the midst of   a ”transformation” into a more ” ” organization  —     rather than the ”protracted liquidation” that critics describe it   as. ’ ’  ’ ”   He’s telling that to investors, analysts, and store employees in   blog posts, annual letters, and at shareholder meetings, as well   as to members of his senior team of executives, according to   interviews with Sears employees. ” ’   For all the problems in Sears stores, Lampert has set up his   various businesses in a way that means he has other ways   to gain no matter what happens to the company. ’ ’   To be sure, ESL holds a majority share of Sears, and   that stake has lost   of its value just in the   past few years  —   more than $1. 5 billion since early 2015 alone. ’ ’   But Lampert, through ESL, has loaned Sears more than $1. 12   billion and promised an additional $679 million over the   past two years to help keep the company afloat. In return, Sears   pays origination fees and interest directly to ESL, and, by   extension, Lampert. A recent shareholder complaint claims that   Lampert and ESL made at least $19 million in fees and interest   payments from a $400 million loan in 2014. ’ ”   Lampert and ESL could potentially seize stores and inventory if   Sears can’t pay its bills. That $400 million loan, for   instance, is backed by collateral of 25 stores valued at $500   million total. ” ”   Even if the company went bankrupt, Lampert wouldn’t walk away     according to bankruptcy experts and former   executives. ” ’   ”He’’s moving money from one pocket to the other pocket, and he’’s   protected himself on both sides,” one former vice   president said. ”The guy is a brilliant asset manager. He’’s   just not a retailer.” ’ ’  ’ ”   Shareholders have filed suit against ESL for another way they say   Lampert benefits from both sides of Sears’ dealings. ” ’   It starts with a   investment trust called Seritage   Growth Properties, which Lampert created in 2015. Even though   they are separate entities, Lampert and his hedge fund own a   little more than 43% of Seritage. They also own a little more   than 54% of Sears Holdings. ’ ’   After creating Seritage, Lampert orchestrated a big     deal. Sears sold 235 stores to Seritage in 2015. Sears raised   $2. 7 billion from the sale and rented back the store space from   Seritage. ’ ’   In many of these locations, Seritage has the right to take over   all or half of the square footage from the Sears stores and then   rent the empty space to other retailers at sometimes four   times the rent. ’ ’   ”Seritage is transforming retail rents from $4 per square foot to   $” Sears director Bruce Berkowitz said in November on a   conference call for his investment fund, which also owns a stake   in the REIT. ”Seritage clearly proves the point about the value   of the real estate remaining at Sears.” ’ ’   It has already happened in six stores and seven Sears auto   centers, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.   Seritage has converted half the square footage in nine other   stores. ’ ’  ’ ”   Sears also has the option to exit all the leases and give the   space to Seritage. This is good for Sears when it needs to close   stores, and it’s good for Seritage, which can then rent it out to   other companies. Sears has already begun to do this, terminating   leases on 17 stores it plans to vacate this month. ” ’   But in their lawsuit, shareholders accuse Lampert of stripping   Sears Holdings of its core assets to benefit himself and his   hedge fund. They say the Seritage deal unfairly enriches Lampert   at the expense of other Sears investors, as the stores were sold   well below market rates. ’ ’   ”Eddie Lampert used his position at Sears as its CEO and   controlling shareholder to further his and his hedge fund’’s   interests rather than the best interests of the company [by   spinning off its]   assets to the REIT at an unfair   price,” said Ned Weinberger, a partner at the law firm Labaton   Sucharow LLP, which is representing the shareholders. ’ ’   The meeting in which employees were instructed not to say the   word ”consumer” was the last straw for one senior executive who   spoke to Business Insider. ’ ’   It was emblematic of an overarching problem plaguing Sears:   Lampert ”doesn’’t want to hear anything that challenges his   vision,” even if it could help improve business, he said. ’ ’   The executive sought guidance from a colleague after the meeting,   who advised him to jump ship. ’ ’   ”He said, ’’On your watch, this thing is going to sink,’’” the   executive said. ”This is when I knew I had to leave.” ’ ’  ’ ”   There has been an unusual number of   departures   from Sears in the last several years. At least 67 executives  —       level or higher  —   have left the company just   within the last two years, according to LinkedIn data. Fifteen of   them left after less than two years of service, and seven left   after less than 12 months, according to the employees’ profiles. ” ”   The departures include Sears’ chief financial officer, Robert   Schriesheim; its executive vice president, Jeff Balagna; and its   president and chief member officer, Joelle Maher. None of the   three responded to Business Insider’s requests for comment on   their departures. ” ’  ’ ’   ”There are so many people running for the door not just because   the ship is sinking, but because the captain of the ship is   screaming at them, blaming it on them, and telling them it’’s   their fault,” one former vice president said. ’ ’   Evercore ISI analyst Greg Melich, the last remaining stock   research analyst covering Sears, noted last year that Sears   executives ”tend to last less than a year or two.” ’ ’   One   employee who currently works in the corporate   office said people are quitting, updating their LinkedIn profiles   and résumés, and ”having whispered conversations” in their   cubicles about the state of the company. ’ ”   But no one really knows what’s going to happen. ” ’   ”As of right now, it is all up in the air,” this person wrote. ’ ”   Sears’ suppliers, meanwhile, are getting nervous and canceling   orders, according to current and former corporate employees, as   well as representatives of the manufacturers. ” ”   An employee who worked out of Sears’ former New York City design   office, which the company shut down in July, said vendors have   started canceling orders because they can’t get insurance on   their shipments. ” ’   ”It started happening about a year ago, and then it started   happening more and more,” this person said. ’ ’  ’ ’   A   manager at headquarters also told Business Insider   that suppliers have been canceling contracts. ’ ’   ”It’’s getting really hard to do my job,” this employee, who works   directly with Sears vendors, wrote in an email. ”A lot of vendors   are discreetly cutting ties with Sears.” ’ ’   The employee declined to provide names for the companies involved   out of fear of retribution if they were discovered as the source   of the information. ’ ”   All of this, industry watchers say, means chances for Sears’   survival have dwindled. ” ’   ”They are going out of business,” said Van Conway, an expert in   bankruptcy and debt restructuring and CEO of Van Conway &   Partners. ”This snowball is 90% of the way to the bottom of the   hill.” ’ ”   That’s one reason those executives look so nervous in   that videoconference room at headquarters, while   Lampert, sitting at home in Florida, keeps finding ways to plug   holes with cash infusions. ” ”   One day, Sears’ assets will likely run dry. And right now,   there’s no sign of a strategy that would cure the underlying   business by restoring brand loyalty and sales, Conway said. ” ’   ”The game’’s over,” he said. ’
