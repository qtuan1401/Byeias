Per a Fox 8 report, a    South Carolina boy is facing assault charges after school bus video shows him using another student’s hand to slap a    girl last week.  According to police, Tavon Walters was riding the bus from school to an   program when the incident occurred. He can be seen in the video grabbing a student’s hand and using it to hit Jazmyn Peters in the face. “He had reached over that seat and telling another girl if you don’t hit her then I’m going to hit her for you,” Jazmyn’s father Terry Peters said. Walters, who is reportedly on probation for his previous history of violence, turned himself in on Tuesday and was given a $1, 000 bond. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
