The Times of Israel reports: A small team of researchers based in the hills outside Jerusalem is designing technology that could potentially save thousands of women’s lives per year. [The company behind this, Illumigyn, is using advanced imaging technology originating in the Israeli military to develop medical hardware that gynecologists could use to better identify and treat cervical cancer and other diseases in routine inspections for women.  “The product is ready, and this is a   experience for the patient, for the quality of service, and for the ability to treat women, not only at the point of injury, or problem, but also through their entire life,” said Ran Poliakine, the serial entrepreneur funding the project.
