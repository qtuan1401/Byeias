Why is the Obama administration hiding the truth about the terrorist    phone calls? [The White House feigned ignorance that President Barack Obama had anything to do with the redaction of the transcripts.  “The decision about the release of the transcripts is one that was made solely by Department of Justice and FBI officials,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said to reporters during the daily press briefing. He insisted that Obama had no role in the decision to redact the text of the text to distract from the motives of the attacks. The text of the transcripts used the text [omitted] in the place of the shooter’s references to the Islamic faith, being an Islamic soldier and replaced the word “Allah” with the word “God. ” Earnest said that the Justice Department and the F. B. I had decided to redact the transcript “consistent with their assessment about the best way to advance the investigation. ” He said that he hadn’t seen House Speaker Paul Ryan’s call for the administration to release the full underrated text so that Americans could have a   understanding of the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorists. Congressional Republicans joined the speaker by criticizing the Obama administration’s decision to redact the text of the phone calls. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul issued a redacted statement mocking the redactions by the administration.  —   @RepMcCaul has some fun with redactions in his reaction statement  &gt pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) June 20, 2016,
