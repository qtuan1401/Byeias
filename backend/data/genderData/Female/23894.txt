GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee commented on the release of four Americans from Iran. “Praise God that Christian pastor Saeed Abedini has been freed from his   prison sentence for serving the Lord, spreading the Gospel and planting house churches across Iran! ”[Huckabee added, “I join millions of Americans and his overjoyed wife Naghmeh in saying, ‘Well done Saeed! You are a faithful servant! And welcome home! ’”  But why did it take the Obama Administration so long to secure his release? He never should have been jailed and it’s embarrassing that John Kerry and Obama negotiate with Iran as innocent Americans remained   in prison. President Obama is a complete fool for trusting a country that’s been lying, cheating, murdering and sponsoring terrorism around the globe for 37 years. Empowering Iran with sanctions relief is like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to Adolf Hitler before WWII hoping he’ll behave. This Iran deal is an insane disaster and this White House has lost its mind. According to the Associated Press, the four Americans were exchanged for seven Iranians currently being detained or charged in the United States. “U. S. officials say the four Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, former Marine Amir Hekmati and pastor Saeed Abidini, were to be flown from Iran to Switzerland on a Swiss plane and then brought to a U. S. military base in Landstuhl, Germany, for medical treatment,” reports the Associated Press.
