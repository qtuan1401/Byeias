Monday while campaigning in Kentucky before the Tuesday primary, Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton faced off with a heckler who did not agree with Clinton’s criticism of the state’s Republican governor, Matt Bevin.  After a woman interpreted her Clinton said, “You are entitled to your opinion, but you’re not entitled to your own facts! And I’ll be happy when I finish talking to everybody else for you to come over here and you can tell me what you are saying, and we can talk and we can hear whats on your mind. But I’ll tell you what the truth is. And you know it’s time people stopped listening to Republican propaganda!”
