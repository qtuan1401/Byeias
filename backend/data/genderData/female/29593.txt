Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said his opponent party   Hillary Clinton has the experience but clearly lacks the judgment to be president of the United States.  Sanders said, “If you look at where she is getting her money, from Wall Street and other powerful special interests, she voted for the war, she cited Henry Kissinger in a sense as a model for her. I think those issues will tell the American people that in many respects she may have the experience to be president of the United States. No one can argue that. But in terms of her judgment, something is clearly lacking. ” He added, “When you vote for virtually every trade agreement that that cost workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water, and essentially when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
