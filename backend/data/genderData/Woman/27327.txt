This story originally appeared at the Washington Times:  The State Department paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayers grants to an Israeli group that used the money to build a campaign to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in last year’s Israeli parliamentary elections, a congressional investigation concluded Tuesday. Some $350, 000 was sent to OneVoice, ostensibly to support the group’s efforts to back   peace settlement negotiations.
