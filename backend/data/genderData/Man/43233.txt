’  ’ ’   The Obama administration is ending a policy that   allowed Cubans who arrived in the US without visas to stay   and gain residency, the Associated Press  on Thursday, citing a senior   administration official. ’ ’   The change in the policy, known as ”wet foot, dry foot,” is   effective immediately, the official told the AP. ’ ’   The US and Cuba have spent several months negotiating the change,   including an agreement from Cuba to allow those turned away from   the US to return, the official said,  to the AP. ’ ’   The Cubans gave no assurances about treatment for those sent back   to the country, the official  the AP, but political asylum will still   be an option for those worried about mistreatment if sent back. ’ ’   President Bill Clinton  it in 1995,   changing a more liberal immigration policy. The Cuban   government complained about the policy, saying it  and encouraged migrants to make dangerous trips   (though it also let the most unhappy Cubans exit the     state). ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”The Obama Administration has taken a positive step toward a more   sensible Cuban immigration policy, one that ends preferential   treatment for Cubans compared with others who arrive without   visas,” Washington Office on Latin America program director Geoff   Thale said in a statement after the announcement. ’ ’   ”This change ’’normalizes’’ our treatment of Cuban   immigrants,” Thale added in the statement. ’ ’   (Writing for Reuters by Eric Beech; editing by Eric Walsh) ’
