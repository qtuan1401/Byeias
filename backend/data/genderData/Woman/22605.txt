Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page said the newest details in the investigation into Hillary Clinton private email server shows that “it wasn’t a matter of convenience, which is what she told the world,” and that it raises questions about “honesty. ”  Host John Dickerson said, “There was news on the email front with Hillary Clinton  —   didn’t turn over an email that showed there were problems with her server. That’s not good. ” Page answered, “An important disclosure for two reasons . Number one she gave a different explanation for why she had a private email server, she was concerned about the personal being accessible, it wasn’t a matter of convenience, which is what she told the world. Secondly, she didn’t turn it over. She deleted this email apparently and it came up because it came to the aid that she had sent it to. So it goes right to those questions about honesty, trustworthiness, transparency. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
