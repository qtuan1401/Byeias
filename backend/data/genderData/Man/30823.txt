White House reporters following President Obama’s California fundraising tour were forced to wait in a garage, as President Obama attended an event hosted by Spiderman star Tobey Maguire, whose star role has since been replaced by two other younger actors. [“Greetings from Tobey Maguire’s garage,” wrote Bloomberg’s Angela Greiling Keane on Twitter. “It’s sort of like an ordinary garage but neat and with a Tesla charger. ”  “One of the most unusual White House pool holds I’ve been in: an LA garage decorated w greenery  flowers,” wrote the Washington Post’s Juliet Eilperin on Twitter, sharing a picture of the garage.

Most presidential fundraisers allow the press in for remarks by the president before ushering them out into a separate room during the rest of the event. In recent years, Obama has attended more exclusive, speedier events with donors during the day described as “roundtables. ” Those events are usually closed to the press. Tickets for the event were listed at $33, 400. Later this afternoon, he will attend a second event for the Democratic National Committee, before his third fundraiser of the day this evening. Obama also attended a fundraiser last night in Los Angeles.
