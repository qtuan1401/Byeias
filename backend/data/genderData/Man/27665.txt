Watching the Golden State Warriors smack down the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday night, former NBA champion Metta World Peace, a. k. a. Ron Artest, decided to promote racial harmony through comedy while offering some guidelines to prevent future hurt feelings. [In his own words:  I love Racist jokes. So funny. I wish the world wasn’t so sensitive  …    I love when white people make black low blow jokes and vice versa.  —   Metta World Peace (@MettaWorldPeace) November 4, 2016,  We need this sensitivity to stop so we can get back to comedy.  —   Metta World Peace (@MettaWorldPeace) November 4, 2016,  If I were president I would allow Everyone in the world 2 rascist jokes per ethnicity per year. No losing jobs . Btw, okc getting beat bad,  —   Metta World Peace (@MettaWorldPeace) November 4, 2016,  This really wise man said we are not the same. And that is what makes us so special as people. We are so different, and that’s so cool,  —   Metta World Peace (@MettaWorldPeace) November 4, 2016,  Be different. Feel good about who you are. Love other people. And make tons of jokes. We need more comedy. If you agree, retweet me,  —   Metta World Peace (@MettaWorldPeace) November 4, 2016,  I think the only jokes that are bad are like Slave jokes and holocaust jokes. Some people be serious and not joking. But we need more laughs,  —   Metta World Peace (@MettaWorldPeace) November 4, 2016,  Metta might really have something here. Can coincidence account for the fact that race relations have worsened as   and political correctness have grown? Now, even liberal and relatively   comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld won’t perform at colleges because of how politically correct they’ve become. No, it is definitely no accident.
