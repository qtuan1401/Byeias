’  ’ ’   Remember what happened a year ago? ’ ’   China shocked financial markets with a sudden devaluation of the   renminbi, cutting it by 3% against the dollar over the course of   five trading days. ’ ’   That helped drive  with global stock indexes dropping   by 10% in the aftermath. ’ ’   The devaluation was widely seen as a sign that the Chinese   economy was in a much worse state than anyone had previously   believed. ’ ’   ”It was not the currency move per se that concerned market   participants, but rather its implications for the Chinese   economy, trade flows, and global growth rates,”   The  ’ ’Here is Thomas: ’ ’   It appears that these efforts are paying off. ’ ’   First, factory price deflation in China has fallen   sharply: ’ ’  ’ ’   ”A year ago, producers’’ finished goods prices were falling at a   6% annual rate,” Thomas said. ”Prices have declined by just 1. 7%   over the past 12 months and now appear to be rising on a   sequential (  ) basis.” ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Real debt service burdens in the Chinese industrial sector have   already declined by more than 4 percentage points,” said Thomas. ’ ’  ’ ’   Finally, the  has helped reduce empty residences by   45% according to the report. The sector grew at a faster pace   than the overall economy in the second quarter of 2016: ’ ’  ’ ”   That’s not to say that all’s well in China, however. It continues   to suffer from excess capacity, nonperforming loans, and   declining returns on capital, according to Thomas. ” ’   ”Monetary policy cannot solve these structural problems, nor was   that the intention,” Thomas said. ”Instead, Chinese   policymakers deserve credit for acting decisively to     a potential deflationary spiral. As is often the   case, the simplest explanation turned out to be the best.” ’
