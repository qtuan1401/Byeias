’  ’ ’   Star chef, author, and television personality Anthony Bourdain   rarely stays in one place for too long. “I travel   days a   year for work,” he said . ’ ’   But if he had to live out the rest of his days in a hotel, he   wouldn’t go to  or      Marseilles. Instead, he’d retreat to . ’ ’   “I would not feel cheated by life if I died in Chateau Marmont  …    ”   Bourdain said. “I love that hotel above all others. ” ’ ’  ’ ’   It’s one of the most iconic hotels in Hollywood  —   a veritable    since the   1930s  —   and is easily recognized by its Loire Valley castle   inspiration. Amongst the lemon trees, climbing vines, and   bougainvillea are charming bungalows that provide privacy and   paradise to even the most boldfaced names. ’ ’   “I feel like I’m staying with family every time I go,” Bourdain   added. “It’s the sort of place where, if you forget to put your   pants on and walk down to the lobby in your pajamas, nobody’s   going to care.” ’ ’   Surprisingly, Bourdain suggested that the Chateau Marmont was a   friendlier version of  in that it’’s ”an organic   entity” with a ”heart and soul.” ’ ’   Head to Bar Marmont for late night drinks (no earlier than   midnight) around a candlelit, marble table, and you may even   catch a glimpse of Bourdain among the   crowds.  ’
