.@mikebarnicle: What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo? @GovGaryJohnson: And what is Aleppo?  https:  .  Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson was caught dumbfounded when he was asked what he would do about Aleppo, the Syrian city at the heart of nation’s civil war.  “What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?” MSNBC’s Mike Barnicle asked Johnson. “And what is Aleppo?” Johnson replied. Once Johnson determined what Aleppo was, he offered his thoughts on Syria. “OK, got it,” he said. “Well, with regard to Syria, I do think that it is a mess. I think the only way that we deal with Syria is to join hands with Russia to diplomatically bring that at an end but when we align ourselves with  —   when we’ve supported the opposition, the Free Syrian Army, the Free Syrian Army coupled with the Islamists and the the fact that we’re also supporting the Kurds and that is, it’s just a mess. And that this is the result of regime change that we end up supporting and inevitably these regime changes have led to a less safe world. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
