President Barack Obama says that it’s up to Americans to make changes to the internet to protect women from social media harassment. [“We need to change an internet where women are routinely harassed and threatened when they go online,” he said during the White House United State Of Women conference in Washington D. C. organized by his senior adviser Valerie Jarrett today.  Obama took the podium, declaring that he is a feminist. “I may be a little grayer than I was eight years ago, but this is what a feminist looks like,” he said proudly, as the the audience cheered wildly. “Of course in my house there is no choice,” he added, referring to living with only his wife, daughters, and    in the White House. Obama praised his former presidential opponent Hillary Clinton for raising expectations for American girls by winning enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination. “For the first time in history, a woman is a major party’s presumptive presidential nominee,” he said. He recalled that his oldest daughter Malia graduated High School last weekend. “I only cried once,” he said, describing the “weird sound” he made during the ceremony.  He celebrated the changes that had occurred for women in the internet, pointing out that when he was born, birth control was illegal in some states. “Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, birth control is now free,” he boasted. He praised his daughters for their progressive views on issues that were once contentious, calling for a future that was no longer “segregated into pink and blue. ” “They think discrimination is for losers. They think it’s weird that we haven’t already had a woman president,” he said. “They expect the world to catch up to them. ”
