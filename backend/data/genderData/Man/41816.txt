 (CNN) Rocker Jon Bon Jovi gave Rutgers University grads another reason to smile at their graduation.  The New   singer, known for hits like ”Livin’ on a Prayer,” used his commencement speech to unveil a new song.  ”I tried to buy you all a gift” he said to the students at the university’s Camden campus, ”but I wasn’t sure of sizes or favorite colors.” So instead, the rocker did what he does best: picked up a guitar and performed a new song he wrote for the occasion.  ”Reunion” advises students to ”learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky” and also to ”start your revolution.”  Fitting because Bon Jovi was invited to speak and honored for his charitable work.  He founded The Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation which works on issues of hunger, homelessness and poverty.  For this work, the school awarded the singer an honorary doctorate in letters.
