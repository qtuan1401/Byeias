CLEVELAND, Ohio  —   Another melée broke out on radio row at the Republican National Convention on Thursday afternoon, and ended with comedian Jimmy Dore spitting a beverage into the face of controversial Internet talk show host Alex Jones. [The video, captured by The New American Media, shows a scuffle on the set of liberal Cenk Uygur’s YouTube show, The Young Turks. Jones “crashed” the set with his microphone, and a furious Uygur shouted, “You’re the biggest liar in the media!” Staffers shouted, “Get the fuck off the stage!” “You just want attention!” Eventually, Uygur had to be restrained from hitting Jones.  Meanwhile, Dore sneaked behind the scrum, bottle in hand, and spat in Jones’s face. Watch the video at 1:02 below: The cameraman from The New American Media caught him in the act, but Dore had little to say  —   in the moment, or on Twitter. He did, however, retweet a fan who praised him for being a “firefighter”: Can’t see it too well but @jimmy_dore became a firefighter today #FTW in giving AJ a cold shower. #tytlive pic. twitter.   —   TM (@TMnFL) July 21, 2016,  There has been an epidemic of   at the Republican National Convention. Jones himself was crashed on Monday by comedian Eric André, who then crashed Breitbart News’ live stream, though without comedic success. After Twitter permanently banned Breitbart News tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos, Breitbart reporters walked to the Twitter lounge  —   awkwardly situated immediately across from the Breitbart set  —   and conducted crash interviews, asking if Twitter employees and executives believed in free speech. It is not clear what Uyghur did to deserve being crashed he is a vehemently   host, but courteous. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
