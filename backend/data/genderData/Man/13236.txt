Tuesday, Fox Sports 1 “Undisputed”   Shannon Sharpe reacted to Tim Tebow showing up to spring training for the New York Mets organization and showing out in batting practice.  Sharpe questioned the authenticity of Tebow getting a shot at baseball, adding the former NFL quarterback “doesn’t have a chance” of making the Mets’ roster. “I’m just trying to figure out, Skip. Look, I don’t knock anybody for trying, but I’m looking at it, why? He doesn’t have a chance of the making the team, Skip. You know that. You saw him in the fall league when he was playing against guys, and a lot of those guys are not going to get called up, not going to be on a   roster. And he couldn’t hit them. What makes you think that he can hit constant   pitches?   can’t constantly hit   pitches,” Sharpe stated. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
