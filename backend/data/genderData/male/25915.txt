A viral National Rifle Association (NRA) television commercial features country music star Charlie Daniels warning terrorists that Americans are fighters who  —   together with the NRA  —   stand as “freedom’s safest place. ”[During the   commercial, Daniels intimates that the American spirit is not   in President Obama and that Obama and “his   Ivy League friends” may give   attackers the wrong idea their weakness may actually give terrorists a false sense of security.  The commercial debuted at NRA meetings this weekend, where it drew a sizable reaction from the audience.  So Daniels warns that terrorists who do not fear Obama ought to fear the American citizen and particularly American citizens aligned under the banner of the NRA. Daniels says: To the ayatollahs of Iran and every terrorist you enable, listen up. You might have met our   flower child president and his   Ivy League friends, but you haven’t met America. You haven’t met the heartland, where the people will defend this nation with their bloody, calloused, bare hands, if that’s what it takes. You haven’t met the steel workers and the hard rock miners or the swamp folks in Cajun country —  who can wrestle a   gator out of the water. You haven’t met the farmers, the cowboys, the loggers, and the truck drivers. You don’t know the mountain men who live off the land or the brave cops who fight the good fight in the urban war zones. No, you’ve never met America. And you ought to pray you never do. I’m the National Rifle Association of America, and I’m freedom’s safest place.
