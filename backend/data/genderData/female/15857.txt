Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein confirmed that he supports Hillary Clinton for president, despite his reluctance to endorse a candidate throughout the campaign. [“I’m supportive of Hillary Clinton,” Blankfein said, according to a CNN transcript published by Bloomberg. “Yes, so flat out, yes, I do. ”  Blankfein was careful to say he didn’t agree with all of Clinton’s polices or with her political record. Clinton was paid $675, 000 for three separate speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2013  —   a fact that her primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders said proved that she was too cozy with Wall Street. Sanders repeatedly called for her to release the transcripts of the speeches with Goldman Sachs, but the campaign refused. In October, however, the contents of the speeches were published by Wikileaks.
