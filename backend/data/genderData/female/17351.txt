Tim Tebow’s attempt to make a Major League Baseball roster will apparently continue on for several more months at least. [Speaking to reporters at baseball’s winter meetings on Tuesday, Met’s manager Terry Collins heaped praise on Tebow and said he expects to see him in the Mets major league camp. Collins told reporters on Tuesday, “I certainly hope we’ll see Tim Tebow in some of our games. If he’s not in our camp, I’ll get him over. ”  Speaking about Tebow personally, Collins said, “He’s not into himself. He’s into being a teammate. A tremendous teammate. He’s won wherever he’s been. ” Tebow played 19 games for the Mets affiliate in the Arizona Fall League. The former Heisman winner had a rough go of it there. In 62 plate appearances, Tebow amassed only 12 hits, three doubles, while posting a . 194 batting average. Still, Collins has a point, Tebow has “won wherever he’s been. ” Except with the Jets of course. Some things are above even Tebow’s   working power. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
