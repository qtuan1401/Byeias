Melissa Click, the professor who was fired after she called for the physical removal of a student journalist during an incident at the University of Missouri, has found work at Gonzaga University. [In a video that went viral in February, Click is shown calling for “some muscle”  to remove a student journalist who was legally filming a campus protest that erupted over racial incidents that occurred at the University of Missouri.  Administrators at Gonzaga University released a statement claiming that Click was hired after an extensive national search. “Dr. Click was hired through an extensive national search process that revealed her to be the most qualified and experienced candidate for the position,” the statement reads. “Dr. Click has excellent recommendations for both her teaching and scholarship, which includes an extensive record of publication,” it continues. “We are confident she has learned much from her experiences at the University of Missouri and believe she will uphold the rigorous standards of academic excellence demanded of Gonzaga faculty and students. ” Elisabeth   the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Gonzaga, released a written statement claiming that the university is aware of Click’s past conduct. Click was fired from the University of Missouri following the incident. She appealed the decision in March but was denied. Following her dismissal, a video of her hurling profanities at a police officer emerged online. Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
