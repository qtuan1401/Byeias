Breitbart News National Security Editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka, author of the bestselling book Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, invited Breitbart News Daily listeners on Tuesday to compare photos of Presidents George Bush or Barack Obama at the beginning and end of their terms to get an idea of how much the Oval Office ages its occupants. [He said:  You will see every president, in recent years, literally ages about 25 years. They go gray in just a matter of their first term, usually. This is a product of what? The incredible stress put upon the individual who, every day  —   well, except for Obama, who only read half of them  —   but usually every day is given an intelligence brief that would make most people never sleep again. “The president’s daily briefing is the latest intelligence on what the bad guys are doing, whether it’s Russia, ISIS, North Korea, or what have you,” he explained, adding: And on top of that, they have to bear on their shoulders the responsibility that there’s always somebody walking within 20 yards of them, carrying the suitcase, the “football,” that allows them to launch a nuclear strike within minutes, should it be required to defend the United States. “That’s the level of stress. I mean, short of being a brain surgeon, or somebody like, you know, Ben Carson, who has to separate conjoined twins, there really are very few jobs comparable to being the    when it comes to stress levels,” he concluded. SiriusXM host Alex Marlow expressed doubt that Hillary Clinton, who collapsed during a   memorial on a pleasant morning on Sunday, would be able to handle that level of stress. He told Dr. Gorka there had been few takers, so far, on his offer to call in and apologize for doubting that Clinton’s health was a legitimate campaign issue.
