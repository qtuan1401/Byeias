Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina ordered 500, 000 people in eight different counties to evacuate due to the impending threat of Hurricane Matthew, but she says not enough people are following the advisories. [ABC News reported that only 175, 000 people evacuated out of the 500, 000.  “That’s not enough,” Haley said at news conference this morning. “We need more people evacuating. ” Haley urged residents to “fuel up quickly” and stock up on supplies before stores close. Several of the state’s public schools and government offices are already closed for the week. “Residents that don’t leave today will realize that nothing is open,” Haley said. According to ABC meteorologists, Hurricane Matthew is expected to be the strongest storm to hit the U. S. in more than a decade. The National Hurricane Center extended its hurricane warning and hurricane watch into Georgia and South Carolina as of 5 a. m. Thursday morning as the storm moved closer to Florida, ABC News reported.
