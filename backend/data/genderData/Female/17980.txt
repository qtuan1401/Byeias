A Connecticut couple is facing charges after police say they engaged in sexual activity in a parked car in front of a    boy who was in the back seat. [Police in Orange say the two McDonaldâ€™s employees were leaving the restaurant Nov. 15 when they spotted the couple having sex in the front seat of the car while the child was awake and alert in the back, the Associated Press reported.  When police arrived on the scene, they found Kimberly Onorato, 28, partially undressed, police say. Police said Onorato and Rory Clark, 27, stated to police that they were only cuddling. Clark and Onorato are both charged with impairing the morals of a minor and breach of the peace. Lawyers for the pair could not be found in the online court record system. Custody of the child was turned over to a relative. Police also contacted child welfare authorities. Police have caught several people engaged in sexual activity over the past few months. An Ohio woman was arrested for soliciting sex for nachos last week, and a woman in England was caught performing a sexual act on a model dinosaur.
