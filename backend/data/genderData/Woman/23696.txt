Twitter’s stock price is still nosediving after their controversial decision to remove Breitbart Technology Editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ verification badge earlier this month. [The declining social network had dropped sharply in the week that it removed Yiannopoulos’ verification badge, finishing down almost 14% over the last five days of trading.  Twitter continues to plunge in popularity while banning, suspending, and unverifying users, which Yiannopoulos claimed was a result of expressing conservative views, a view echoed not just by   outlets but also by publications like The Week and Buzzfeed.  This isn’t the only problem on the social network’s mind either, after Twitter went down this morning around the world due to a “technical fault,” according to Twitter’s official support account. The service issues started to be recorded around 8 AM GMT, and the entire website went down shortly after. Most users were able to access the site again at around 11 AM GMT after roughly three hours of outage, but there were still some users who were not able to use the service properly again until 3:30 PM, according to Down Detector. The hashtag #TwitterDown was trending worldwide during and after the debacle, and many users took to other social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, to complain about the disruption. It has not been a good month for Twitter their continued controversial actions and unexplained outages certainly aren’t helping. **UPDATE** Twitter’s stock value is currently tanking, down over 5% by 1 PM Eastern Time on Tuesday.
