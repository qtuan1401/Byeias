’  ’ ”   Nobody likes to be told that they’re paying more than the regular   price. ” ’   Uber seems to have gotten the message. ’ ’   Starting on Thursday, consumers who order an Uber ride will no   longer see the infamous ”surge” rate   the premium Uber charges   above its normal rate when demand for rides exceeds the number of   drivers available. ’ ’   Instead, Uber will show consumers the total price as soon as they   order a ride. ’ ’   The Uber app will calculate before you accept how much it costs   to get from point A to point B based on the distance, time,   traffic, and surge pricing. If the price ends up higher than the   typical fare, then Uber will note that it was increased because   of demand, but not by how much. ’ ’’ ”   The change means that you’ll have to type your destination into   the app before the ride from now on. ” ”   Uber says that showing the upfront fare will make its pricing   easier to understand. By showing one price for the ride,   consumers don’t have to do any math to estimate how much extra   they’ll pay because of, say, a 1. 7X surge. And there won’t be any   surprises when they see the final bill. ” ’  ’ ”   With the update, Uber is also doing away with the lightning bolts   to indicate that it’s surging, and there’s no longer an option to   be notified when the surge comes down, either. ” ”   Uber has had trouble with riders and surge pricing in the past.    for riders agreeing to high surge   prices without realizing that a 3. 5x ride means that they’ll end   up with a $215 bill. ” ”   The company has tried to curb the surprises by making riders   confirm the higher surge multiples before taking a ride, but even   then riders have been caught off guard. The latest change makes   it clear to riders before they get in what they’re going to be   paying, even if they won’t know how much more expensive it is   than a normal ride. ” ”Nobody likes to be told that they’re paying. ..”
