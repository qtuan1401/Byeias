Don’t save your tax refund check  —   spend it on travel. That is the message some tour operators, cruise lines and hotels want to get across this year, and with Tax Day approaching on April 18, they’re offering   trips and stays. Most are priced below $3, 000, the amount of the average tax refund in 2017, as of early March, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The South African Tourism office in the United States has created a   travel initiative of nine trips to entice aspiring travelers to visit the country. All cost about $3, 000 or less and include accommodations and some meals and activities most include airfare. Each trip is from a different tour operator  —   SmarTours, for example, has a   package that includes a stay in Cape Town and a safari in Kruger National Park. From $1, 799 a person. And Travel Discounters has a   itinerary that includes stays in Johannesburg and the Karongwe Game Reserve, where guests go on daily game drives. From $2, 199 a person. Bangu Masisi, the president of South African Tourism in North America, said the tax season was an ideal opportunity to show that a trip to South Africa is within reach. “Most people think that a vacation to South Africa is out of their budget, but these trips prove that it’s more affordable than they may imagine,” she said. The travel company STA Travel has two “TaxPerience” trips both are available throughout 2017 and include flights, internal transfers, accommodations, tours and some meals and activities. The   “Northern Hilltribes and Villages” package includes stays in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, but the heart of the trip is exploring more rural northern Thailand  —   there, travelers visit villages to learn about the local culture and cuisine and also go on guided   treks through the countryside. From $1, 295 a person. The second trip is a   “Cambodia Experience,” in which travelers visit not only Angkor Wat and Siem Reap in Cambodia but also Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and Bangkok in Thailand. From $1, 641 a person. Cruise fans can consider the two “Tax Refund” journeys from Variety Cruises, both available throughout 2017: a   cruise of the Greek Islands, including stops in Santorini and Mykonos (from $2, 695 a person) or an   cruise around Iceland, with stops in the cities of Siglufjordur and Reykjavik (from $2, 950 a person).
