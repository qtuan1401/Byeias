Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton portrays herself as the victim of sexism, explaining during an interview that she suffers from it at her own campaign rallies. [She said that people would come up to her on the rope line and say, “‘I really admire you, I really like you, I just don’t know if I can vote for a woman to be president,’” she said in an interview with New York Magazine. “I mean, they come to my events and then they say that to me. ”  She added she thinks Americans are afraid that a woman’s ambition would crowd out relationships, marriage, children, family, and home making. “We’re so accustomed to think of women’s ambition being made manifest in ways that we don’t approve of, or that we find  . ” She said that Americans viewed a woman’s ambition as “dangerous” and that men were “100 percent” afraid of the competition. “That level of visceral   …     fear, anxiety, insecurity plays a role,” she said. But Mrs. Clinton said she would continue pressing forward in spite of the headwinds she faced because of her sex. “I’m just trying to cope with it. Deal with it. Live through it,” she said, laughing. In the interview, Clinton explained what it was like to live with Bill Clinton when they were both in their Chappaqua home. “We get back to the house and stay in the kitchen and talk and maybe eat something bad, maybe drink something bad,” she said referring to beer or wine. “We watch TV, like the hundreds of shows we record and finally get to. Then go to bed and read for a while before we fall asleep. ”
