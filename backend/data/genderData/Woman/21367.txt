On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” House Democratic Whip Representative Steny Hoyer ( ) stated that Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should have disclosed her pneumonia diagnosis when she received it on Friday and “she ought to release a full medical report to make sure that the people understand that she is fully able to carry out the duties of president of the United States. ”  Hoyer was asked, “We had Robby Mook on earlier, this is Clinton’s Campaign Manager. We talked about this issue around the pneumonia, and he said that Hillary didn’t want to, quote, disrupt the campaign by disclosing it on Friday. Should she have done so?” He answered, “Yes, I think she should have. And I frankly think she ought to release a full medical report to make sure that the people understand that she is fully able to carry out the duties of president of the United States. This is a woman who’s been going hard for over a year. You saw her on the debate  —   on the     —   well, it wasn’t really a debate, but two presentations. She looked strong. She  —  obviously, in full control of her thinking, gave answers to complex questions showing her full breadth of knowledge. So, no doubt in my mind she is fully able to be president of the United States. She’s got pneumonia. You’ve got pneumonia, you get weak, and she probably shouldn’t have been there, but it was   and she felt a responsibility to be there. She probably made a judgement of error. But I think that we ought to have a full medical report from credible medical sources that know her health status, and I think they’re going to give her a clean bill of health, and she ought to release that. ” (  Washington Free Beacon) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
