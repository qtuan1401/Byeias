Recently published information reveals that Erik Olin Wright, a professor who teaches a course bashing capitalism at the University of Wisconsin, earns an annual salary of $170, 000. [A syllabus for Professor Wright’s class, entitled “Class, State, and Ideology: An Introduction to Social Science in the Marxist Tradition,” was published only by the free   MacIver Institute.  The syllabus claims that the course covers the Marxist tradition and its “radical critics of capitalism as an economic system and social order. ” Wright argues that a study of the Marxist tradition gives students the tools to understand the “radical egalitarian project of social change. ” Wright, a tenured professor at the University of Wisconsin’s Sociology Department, makes $116, 111 more than the average household income in Wisconsin. His $170, 000 annually salary also places him in the top two percent of all Americans. Wright has written extensively on “radical democratic egalitarianism,” and believes that the inequities by a capitalist economic and social order “perpetuates eliminable forms of human suffering. ” It is unclear if Wright believes his membership in the top two percent of American income earners makes him a willing participant in the nation’s capitalistic economic order that causes “human suffering. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
