’  ’ ’   Retailers are bracing for a fresh wave of store closures at the   start of the new year.  ’ ’   The industry is heading into 2017 with a glut of store space as   shopping continues to shift online and foot traffic to malls   declines, according to analysts. ’ ’    ’ ’  ’ ”   Nearly every major department store, including   Macy’s, Kohl’s, Walmart, and Sears, have collectively   closed hundreds of stores over the last couple   years to try and stem losses from unprofitable stores and   the rise of ecommerce.  ” ’’ ’   But the closures are far from over. ’ ’Sears is shuttering  by April, and additional   closures are expected to be announced soon.   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   As stores continue to close, many shopping malls will be forced   to shut down as well. ’ ’   When an anchor store like Sears or Macy’’s closes, it   often triggers a ”downward spiral in performance” for   shopping malls, Morningstar analysts wrote in the   report from October. ’ ’   The malls don’’t only lose the income and shopper traffic from   that store’’s business. The closure often triggers   ”  clauses” that allow the remaining mall   tenants to exercise their right to terminate their leases or   renegotiate the terms, typically with a period of lower   rents, until another retailer moves into the vacant anchor   space.  ’ ’      ’ ’   That can have ”grave” consequences for shopping   malls, especially in markets where it’’s harder to transform   vacant mall space into   space like apartments,   according to the analysts. ’ ’   The Morningstar report supports another recent analysis from   Credit Suisse .  ’
