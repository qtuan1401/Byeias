A Starbucks worker’s act of kindness to a group of New York Police Department (NYPD) officers in the wake of the weekend’s terrorist attacks is going viral. [The worker, known as Germaine, handed out free coffee and food to the officers working the scene of Saturday night’s explosion in Chelsea that injured 29 people.   “I wish I could give a little more,” he said as he handed over the Starbucks treats. The police officers thanked Germaine and shook his hand. Germaine, in response to the attention, said in another video that “it was the least he could do” for the officers. “It was the least I could do,” Germaine said. “You know, these guys run from danger and to danger, and I just figured why not?” The video has been viewed more than nine million times and shared more than 135, 000 times since Knight News, a University of Central Florida news outlet, posted it on Sunday. NYPD officers have been working overtime to catch the suspect, who was caught in a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey.
