Hillary Clinton enlists actor Morgan Freeman, Hollywood’s “voice of God,” to narrate her latest campaign ad, entitled, “All The Good. ”[“Her church taught her to do all the good you can for all the people you can, for as long as you can,” Freeman says as images of Hillary Clinton sitting with children appear on the screen.  The ad is scheduled to air on February 27 in South Carolina, just days before Palmetto State voters head to the polls. “After law school, she could have joined a   law firm, but instead she worked to reform juvenile justice in South Carolina,” Freeman says in his famously deep voice. “Her life’s work has been about breaking barriers and so would her presidency. ” Hilary Clinton called for an end to the “   pipeline” Tuesday at a campaign event in Harlem, New York. Both Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been battling each other in an effort to win over black voters in South Carolina and other southern states. Clinton’s climb is a bit more steep than the socialist senator from Vermont. “From the crime bill to welfare reform, policies Bill Clinton enacted —  and Hillary Clinton supported —  decimated black America,” wrote legal scholar Michele Alexander in a viral post for the ultra liberal The Nation website. “Hillary Clinton should ask for Black America’s forgiveness before she asks for their votes,” one writer said in the liberal Huffington Post. Morgan Freeman is expected to campaign for Hillary Clinton in an upcoming appearance on CNN. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
