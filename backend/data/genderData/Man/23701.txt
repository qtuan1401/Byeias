Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Senator Claire McCaskill ( ) said the original reason for the FBI investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private unsecured email server during her tenure as secretary of state was “legitimate. ”  McCaskill said, “The overall investigation exists because there was a legitimate question as to whether or not Hillary Clinton had done something against the law as it related to classified  . And I believe that investigation was very thorough. Now, they have a few more   to look at. By the way, they have almost 14, 000 FBI agents and a budget of $8. 5 billion. Seems they could get busy and look at these and tell us by the end of the week. ”
