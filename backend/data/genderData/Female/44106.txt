’  ’ ’   The NFL hopes to make watching its games a little less painful. ’ ’ Goodell said   the NFL is looking for ways to improve the speed of the game,   including addressing the number of TV breaks and the length of   those breaks. ’ ’   With networks showing  during the 2016   season, games can often run long, with frequent breaks in game   play. Additionally, as of 2014,  with 24% of the   broadcast showing commercials. ’ ’   Goodell himself called the experience ”annoying,” saying the NFL   hopes to ”eliminate” it. ’ ’’ ”   Of course, this is the NFL just saying they plan on making   changes  —   they haven’t actually done so yet. ” ’   In the letter, Goodell says the NFL has already agreed to make   some changes. One such change is installing a play clock   following extra points when there isn’’t a commercial break. The   NFL is also going to ”standardize the starting of the clock after   a runner goes out of bounds” and standardize the length of   halftimes. ’ ’   Other changes are still under consideration and in need of   voting. Goodell said NFL owners are going to vote on instituting   ”centralized” replay, in which referees watch replays on a   tablet, in consultation with a review center in New York. The   hope is to speed up the reviews while also improving the   accuracy. The NFL is also considering installing a play clock   after touchdowns. ’ ”   With football seemingly becoming less popular across America   (though it’s still easily the most popular sport) and the NFL’s   television ratings suffering in 2016, it’s smart of the league to   consider changes. With a high number of breaks in the action,   hopefully a few tweaks can improve the television experience. ” ’The NFL hopes to make watching its games a. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
