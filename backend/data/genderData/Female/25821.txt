Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says she will “get to the bottom” of UFOs and space aliens during her presidential term, because we may have already experienced the quiet visitation of extraterrestrial beings. [“Yes, I’m going to get to the bottom of it,” Clinton told the New Hampshire newspaper Conway Daily Sun in an interview.  “I think we may have been (visited already). We don’t know for sure. ”  Though her husband Bill Clinton told Jimmy Kimmel that he checked it out and found no evidence that alien spacecrafts were ever recovered by the U. S. federal government, Hillary Clinton remains, like Scully of “ ” fame, an   skeptic. Though UFOs spotted near Roswell, New Mexico in the 1940s were likely experimental aircraft being tested during the Cold War, some   have put forth the view that Biblical angels were actually historic depictions of alien visitors.
