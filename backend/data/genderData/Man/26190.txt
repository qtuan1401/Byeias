Monday on MSNBC while discussing the FBI reopening the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Democratic strategist and long time Clinton ally James Carville said FBI Director James Comey is “acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans. ”  Carville said, “He was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans. End of story. He gave the letter to him. They gave it to Fox News. We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race, selectively leaking this from the Clinton campaign that they had. So American democracy is really under attack here. And the question is really, how are we and in particular, how are Democrats going to respond to this? We have to understand this is really, really quite extraordinary. It would seem to me that the FBI  should be getting rolled by the House Republicans. That’s what is happening here. There is nothing else that is going on. And in the meantime, we do know that our democracy is under assault by the KGB. ” “To me that is something we ought to be talking about,” he continued. “That’s is a very pertinent and relevant issue in this campaign. People have to decide, do we want our country for ourselves and the people in charge, or are we going to let the KGB and the House Republicans decide this election?” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
