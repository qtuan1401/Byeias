On Tuesday’s “MSNBC Live,” MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell said that FBI Director James Comey completely disputed presumptive Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s claims that she never sent or received anything that was classified at the time and Comey’s announcement “is a big political hit. It is not the complete exoneration that they would have hoped for. ”  Mitchell stated Hillary “has been saying for more than a year now that she never sent or received anything that was classified at the time, and his [FBI Director James Comey’s] analysis completely disputes that, her main argument. He speaks of the carelessness of it. He also spoke to the fact that it was likely hacked by hostile actors, that would mean Russia, China, even possibly North Korea, the major Internet and cyberwar actors. The fact that she used her devices overseas, that it was careless to use  —   to have classified information stored, not just on the private server, but the fact that she was passing information back and forth to people in the State Department, and they were using the unclassified State Department system, not the classified system. so the carelessness, and the criticism of that carelessness at the State Department, which he said was unusual in the US government, is also on her watch. This is politically very damaging, not as damaging as a prosecution obviously, not as legally fraught as a prosecution would be, which could be disabling for a nominee  —   a presumptive nominee, just weeks before the convention. But the fact is, this is a big political hit. It is not the complete exoneration that they would have hoped for. ” (  Washington Free Beacon) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
