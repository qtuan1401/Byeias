Asked by Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon how he viewed Britain’s upcoming vote on leaving the European Union, Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney said, “There’s a lot more riding on it than just what’s in store for Britain. I think that when British voters cast their ballots tomorrow, they may be deciding, really, freedom’s last chance in Europe. ”[Gaffney added:  What’s been happening to Europe over the last couple of decades, in particular, has been not only the crushing regulation and galloping socialism dictated by unaccountable bureaucrats, or Eurocrats, as they’re called in Brussels, not just this problem of it not being permissible for member nations to control their borders, or have their own immigration policies, which has contributed to the disaster that’s taking place there now  —   we also have Europeans being prosecuted for speech that the Eurocrats, the Islamists, the   Left deem to be hateful. So, if Britain does, in fact, bail on this, I believe there’s a chance that other nations will follow suit. If it doesn’t, I think you’re going to see more of this, and it’s going be a triumph for the   and they’ve got their sights set on us. I hope to God we’ll see Britain vote to exit tomorrow.
