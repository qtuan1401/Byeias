According to ABC15, Wilke called the police about thirty minutes after the incident and said that her boyfriend was laughing after disclosing he has HIV. Wilke said her boyfriend pushed her, pulled a knife on her, and cut her arm. That’s when she jumped in her car and drove away, she stated. Wilke said she realized she hit someone but did not know how her boyfriend got in front of the vehicle. Police said they did find a small cut on Wilke’s arm.
