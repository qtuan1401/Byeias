On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. Tom Cotton ( ) said the   U. N. resolution that the Obama administration declined to veto could only be voted on and passed with “explicit United States coordination. ”[Cotton said, “Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows how the real world works and the United Nations Security Council works. Senegal and Malaysia, some of the countries that sponsored the resolution, don’t call the shots there. If Barack Obama and John Kerry and Samantha Power hadn’t been speaking for months about the prospect of this resolution and had not been creating a climate inside the security council to let it come forward without firmly saying we will veto any     resolution, no country would have brought that resolution forward. It only could have been brought forward and passed with explicit United States coordination with other members of the security council. ”  Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
