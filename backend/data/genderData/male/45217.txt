’  ’ ’   The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are ”deep” into trade   discussions revolving around the Celtics’’ No. 1 pick in this   year’’s draft, according to reports from ESPN and Yahoo. ’ ’ that the two teams are having   ”serious” trade talks. ’ ’ saying presumed No. 1 pick   Markelle Fultz could be visiting Philadelphia on Saturday, a sign   of how advanced the talks are. ’ ”   According to Stein and ESPN’s Zach Lowe, the deal is expected to   only involve picks, no players. That could mean a swap of the   Celtics’ No. 1 pick and and the 76ers’ No. 3 pick this year, plus   a future first from the Sixers. ” ’   With the draft less than a week away, the deal could signal a     for both teams. The 76ers, with a core that includes   Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, and Ben Simmons, could add another       and the top prospect in the draft in   Fultz.  ’ ’’ ”   The Celtics, meanwhile, would continue plotting for the future   and collecting assets, biding their time until they find the   right move. While the No. 1 pick would obviously be nice, there’s   been debate over how much the Celtics would want a player like   Fultz when they have thrived with Isaiah Thomas handling   playmaking duties. With the No. 3 pick, they could perhaps take a   player like Kansas’ Josh Jackson, an athletic, defensive wing   that would fit their roster better. ” ”   The deal could also affect how other teams draft. For example, if   the 76ers were higher on UCLA’s Lonzo Ball than Fultz, perhaps   they would want to jump to No. 1 to take Ball before the Lakers,   who are heavily rumored to be interested in Ball. That could   leave the Lakers to look elsewhere, and could affect other teams’   boards. ” ’   Such a trade still has plenty of time to happen, but a deal for   No. 1 is somewhat rare in the NBA and could have some     ramifications.  ’ ’The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
