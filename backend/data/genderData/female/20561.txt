Hillary Clinton’s campaign will get a shot of Broadway star power in July when the presumptive Democrat presidential nominee hosts a fundraiser at a special performance of the smash hit musical Hamilton. [The Clinton campaign has rented out the entirety of the   Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City for a matinee performance of Hamilton on July 12, according to ABC News. Those who want to support Clinton’s presidential campaign and catch the usually   Broadway hit at the same time will pay between $2, 700 and $100, 000 for the opportunity.  Clinton will reportedly be in attendance during the Tuesday afternoon performance, which is set to take place just three days after Hamilton creator and star   Miranda takes his final bow on July 9. The $2, 700 ticket gets one a seat inside the theater, while those who contribute $10, 000 can have their picture taken with the candidate, according to Deadline. Supporters who kick in $33, 400 get an invite to a wrap party with Clinton following the show, while $100, 000   contributors get two preferred seats, an invitation to the wrap party and also an invitation to the Democrat National Convention. Those without the cash can enter to win a seat at the fundraiser in a contest. All proceeds from the event will go towards the Hillary Victory Fund joint fundraising committee. Earlier this month, Politico reported that Democrats are courting Hamilton star   Miranda for a performance at the Democrat National Convention in July. Miranda has a busy summer ahead and may not be able to make it (and his father says there’s “no truth” to Politico’s report) so this may be an alternative way for the Clinton campaign to cash in on Hamilton‘s popularity, even though Miranda himself won’t perform at the fundraiser. Hamilton picked up 11 Tony Awards off of a record 16 nominations earlier this month. Premium seats during a regular performance, when they can be gotten, go for $849 per ticket.
