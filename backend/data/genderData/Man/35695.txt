Washington (CNN) Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Sunday that the Justice Department probe into Hillary Clinton’s emails is being conducted the same as similar investigations and that she has not discussed it with President Barack Obama.  ”I don’t get involved in whom the President endorses and I don’t have comments, as I said before, on any of the candidates,” said Lynch when asked on ”Fox News Sunday” if her status as a political appointee by Obama created a conflict of interest for her now that Obama has endorsed Clinton. ”The investigation into the State Department email matter is going to be handled like any other matter. We’ve got career agents and lawyers looking at that. They will follow the facts and follow the evidence wherever it leads and come to a conclusion,” she said. Lynch said she has not discussed the investigation with Obama or anyone else in the White House. ”We’ve never discussed the Clinton case. I have never spoken about it with the President or really with anyone at the White House. That’s not the kind of relationship that I have with people there, and it would be inappropriate to do so,” she said.  Lynch made similar comments on NBC’s ”Meet the Press” on Sunday, saying the investigation was ”free from politics,” and deflected a question of whether she should recuse herself.  ”I say let the career prosecutors and agents do their job and continue in this matter,” she said.
