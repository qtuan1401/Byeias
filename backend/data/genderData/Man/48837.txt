’  ’ ’   The Cleveland Browns lost   to the New England Patriots on   Sunday, but it was Browns receiver Andrew Hawkins who had the   best touchdown celebration of the day. ’ ’   In the first quarter, Hawkins caught an   touchdown pass   from Cody Kessler. ’ ”   Afterward, Hawkins seemed to remember the NFL’s new strict   celebration rules and opted not to get fined. Instead, he dropped   the ball and walked away, robotically, seemingly mocking the way   the NFL wants players to behave. ” ”   Here’s the play: ” ’ ’ ’   Perhaps Hawkins learned from Steelers wide receiver Antonio   Brown, who has thus far been fined over $48, 000 for dancing in   the end zone. ’ ”   The strict rules against celebrations aren’t fun, but if more   players begin getting creative and frankly, weird, like Hawkins,   we’re okay with it.  ”
