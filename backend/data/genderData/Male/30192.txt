New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that criticisms of President Obama for staying at a baseball game in Cuba and continuing his trip to Argentina after the Brussels terror attack are “unfounded” and “political  ” on Friday’s “PBS NewsHour. ”  Brooks said, “I think those criticisms are unfounded. The president  —   we have a big government. We can do a lot of things at once. If the president had skipped the baseball game, and gone home, what more could he have done? I mean, he has a telephone. He can make decisions. He can have meetings. It’s my basic principle that that’s just political  . It’s my most fundamental basic principle, there’s never a good reason to miss a baseball game. And so his decision to do that, I fully support that. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
