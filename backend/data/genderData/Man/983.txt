MANILA  —   A fire raced through a squalid Manila shantytown teeming with people on Tuesday night, as residents armed only with buckets of water tried to fight the inferno. As day broke on Wednesday, more than 15, 000 people found themselves homeless, bereft of their few worldly possessions and forced to sleep on the Philippine capital’s streets. “It spread fast across the neighboring homes made of light materials,” said Wilberto Tiu, Manila’s fire chief. “Firemen had trouble reaching the area because of small alleyways,” Mr. Tiu said of the warren of closely built homes, some constructed of no more than plywood and scrap metal. He said the alleys between homes were too narrow for fire trucks. Residents tried to outrun the blaze, grabbing whatever they could carry: pots and pans, family pets, washing machines and electric fans. Dozens of people were injured in the stampede, but miraculously, officials said, no one was killed. The blaze had been brought under control by Wednesday morning. Fires in the country’s slums are a regular occurrence. About 1, 200 families were left without homes in January after a fire in Navotas, a suburb of Manila. Residents of shantytowns are at particular risk in the months of February and March, as the weather warms and the rains stop, officials said. In March 2015, more than 7, 000 families were left homeless when a blaze tore through the same slum, Parola Compound, near the capital’s main port. In 2014, the homes of at least 2, 500 families in the slum were destroyed in a predawn blaze. Investigators said they believed Tuesday’s blaze was caused by faulty electrical wiring or a malfunctioning gas stove. By Wednesday morning, hundreds of families were left to sleep on the street, some at a makeshift shelter at a covered basketball court, disaster officials said. Television footage showed children sleeping on sidewalks along streets near the slum, as health workers distributed food and other supplies.
