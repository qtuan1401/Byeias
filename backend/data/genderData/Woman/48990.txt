’  ’ ”   Former star major league pitcher and conservative firebrand Curt   Schilling, who’s  a run for Sen. Elizabeth   Warren’s Massachusetts Senate seat in 2018, asked CNN’s Jake   Tapper to explain why Jews support Democrats in a Friday   interview. ” ’   ”I would like to ask you a question honestly Jake,” Schilling   said, to which Tapper agreed. ’ ”   The   World Series champion asked if Tapper was voting   for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Tapper said no, adding   that he doesn’t vote in presidential races. ” ’   ”Okay, so I would like to ask you something as a   person who’’s practicing the Jewish faith and has since you   were young,” Schilling then said. ”I don’’t understand  —   and maybe   this is the amateur   in me  —   I don’’t understand how   people of the Jewish faith can back the Democratic Party   which over the last 50 years has been so clearly     so clearly   Israel.” ’ ’   He added that he doesn’’t know what else would have to be ”done,   said, or happen” for people to understand that the only reason   Democrats have to be ”aligned with Israel” is because of   diplomatic agreements. ’ ’   Tapper, who is Jewish, answered that he doesn’’t ”speak for Jews”   or support either major political party. He added that Jewish   support for Democrats might have more to do with the party’’s   support for social welfare programs than for Israel, and that   many staunchly   Jews do support the Republican   Party.  ’ ’   But ”I don’’t speak for Jews,” he repeated. ’ ’   ”I know you don’’t,” Schilling responded. ”I just always find it a   great conversation for somebody of your faith, because I   want to understand the reasons behind some of those things,   so I appreciate that.” ’ ’   Earlier, Schilling said that his eventual choice to run for   Senate will be ”completely” a family decision. ’ ’’ ’. to : ”I don’’t understand how people of Jewish faith can back the Democratic Party” ’
