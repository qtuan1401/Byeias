That’s not right by anyone’s standards. ” Kaepernick’s birth mother Heidi Russo criticized the quarterback, accusing him of bringing shame to the family. “There’s ways to make change without disrespecting and bringing shame to the very country and family who afforded you so many blessings,” she wrote on Twitter. @Kaepernick7 There’s ways to make change   disrespecting  bringing shame to the very country  family who afforded you so many blessings.  —   Heidi Russo (@Heidirn1) August 27, 2016,  In July, Kaepernick shared his thoughts on Instagram after two black Americans were shot by police officers. “This is what lynchings look like in 2016!” he said. “Another murder in the streets because the color of a man’s skin, at the hands of the people who they say will protect us. “We are under attack!” he wrote a day later. “It’s clear as day!
