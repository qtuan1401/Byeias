’  ’ ’   The Cleveland Cavaliers are  with the Atlanta Hawks for   sharpshooter Kyle Korver. ’ ’   As the Hawks begin what looks like the early stages of a   rebuilding project, the Cavaliers come out as winners of the   trade, acquiring one of the best   shooters in the NBA. ’ ”   Korver’s addition would make the Cavaliers  —   a team already   stocked with shooters and capable scorers  —   even tougher to   defend. ” ”   And there’s reason to be optimistic that Korver would be even   better with the Cavs. Korver, a career 43%   shooter   who’s led the NBA over the last decade in made threes, has never   played with a passer like LeBron James. As defenses inevitably   gear up to stop James or any of the Cavs’ other scorers, Korver   should be basking in open    opportunities. ” ’   On Friday, Kevin Love told reporters what his advice would be for   Korver, summarizing how easy his job should be once he lands in   Cleveland: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tKevin Love’’s advice to Kyle Korver on playing with LeBron: ”When you catch the ball, shoot it. ”’t’t’ ’   No need to overthink it. ’ ”   That shouldn’t be too hard for Korver. This season, James has   been passing better than ever, averaging 8. 5 assists per game,     of an assist shy of his career high. James has even   taken it upon himself to become the best playmaker possible by      when they shoot it. If Korver likes to catch the ball up high and   shoot it with the laces, for example, James would learn that and   deliver the ball to him that way, at least according to James. ” ”   The Cavs are fifth in the NBA in offensive rating this season,   scoring 110 points per 100 possessions. They’re also second in   the made threes per game, canning 13 per contest. With Korver,   both numbers should rise, and he should enjoy a bounty of open   looks from beyond the arc. ”
