A driver in Albany, NY learned a lesson in patience Tuesday.  In the dash cam footage, an impatient BMW driver honks his horn and yells at the driver in the car in front of him after the car in front slows down to allow a school bus to merge. As the cars drive onto the upcoming   the BMW attempts to speed around the car in front and then hits an orange barrel. The BMW collides with the school bus and goes up on top of the concrete barrier. Once the driver got out, he yelled, “I thought there was another lane!” Fox 4 reports commenters are saying the ramp has always had one lane, but recently added the concrete barrier, making the road more narrow. No serious injuries were reported from the incident. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
