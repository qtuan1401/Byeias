Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos opened up an exclusive screening of the documentary film Clinton Cash at Tower Cinemas in Cleveland today. [Speaking to a packed theater, Yiannopoulos explained that the film opened his eyes to just how corrupt Bill and Hillary actually were.  “It’s a very terrifying film, don’t expect to leave with a smile on your face,” he said, addressing attendees who were in town for the Republican National Convention. Yiannopoulos urged everyone to see the film despite their politics, to get a taste of how the Clintons would operate if Hillary was elected president. “I started to discover just how horrifying the idea of this family in the White House again would be,” he said. Yiannopoulos asserted that the New York best selling book was “  on the facts” despite failed attempts by the liberal media to discredit Breitbart Senior    Peter Schweizer’s work. He also introduced the Clinton Cash graphic novel prior to the screening. “The artwork’s amazing, it’s really good,” Yiannopoulos said. The world premiere of the film debuts on Breitbart News this weekend.
