A recent poll from Rasmussen Reports shows the NRA’s favorable rating is 54% and a Gallup poll shows that Hillary Clinton’s favorable rating is 41%. [This is an interesting contrast when one considers that Clinton purposely confronted the NRA as a way to differentiate between herself and other Democrat primary candidates in the fall of 2015. The New York Times reported on her October 16, 2015 appearance in Keene, N. H. in which Clinton “promised to take on the [NRA] in aggressively pressing for gun control. ”  She released an ad that same month in which she said, “I will not be silenced. I will keep taking on the NRA. ” At this point, favorable ratings show the NRA is ahead in the battle. According to Rasmussen,  “54% of likely U. S. Voters now view the NRA favorably. ” That is a 5% increase from the 49% who viewed the civil rights organization favorably in January 2013, weeks after the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary. On the other hand, Gallup‘s poll of “national adults” shows Clinton’s favorable rating is 41%. In March 2016 the Chicago Tribune warned that Clinton might be defeating herself by taking on the NRA, thereby encouraging more than 100 million gun owners to go to the polls and vote against her. Clinton’s husband took on the NRA to secure an “assault weapons” ban during his first term in office and watched Congressional Republicans secure historical victories as a result.
