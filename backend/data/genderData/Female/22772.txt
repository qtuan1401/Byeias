Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” during his appearance, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio touted the candidacy of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.    Mika Brzezinski referenced a moment during a rally for Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) in Iowa which he seemed to connect with a woman who was struggling financially and asked how Clinton could do the same, given the speaking fees she has collected over the years. “[T]he question I would have for someone like you who supports Hillary Clinton is explain to me how that woman, who struggles to get by on $10, 000 a year, can relate to a candidate who maybe has made $600, 000 in one year from speeches at Goldman Sachs, and knew she was going to be running for president, who pushed her husband to veto a bankruptcy bill and then voted for it as senator,”  Brzezinski said. “How does that woman relate, when she is struggling just to get by every day, when she has a degree?” De Blasio argued Clinton had been a champion for health care, taking on the health insurance providers and lobbying for other benefits for women and children. However, Brzezinski was skeptical that she could related based on her incomes. “I guess the question was how can that woman relate to Hillary Clinton, especially in light of even the money that she raised for big banks in the year before she decided to run for president, knowing that she was going to run for president?” Brzezinski said. “How can that woman relate to her?” De Blasio insisted Clinton would be the right candidate to fix the problem. “That woman needs a president who will fix the problem,” de Blasio said. “That woman needs a president who is going to go into office, raise minimum wage, raise benefits for working families, paid family leave, paid sick leave, these type of things, and bluntly, tax the wealthy more. Hillary Clinton’s platform says that. ”   (  WFB) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
