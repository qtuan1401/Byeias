’  ’ ’   In the last year or so, most of your credit, debit, and ATM cards   have probably been replaced with chip cards. ’ ’  ’ ’     Vendors were encouraged to begin accepting chip transactions     (aka “chip and dip”) by Oct. 1, 2015, a transition date chosen     by the payment network industry. As of that date,      for fraudulent charges made at their establishments if they     didn’t have a working chip reader.   ’ ’     At the same time, financial institutions that don’t provide     their customers with chip cards became liable for fraud. It’s     an industry shift not motivated or enforced by the government,     and the idea was to encourage everyone to transition quickly to     the new, more secure chip technology.   ’ ’     Chip cards have long been in use in Europe, and elsewhere     around the world, because they reduce fraud compared to     magnetic strip cards. When chip technology proliferated during     the 1990s, U. S. payment networks had better fraud protections     than networks in other parts of the world, so there was less     motivation to adopt chips. At the time, the U. S. was already     doing   transactions in which a network verified on the     spot that a card had the funds available to cover the cost of     the purchase and hadn’t been reported lost or stolen. In Europe     and elsewhere, many transactions were still being done offline:     The merchant recorded the customer’s card information but     didn’t actually process it until later or even the next day.     This approach is much more vulnerable to fraud.       transactions have become more common around the world, but with      and  booming, the U. S. has     been overdue to adopt chip technology.   ’ ’     Much of the transition to chip cards (also referred to as EMV     cards, which stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, the     three companies who developed the technology standard) has been     frustrating and confusing for consumers. For one thing, you     still have to swipe your card at many vendors. Visa says that     1. 2 million U. S. stores had enabled chip transactions as of May     31, a 467 percent increase over the same time last year. And     since the transition kicked into high gear in October, Visa     estimates that an average of 23, 000 merchants bring chip     terminals online every week. But the  in February that the total number of U. S.     merchants is more like 8 million. Some market surveys have more     optimistic conclusions about the rate of adoption, but all seem     to place it . We’re not     there yet.   ’ ’     Timing was part of what slowed things down. The October     liability transition coincided with the start of the holiday     shopping season, and pundits agree that retailers were wary of     implementing a large systemic change during their busiest     season. Additionally, some stores have purchased new payment     terminals but still don’t accept chip transactions. You’ve     probably encountered a cashier at least once who said, No,     we don’t use chips yet, just swipe, when you tried to dip     your card. It’s noticeable because hundreds of millions of     cards have now been replaced, and the vast majority of     consumers have chip cards in hand. But the EMV Migration     Forum  in March     that U. S. stores have about 5 million   terminals     even though, as Visa and the Forum both point out, only a     little more than 1 million have started actually accepting EMV     transactions. This means you’re much more likely to encounter a     terminal that looks like it can accept chip cards rather than     one that actually can.   ’ ’  ’ ’     Flipping the switch so a store can accept EMV payments is     actually a multistep process. First they have to buy the     terminals, which run about $500 each. Then they have to install     software so the chip transactions can interoperate with their     current payment system. Finally, they need to be certified by     the banks and card networks that they work with. (Meaning a     store that doesn’t accept American Express doesn’t need to be     certified by them.) And that last requirement has been creating     a bottleneck. As J. Craig Shearman from the National Retail     Federation  in April, “It’s     time for the bank and the card industry to step up.   …     Some of     [our members] have had to wait months to get anybody to certify     their systems. ” There seems to be some movement on this issue     since companies like  and  announced     plans in June to spur EMV adoption and simplify the     certification procedure for new chip readers.   ’ ’     Though the process is rocky, most stores will ultimately accept     chip cards, especially large chains. Opting to be       isn’t illegal —  it just places fraud liability on merchants —  so     small stores that don’t experience a lot of fraud may gamble     and not upgrade their equipment and systems. Additionally,     certain industries that have very low credit card fraud rates,     like the dental industry, may be slow to transition.   ’ ’       A confusing aspect of this transition that the U. S. is using       the chip and signature model instead of the chip       and PIN approach used in Europe and most of the world.       In most places, customers enter a PIN on a keypad after       dipping their chip card, but in the U. S. customers are asked       to sign after they dip their chip much like the old system       with magnet strip credit cards. Since  are often more like       incomprehensible squiggles, though, it seems logical that       PINs would offer more security. But the banks and other       credit institutions that supported chip and signature for the       United States  and       often say that adding a PIN number to every transaction        for       consumers.     ’ ’       Chip and PIN made offline transactions more secure by asking       a customer to enter the same PIN that was encrypted and       stored locally on the chip. But chip and signature advocates       argue that this offline environment isn’t necessarily       relevant to payment networks today and that the adaptive       fraud detection software financial institutions use is       increasingly robust. Many small chip transactions, usually       under $25, don’t even require a signature anymore.       Furthermore, some advocates point out that PINs mainly offer       additional protection against the physical theft of a card,       and though this type of crime is still an issue, it has been       thoroughly eclipsed by online credit card fraud —  where PINs       don’t offer additional protection.     ’ ’       There are        though. A group of small business owners  that they would feel more       comfortable with the security of a chip and PIN system than       the chip and signature approach that has rolled out. And Mike       Cook, a senior vice president and the assistant treasurer at               in April 2015, “The fact that we didn’t go to PIN is such a       joke. ”   was one of the first U. S. vendors to accept       chip transactions, but in May the company        alleging that the payment network has forced the         giant to give customers the choice between using their debit       PIN or just signing.   wants to be able to mandate       that its customers use their PINs. These transactions are       cheaper for   to process, but the company claims it’s       a   for consumers because using a PIN is also more       secure.     ’ ’  ’ ’       Richard Willis, a partner in the payments systems group at       the corporate law firm Alston & Bird explained in an       email, “No one is clamoring for a PIN, consumers certainly       are not, so doing the bare minimum necessary —  which for most       is Chip and Signature —  makes business sense. Seen this way,       it’s a classic   analysis   …     and no other         forces (e. g. consumer demand) are driving the       broader move to PIN and its incremental benefits to       security. ”     ’ ’       The EMV technical standard allows card issuers to choose       whether they want to use a    or          approach, so financial institutions could decide that they       want to offer PINs at any time; . In April,       Visa reported that counterfeit fraud had dropped 26 percent       at vendors processing chip transactions during January, but        that the U. S.       still has one of the worst rates of credit card fraud in the       world overall. As Josephine Wolff        last August, “new card technology may do more to shift       how fraud happens and who has to pay for it than       actually reduce it in the long term. ”     ’ ’       So there’s a lot going on behind the scenes at credit card       companies and retail stores alike. But you’re probably       thinking about something else: Why the hell does it take       so long to process a chip transaction?! Surveys show       that        and you may have noticed anecdotally that chip transactions       take longer, require more standing around, and are       susceptible to problems if you take your card out of a reader       too soon. But the industry says you’re wrong. “Consumers may       think that it feels a little bit longer because the card is       in the terminal the whole time instead of just swiping it and       sticking it right back in your wallet,” said Stephanie       Ericksen, Visa’s vice president of risk products. “But the       actual transaction itself is taking the same amount of time.       It’s just that you’re watching your card be there while the       information is going out and coming back. ”     ’ ’ and       other major card issuers have slowly acknowledged that EMV       transactions were irritating consumers and have started       rolling out a software solution called Quick Chip. The new       system eliminates some things, like prompts for customers to       confirm transaction amounts, and also allows customers to       take their cards out of terminals while their transactions       are still processing. Faster transactions will probably make       everyone happier, but an        notes that QuickChip does make some  to speed processing       time.     ’ ’       The transition to chip credit cards hasn’t been easy, partly       because it is a   standards decision rather than       one by the government. In terms of    life with EMV       cards, though, things should get easier and less confusing       for customers over the months and certainly years. If only       the whole process had been as easy (and tasty) as chip and       dip sounds.     ’
