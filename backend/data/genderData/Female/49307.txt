’  ’ ’   On Long Island, Hampton Bays and Southhampton residents woke up   to a gruesome sight on Monday morning: thousands and thousands of   dead fish, all clustered and floating in the Shinnecock Canal. ’ ’   Before the canal locks were opened to let the bodies flow out,   the dead menhaden (or bunker) fish were so tightly packed that   you could barely see water in areas. ’ ”   A combination of factors most likely contributed to the massive    . Christopher Gobler, who directs the marine science   program at Stony Brook University,  that predators probably pushed a   massive school of the creatures up into the canal. Sean O’Neill,   of the nonprofit Peconic Baykeeper, told The Star that the   supermoon probably created a massive tide, contributing to a   flood of fish up the canal on Sunday night. ” ’   Then the canal locks closed. ’ ’ ’ ”   With the locks closed, the flow of water stopped. Thousands of   fish would have been trapped, consuming all the available oxygen   in the water until there wasn’t any left. With no water flow or   photosynthesis at night, none of that oxygen would have been   replenished. ” ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tThis is pretty disturbing. ..this was the Shinnecock canal this morning  ’ ”   That alone was probably enough to cause the  . Tests are   still pending, but O’Neill said there didn’t appear to be any   sort chemical problem or algal bloom, another phenomenon that can   kill off marine life. ” ’   ”I think it’’s kind of just wrong place, wrong time,” he told The   Star. ’ ’   Sounds like a nightmarish ”wrong place, wrong time” scenario. ’ ’ ) ’
