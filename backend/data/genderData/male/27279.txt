Baltimore kids who surrender toy guns receive “prizes” from “Peace Camp” volunteers. [“Peace Camp” is a project of By Peaceful Means, an organization founded a decade ago by Ralph E. Moore, Jr. and Nawal Rajeh, a former literacy camp volunteer. Rajeh “persuaded Moore to launch a summer peace camp  …    after she watched a fight break out between two   girls on a day that coincided with the anniversary of the Iraq War. ”  According to The Baltimore Sun, Moore compared taking toy guns to taking candy cigarettes by saying the candy cigarettes were “orienting kids to smoking. I think toy guns, in many ways, are doing the same thing. ” He said, “The replica guns are what’s dangerous. ” Kids who handed over their toys were given a prize and their guns placed into an art project that featured a mosaic of “a brightly colored hand flashing a peace sign, surrounded by surrendered toy guns. ” The mosaic “will be displayed in part to honor Tamir Rice, the    boy shot and killed by Cleveland police in 2014 while playing with a toy gun at a community center. ” The Sun reported that    Sebastian Taylor “surrendered his two least favorite toy guns in exchange for a ball for his older brother, Eli, and a set of   for himself. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.
