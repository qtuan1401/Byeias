Turkey is convinced Arab countries were involved in Friday night’s failed coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an Arab intelligence source told Breitbart Jerusalem. [The source said that Ankara believes the UAE and Egypt, two of the bitterest enemies of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Arab world, sought to undermine Erdogan’s regime, one of the movement’s staunchest allies and sponsors. If Gulan indeed visited the UAE, the Turks will have their smoking gun. They are also looking into the role played by Mohammed Dahlan, formerly a top Palestinian Authority official, who is currently a close adviser to Prince Muhammad Bin Zayed, the heir to the UAE throne, and their ally President Abdel Fatah Sisi of Egypt. Turkey sees Dahlan as the centerpiece of an international   Brotherhood network.
