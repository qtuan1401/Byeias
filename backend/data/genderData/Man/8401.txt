YouTube disabled Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO’s livestreaming ability on Friday, just hours before his speech on immigration at the University of New Mexico. [MILO’s ability to host livestreams was withdrawn from YouTube after his video “MILO At UC  —   Colorado Springs: Democrats Are The ‘Party Of The Cuckold,’” was flagged and subsequently removed.  Though MILO has appealed the channel restrictions, YouTube has yet to remove the livestream ban. Consequently, MILO’s speech at the University of New Mexico tonight will not be livestreamed. The speech will be posted in its entirely to MILO’s YouTube channel after the event as usual, but fans will not be able to watch it live. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
