An investigation by KHOU’s   discovered a Houston, TX high school teacher is teaching a French class without actually knowing French.  According to Energy Institute High School student Nathanial White, French teacher Albert Moyer’s only knowledge of the language is “Bonjour,” which White said, “But everybody knows that. ” Moyer reportedly said in a brief phone interview with   that his education of the language was just one year in high school. The report says Moyer is teaching French at the school after a dispute led to the dismissal of Jean Cius, a certified French teacher for over 25 years. “It makes me extremely mad,” Cius said of the situation. “I feel bad for the fact that the kids are not learning. ” School records show Cius was removed from the campus in December. He was later deemed fit for duty, but he was never given his old job back. White showed   his report card, which still lists Cius as the French teacher. When asked how he could be the teacher of record without being there, Cius responded, “That’s the question. I’d like to know the answer to those questions. ” If a student ever has a question about the language, White said they have to look it up on Google to find out the answer.   reports that after they started asking questions on campus parents received a letter from the principal telling them their child’s teacher is not highly qualified.
