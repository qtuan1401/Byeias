’   Melissa McCarthy returned to ”Saturday Night Live” as White House   Press Secretary Sean Spicer, this time dressed as the Easter   Bunny. ’ ’   Spicer really did play the furry white animal when he was a   spokesman for the US Trade Representative under President George   W. Bush in 2008: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tOn this Easter Sunday, let us all pause and remember when Sean Spicer was the White House Easter Bunny in 2008.  ’ ’ ’t’t’tthe good ole days    what I would give to hide in a bunny costume again   ’ ’   After shooing children gathering Easter eggs, McCarthy recapped    that garnered  this week, when he incorrectly said Adolf   Hitler didn’’t use chemical weapons.  for his ”inexcusable and   reprehensible” comments, but McCarthy had to bring it up. ’ ’   ”They were all like, ’’Boohoo, what about the ? ’’ And yeah, I know they’’re not really   called ’’holocaust centers. ’’ Duh! I know that. I’’m aware. I   clearly meant to say ’’concentration clubs,’’” McCarthy said. ”It   would be really great if the nitpickers could try to see the big   picture, and didn’’t focus on every single little slur and lie I   say  —   that’’d be nice! And P. S. I’’d like you also to know I am   sensitive to the fact that they were sent there on trains, but   hey, at least they didn’’t have to fly United, am I right?” ’ ’   Using ”baby dolls” as props, McCarthy then incorrectly explained   the story of the Jewish holiday of Passover. ’ ’   ”That about wraps it up for me. Happy Easter, everybody! Oh and   by the way, the president’’s probably going to bomb North Korea   tonight,” she said. ”Spicey’’s got to   and deliver   these eggs. Everybody just eat as much candy as you want, ’’cause   this is probably our last Easter on Earth.” ’ ’ ’ ’Melissa McCarthy returned to ”Saturday Night. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
