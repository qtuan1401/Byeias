Twitter is now allowing any user to apply for account verification on their platform. [Accounts who wish to request verification will have to fill out an online form and follow a series of guidelines before waiting for Twitter’s response. Failed applicants will be able to reapply every thirty days.  “We want to make it even easier for people to find creators and influencers on Twitter so it makes sense for us to let people apply for verification,” announced Twitter’s Vice President of User Services, Tina Bhatnagar. “We hope opening up this application process results in more people finding great,   accounts to follow, and for these creators and influencers to connect with a broader audience. ” Last January, Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos lost his Twitter verification badge without being given a reason, despite hundreds of parody, hoax, and fan accounts in his name currently located on the platform. The removal of Yiannopoulos’ verification badge prompted thousands of fans and free speech advocates alike to tweet with the #JeSuisMilo hashtag however, his verification badge and privileges have not been returned to this day. It is currently unknown as to whether Twitter will be confirming verification requests from anybody, or whether they will continue to follow their guidelines of verifying public figures, large companies, and the media, but if it is the former, it may be entirely possible that a Milo Yiannopoulos fan account becomes verified before Yiannopoulos himself.
