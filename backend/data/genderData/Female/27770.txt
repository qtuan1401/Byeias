Pop superstar Adele shot down rumors that she had accepted an offer to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2017 during a concert in Los Angeles over the weekend. [“First of all, I’m not doing the Super Bowl,” Adele told the sold out crowd at the Staples Center, responding to what she called “stupid rumors,” which included her being pregnant. “I mean, come on, that show is not about music. And I don’t really  …    I can’t dance or anything like that. They were very kind, they did ask me, but I did say no. ”  However, the “Hello” singer didn’t take the possibility of eventually performing at the Super Bowl completely off the table. “I’m sorry, but maybe next time,” she added.  However, wasting no time, the NFL and Pepsi, the official sponsor of the Super Bowl halftime show, released a statement denying that they ever extended a “formal” offer to Adele. “The NFL and Pepsi are big fans of Adele. We have had conversations with several artists about the Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show. However, we have not at this point extended a formal offer to Adele or anyone else,” the statement said. “We are focused on putting together a fantastic show for Houston and we look forward to revealing that in good time. ” A “formal” offer may not have been made, but it should surprise no one that Adele was the NFL and Pepsi’s top pick. Securing Adele for a Super Bowl halftime show performance would be ratings gold for the NFL. The British singer’s last album, 25, sold 2. 3 million copies in the U. S. in just three days. The    Skyfall singer recently signed a new     $90 million recording deal with Sony. With Adele apparently out, it’s back to the drawing board for the NFL and Pepsi.
