On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “O’Reilly Factor,” ABC15 Arizona anchor Christopher Sign, who broke the story about the meeting between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, stated that “The FBI there on the tarmac instructing everybody around ‘no photos, no pictures, no cell phones. ’” And that he has “no idea” why Clinton was in Phoenix to begin with.  Sign described the meeting between Lynch and Clinton, [relevant remarks begin around 1:40] “Some people step off of her plane. The former president steps into her plane. They then speak for 30 minutes privately. The FBI there on the tarmac instructing everybody around ‘no photos, no pictures, no cell phones. ’” When asked why Clinton was in Phoenix, Sign answered, “To be honest with you, we have no idea. And the attorney general, as a matter of fact, she said they talked about him playing golf. At this very moment, as I’m talking to you, I’ve reached out to several sources, those with intimate knowledge of his movements, because they work with these dignitaries when they come into Phoenix, not one so far has said that he played golf. I’m not saying that he didn’t play golf. I’m just saying I have yet to confirm that he played golf. ” (  Hot Air) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
