Popular PC gaming retail service Steam has announced plans to add around 100 rentable Hollywood movies to its service. [The move is a partnership with film company Lionsgate, whose films include The Hunger Games, Saw, and Twilight, which are now available for users to rent.  The titles are competitively priced against the likes of Amazon, at $3. 99 for a 48 hour rental, with no unique software required to play the content. On its FAQ page, Valve explains “all users” will be able to stream the films, but cautions “it is a new feature and performance issues may be experienced. ” “With over 125 million users, Steam represents a unique, exciting and disruptive opportunity to expand our global distribution business,” Lionsgate’s president of worldwide television and digital distribution Jim Packer said in a statement.
