It’s supposed to be protected and stay at a safe temperature to store all those seeds.” ’But extreme temperatures in the Arctic this winter  —   combined with heavy rain instead of snow  —   led to melting permafrost that gushed into the tunnel leading into the vault,  raising questions about whether the doomsday vault will survive a warming planet.’ ’’ ’”It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,” Hege Njaa Aschim, an official in the Norweigan government, which controls the vault, . ”A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in. ”’ ”The water didn’t travel all the way down into the vault, which is still safe, and officials could chip all the ice out the entryway.” ”Here’s what the vault looks like inside  —   and why administrators are worried about the potentially devastating effects of climate change.” ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’ ’Source: ’
