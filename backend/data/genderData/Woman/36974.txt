Washington (CNN) Members of Congress will soon receive notes from Hillary Clinton’s interview with the FBI over her private email server and they could be sent as early as Monday, according to sources.  The FBI does not have a complete transcript of the interview, FBI Director James Comey told Congress in long testimony earlier this summer. She was not under oath, he added. But members of Congress will have access to notes taken during the interview. Several Republican lawmakers have requested the information after Comey’s testimony.  Politico first reported that the Obama administration was debating how to release the documents, over concern that the records are politically sensitive.  Clinton spoke with the FBI for more than three hours during the bureau’s investigation of her use of her private email server as secretary of state.  Ultimately, Comey strongly chastised her use of the server and said she and her staff likely put sensitive information at risk. But he said there was no precedent for recommending criminal charges and the Justice Department agreed there was no criminal case to pursue.
