BEREA, Ohio (AP)  —   Quarterback Robert Griffin III is back behind center for the Browns. [Griffin will make his second start this season on Sunday against Cincinnati. He hasn’t played since the Sept. 11 opener when he broke a bone in his left shoulder late in the fourth quarter against Philadelphia.  The winless Browns placed him on injured reserve with the idea he could return, and coach Hue Jackson made the decision on Thursday to start RG3 after two days of practice. Griffin signed with the Browns as a free agent during the offseason after he was released by the Washington Redskins. Cleveland has been unable to find a franchise quarterback for more than a decade and is giving the    Griffin a chance to revive his career. After Griffin was injured the Browns also started Josh McCown and rookie Cody Kessler.
