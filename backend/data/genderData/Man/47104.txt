’There was nothing remotely luxurious about   vehicles when they first appeared in America a generation ago.’ ’They were outdoorsy machines designed for people who would break a station wagon and needed something less   than a surplus Jeep or a serious expedition vehicle from Toyota or Land Rover.    clans took to them and turned Jeep Wagoneers and Ford Broncos into icons. But in the posher suburbs, big sedans still ruled the roads  —   Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, Cadillac, and Lincoln.’ ”Then in the late ’90s, Lincoln had a brilliant insight: Let’s upscale the SUV. The Ford Expedition became the Lincoln Navigator. Cadillac turned the Chevy Suburban into the Escalade. Sales and profits followed, and soon all luxury brands needed a     SUV.”
