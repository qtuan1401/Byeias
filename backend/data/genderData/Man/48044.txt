’’ ’One of the biggest letdowns in Yahoo’’s   earnings was  short for ”mobile, video, native, and social. ”’ ’’ ’’ ’Now Yahoo says that it expects Mavens business to decline for the full year,  filed on Monday:’ ’This is a bit surprising given how Yahoo wrote in  that it expects Mavens revenue to increase in 2016. Yahoo made some changes to its accounting method in the second quarter because of its deal with Microsoft, and Mavens revenue actually grew under the new accounting method. But as Yahoo disclosed, it declined 4% based on the old accounting method.’ ’The disclosure is all the more disappointing because Mayer said in her most recent earnings call that she expected to bring Mavens back to growth over the rest of the year.’ ’”Mavens is a key part of our strategy, our growth and our turnaround story, and we will work very hard to get the Mavens collectively back to growth in the second half of the year,”  in July.’ ”Yahoo blamed the decline on pricing pressure and lower demand, as well as the uncertainty around the company’s future because of its sale to Verizon. Whatever the case is, it’s another huge blow to Mayer’s legacy as Yahoo CEO.”
