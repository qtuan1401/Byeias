A bomb attack in Giza, on a road leading to the pyramids, killed at least six people on Thursday  —   including three Egyptian police officers  —   and wounded 13 others. Two of the wounded are reportedly in critical condition. The Egyptian Interior Ministry blamed the attack on Muslim Brotherhood militants. [The UK Guardian notes the bomb went off as police were preparing to raid an apartment where Muslim Brotherhood militants were suspected of hiding.  The UK Express adds that security officers were attempting to defuse a “time bomb” during the raid, when the explosion occurred. This report adds it is not yet certain if any of the militants were injured, killed, or captured during the raid. The UK Daily Mail puts the casualty count at nine dead and 10 injured, and says the police were acting on a tip that Brotherhood members headquartered in the apartment were “preparing to carry out aggressive acts in the coming days using explosives and crude bombs. ” According to the Daily Mail, the neighborhood where the incident took place has seen several violent attacks since the Muslim Brotherhood government of President Mohamed Morsi was overthrown in 2013, and is known to house a number of Morsi sympathizers, along with sporting a number of hotels for Cairo tourists. The fifth anniversary of the revolution that deposed Morsi’s predecessor, Hosni Mubarak, is coming up this Monday. Security has been stepped up in Cairo, and across Egypt, in advance of the occasion. There has also been a crackdown against activists who might organize demonstrations for the anniversary date. On Friday, Fox News reported that an ISIS affiliate had claimed responsibility for the Giza bombing, in a statement circulated through Islamic State social media.
