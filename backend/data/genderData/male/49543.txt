The building’s developers, Millennium   Partners,  to drill holes around the building in order   to test soil samples and figure out why the tower is sinking and   what can be done to prevent it from sinking further. ” ”   The cause of the building’s problems remains cloudy.  ” ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Millennium Tower sits on land that is iquefaction, the process by which loose sand and   silt behaves like a liquid in the event of an earthquake. The   seismic activity causes water pressure in the sediment to   increase and grains of sand to lose contact with each other, the   US Geological Survey (USGS) .   The soil may give out under large and heavy structures. ’ ’  ’ ”   Millennium Tower doesn’t face a unique   problem much of San Francisco is prone   to liquefying. A   map from the USGS   highlights   areas in red and   areas in   yellow. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   Patrick Shires, who owns an engineering company outside San Jose   and has worked in the field for 40 years, warned the building’s   residents in May that their problems are still far from over. ” ’   Shires said Millennium Tower will ”most likely” sink an   additional eight to 15 inches in the coming years, according to   The Chronicle. The building could dip 31 inches total. ’ ”   The building’s developers  that the building remains structurally sound. ”
