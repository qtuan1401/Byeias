Wednesday in New York City, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton announced she would create the “Office of Immigrant Affairs” during an announcement that she was accepting the endorsement of New York State Immigrant Action Fund, an immigrant right group.  “I would create the first ever Office of Immigrant Affairs,” Clinton said. “It would build on the work of the Obama administration’s task force. ” That task force she referred to was President Barack Obama’s White House Task Force on New Americans, which was established in 2014 as a result of his executive amnesty order and has been behind efforts to naturalize immigrants in mass numbers over the past year.
