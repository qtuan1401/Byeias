’’ ’Tesla shares are down 9% to $160, as we head into the end of the trading session on Friday.’ ”That’s the lowest point the stock has hit in a year.” ’The   maker reports   and   2015 earnings next week.’ ’Ahead of that, several analysts have reduced their target prices on the stock,  who dropped his price target from a bullish $450 to a still fairly bullish $333.’ ’Tesla shares have been sliding since the beginning of the year, after closing out 2015 at $240, a plunge that might be chalked up to skepticism among investors that Tesla will be able to rapidly ramp up production and deliveries of its new Model X SUV.’ ”Jonas also expressed doubt that Tesla’s next vehicle, the Model 3   sedan  —   expected price: $35, 000  —   will make it to market on schedule in 2017.
