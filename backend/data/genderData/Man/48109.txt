’’ ’Apple CEO Tim Cook gave his clearest indication yet that the company is working on what many view as the next major computing platform.’ ’In an  published Sunday, Cook said Apple is ”doing a lot of things” with augmented reality (AR) the technology that puts digital images on top of the real world.’ ”Here’s the full quote:” ”The most popular example of AR today is the smash hit Pokémon Go, which lets you catch virtual monsters in the real world. But there are more extreme examples, like Microsoft’s HoloLens headset and the startup Magic Leap’s   cinematic reality that’s being developed now. Magic Leap thinks AR headsets could one day replace many of the screens in your life by projecting whatever it is you need in front of your eyes.” ”Although this isn’t the first time Cook has admitted Apple is interested in AR  —   he’s spoken about it in broad terms before on recent earnings calls  —   this is the first time he’s explicitly said the company is working on the technology. ”
