Wednesday on CNN, network political director David Chalian discussed the potential controversy over Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and his eligibility to be president of the United States.  Chalian said that although Cruz would probably be shown to be eligible if it were ever tested in court, it isn’t proven law. “[N]ow where he was wrong in his comments, is when he says that it is settled law,” Chalian said. “It’s not actually settled law. The preponderance of legal analysts have looked at this and said, ‘Hey, if this gets tested in court, Ted Cruz would be likely to win this.’ I mean, they think it’s how it will be interpreted, that he is a   citizen. But it isn’t settled law yet because it hasn’t actually been tested. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
