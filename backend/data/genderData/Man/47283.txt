’  ’ ”     If you think Detroit’s population decline has been   city     had 1. 85 million residents in 1950 and just 710, 000 in       the total disintegration of its transit network.   ” ’     At the end of World War II, Motown and its environs were home     to the largest municipally owned streetcar system in the United     States.   ’ ’     Regional streetcars, buses, and commuter rail .   ’ ’     Today, the streetcars and commuter rail are gone. Until a new     streetcar line opens next year, Detroit will be the largest     American metropolis without surface rail transit.   ’ ’     The annual ridership on urban and suburban transit is now 36     million, a decline of more than 90 percent from its 1940s peak.     The entire city of Detroit has lower weekday bus ridership than     the two busiest individual New York City bus routes.   ’ ”     It’s not for lack of need that the region doesn’t support     transit: Despite its autocentric reputation, Detroit is      nationally in its     percentage of carless   the nation’s transit     capitals of New York; Washington, D. C.; Boston; San Francisco;     Chicago; and Philadelphia; as well as Baltimore. The region     spends $69 per capita on transit each year; for comparison,     Atlanta spends $119 per capita, Cleveland $177, and Seattle     $471.   ” ”     The Detroit area’s shambolic system is a burden on residents     who can’t or don’t drive. Last year, a Detroit factory worker     named James Robertson became a local celebrity after the     Detroit Free Press wrote about .   ” ’     They called him the ”Walking Man.” A local car dealer gave     Robertson a   Ford Taurus, and now he drives to work.     The remaining 66, 000 households that make up Detroit’’s carless     population aren’’t so lucky. For them, no bus means no way to     get to work, or anywhere else. Poor transit access is linked to     unemployment, low income, and low economic mobility.   ’ ”     But America’s worst transit system could be getting better     soon. Last week, the Southeast Michigan Regional Transit     Authority, or RTA,      to knit Detroit, its suburbs, the Wayne County Airport, and the     nearby college towns of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti into one     comprehensive network.   ” ’     The Regional Master Transit Plan, or RMTP, would bring     integrated transit to the Detroit region for the first time in     more than 50 years and solve longstanding problems of transit     funding and governance through a mandatory transit millage, or     property tax increase, of $120 on every $100, 000 of assessed     value.   ’ ’     Following a public review period this month and RTA board     approval in July, the proposal will face an    vote on     the ballot this November across four counties of southeast     Michigan.   ’ ’  ’ ’     If it passes, the plan would double per capita transit funding     in the   represent a rare instance of cooperation in     the vitriolic political history of mostly black Detroit and its     largely white suburbs. Its approval would signify popular     recognition that Detroit and its surrounding counties share a     common interest. And it would make it a whole lot easier to get     around without a car.   ’ ’     The status quo, in contrast, is encapsulated by the infamous     pronouncement that L. Brooks Patterson, the executive of     wealthy Oakland County to the north of Detroit,  in 2014: ”I made a prediction a long     time ago, and it’’s come to pass. I said ’’What we’’re going to do     is turn Detroit into an Indian reservation, where we herd all     the Indians into the city, build a fence around it, and then     throw in the blankets and corn. ’’ ” ’ ”     For Detroit bus riders, 8 Mile Road might as well be that     fence. Detroit routes, shown in green on the map below, stop     abruptly at the city limits; the buses that roll through the     streets of the wealthy northern suburbs don’t generally cross 8     Mile Road. Those that do make the trip to downtown Detroit are          in the morning or dropping them off in the evening. (And few of     the urban or suburban buses come more than once every       even during the morning rush.)   ” ”     Such parochialism wouldn’t make sense anywhere in America, but     it’s particularly inane in Detroit. Three in 5 Detroiters work     outside the city, and nearly   of the people who     work inside Detroit live in the suburbs. According to the     Brookings Institution, only five U. S.   Sun Belt     boomtowns of Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, and        than Detroit’s 10. 4 miles. The economies of city     and suburb have always been interdependent, even as their     transit systems have remained stubbornly apart.     ” ’     The RTA plan would fix that. It proposes bus rapid transit, or     BRT, corridors on Detroit’’s wide, radiating avenues that would     take passengers from downtown Detroit to Mt. Clemens, Pontiac,     Dearborn, and the airport. It would reopen a       commuter rail link between Ann Arbor, home of the University of     Michigan, and Detroit. And it would extend a grid of 11     ”  connectors” (  local buses,     essentially) across the region.   ’ ’     ”There’’s a growing realization in the city and the suburbs that     we’’re really one economy,” argues Sandy Baruah, CEO of the     Detroit Regional Chamber, an economic development organization     that has been closely involved in the RTA plan. ”What happens     in the suburbs is what happens to the city and vice versa. The     economic crisis really showed that no place is an island. We’’re     going to thrive together, or we’’re going to sink together.”   ’ ’     That has not, historically, been the consensus in the Detroit     area. And the transit networks have reflected it.   ’ ’     The fragmentation of transit began in 1956, when the last     streetcars were replaced by buses that wound up under the     dueling authority of the Detroit Department of Transportation     and the suburban agency, now called SMART. Neither body had the     funding to maintain   service levels. In the suburbs,     public support dwindled amid racial tensions over busing and     school integration.   ’ ’     At planning meetings, white suburbanites  against transit,     which they feared would bring in ”undesirables, transit crime     and   housing,” the Detroit News reported.     And the city, under Mayor Coleman Young’’s   tenure     from 1974 to 1994, didn’’t want to surrender control to an     agency dominated by suburban politicians.   ’ ’     The economies of Detroit and its suburbs have always been     interdependent, even as their transit systems have remained     stubbornly apart.   ’ ”     The transit history of the region is cluttered with remedial     acronyms: 1969’s Detroit Regional Transportation and Land Use     Study; or TALUS, 1984’s Regional Public Transportation     Consensus Plan, or RPTCP; 1989’s Regional Transit Coordinating     Council, or RTCC; 2001’s Detroit Area Regional Transportation     Authority, or DARTA. The best that more than a dozen attempts     could do for the region was create a   bus pass.   ” ”     Their failures are more remarkable. In the 1970s, southeast     Michigan  President Gerald     Ford’s promise of hundreds of millions in federal dollars for     regional transit because leaders couldn’t compromise on how the     money should be spent.   ” ’  ’ ”     The RTA, created by Gov. Rick Snyder in 2012, might actually     make a difference. Unlike its  ’00s predecessor DARTA, it     has the power to levy taxes throughout the   region.     If its transit plan passes this   voter turnout in     these blue counties will be   will collect a transit     millage from a big swath of the state. And unlike the suburban     SMART, it won’t allow   municipalities to opt out of     the service   feature that has drained support from     regional bus operations and produced a transit coverage map     that  like Swiss cheese.   ” ”     Does the Regional Transit Master Plan stand a chance with     voters? It’s only been a week since the draft plan was released     in full, but some of the ideas have been discussed for years,     and many supporters feel optimistic. The fracture between     Detroit and its suburbs is   in some ways, not as deep     as it has been before.   ” ’     The share of Detroiters living in predominantly white suburbs,     for example,  from 65 percent in 2000     to 49 percent in 2010. Transit millage for SMART bus service is     consistently, resoundingly renewed by suburban voters (in     communities that have opted into the SMART service area). And     Detroit, riding a wave of good press and downtown growth, is     seen as more of a regional asset than it used to be.   ’ ’     ”The fundamental difference between now and even five years ago     is that Detroit is rapidly becoming a city that the region can     be and is proud of,” says Baruah. ”That’’s really changing the     dynamic. The resurgence, the businesses moving in, the good       those good feelings about the city they grew up     in, feelings that may have gone away 20 years ago, are starting     to come back.”   ’ ”     Detroit, where more than a quarter of households don’t have a     car, will likely vote in favor. The college towns of Ann Arbor     and Ypsilanti, where many voters don’t own property, have been     promised quick, cheap, carless access to downtown, which may be     enough of an enticement to win widespread support for the RTMP.     Transit to the airport, in the form of five hourly airport     express buses, is a carrot for wealthier voters.   ” ”     Still, the result will come down to suburbanites. Their     politicians haven’t exactly been enthusiastic. Macomb County     executive Mark Hackel has very cautiously expressed support for     the plan but voiced concerns about the tax burden. Patterson,     the Oakland County executive, supported the creation of the RTA     in 2012 but hasn’t taken a position on the referendum.   ” ”     Gerald Poisson, a deputy of Patterson’s,  in an interview     with Bridge magazine earlier this year that a millage     of 1. 1 would bring in just $7. 7 million from   $57     million from Oakland County, whose population is not even twice     that of Detroit. (The actual RTMP millage is 1. 2.)   ” ’  ’ ’     To some extent, the routes are   to draw out     voters in the suburbs, explains Tiffany Gunter, the Deputy CEO     of the RTA. Good transit follows residential density, so the     benefits of the plan should be close at hand in the more highly     populated areas of the region.    ’ ’     In this case, transit also follows money. The Michigan     legislature gave the RTA an ”85 percent” rule that requires     most money to be spent in the county where it’’s collected. As a     result, the network must, by law, replicate in its service     provision some of the disparities that exist between urban and     suburban wealth in the region.   ’ ”     Nevertheless, it will constitute in a small way the kind of        wealth transfer that residents of the Detroit     suburbs have long found undesirable. It also affirms downtown     Detroit’s regional prominence, though no metro area in the U. S.     has a  of the central business district.   ” ’     Joel Batterman, the coordinator of the  an organization     that advocates for better transit in the region, believes that       politicians are a step behind. ”Shutting people     out of opportunity and trashing the central city is ultimately     suicidal for everyone in the region, even the affluent     suburbs,” he says.   ’ ’     ”Some inner suburban leaders are recognizing that transit is     critical for their communities to prosper. I’’m afraid that     hasn’’t filtered up to   leadership, but even there     we see some beginnings of change.” Corporate support for     transit, from the area’’s big foundations as well as business     organizations like the Detroit Regional Chamber, has been     strong.   ’ ’     Finally, the RTA plan represents something new after decades of     failed proposals: a plebiscite. Transit boosters are quick to     point out that both the Detroit Zoo and the Detroit Institute     of the Arts derive funding from regional millage votes. Why not     transit? ”There have been dozens of efforts to improve transit,     but the region has never voted,” notes Megan Owens, the     executive director of  a local advocacy group. Politicians, not people,     have failed to build a regional consensus. ”There has never     been a vote across the   area to ask: Do you want to     improve transit?”   ’ ”     Until November, that is, when buses, trains, and property taxes     go on the ballot. The plan’s passage would break down some     symbolic barriers, and some practical ones as well.   ” ” *Correction, June 7, 2016: This article     originally misquoted Oakland County Executive L.
