  San Francisco far and away leads the nation in the list of cities with surging rates of property crime. [San Francisco’s rate of property crime incidents per 100, 000 residents is more than four times that of the number two city: Long Beach, California.  According to CALmatters, FBI Preliminary Semiannual Uniform Crime Reports show that the property crime rate in San Francisco surged to 667 per 100, 000 residents in the first half of 2015. Long Beach was 147 per 100, 000 Los Angeles was 145 per 100, 000 and Albuquerque was 142 per 100, 000. The rest of the top ten included Sacramento (86 per 100, 000) San Jose (66 per 100, 000) Baltimore (31 per 100, 000) Nashville (11 per 100, 000) San Diego (1 per 100, 000) and Jacksonville (  per 100, 000). Calmatters points out that even though five of the ten cities for property crime are in California, Governor Jerry Brown (D) is “collecting signatures to qualify a measure for the November ballot that would further reduce the prison population by allowing more nonviolent inmates to gain earlier access to parole. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
