Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Democratic strategist and former DNC Chair Donna Brazile at Saturday’s ABC News Republican primary debate Gov. Chris Christie ( ) “prosecuted” Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) referencing Christie’s years as the United States Attorney for New Jersey.  Brazile said, “Right, right. Well, look, Marco Rubio was supposed to be the rock star. He was supposed to be the guy who comes out and with his charisma to transcend all of this, what I call, messiness of the Republican Party. He came out last night, George, with a prerecorded stump speech in his head and he couldn’t hit pause to respond to Chris Christie. Chris Christie prosecuted Marco Rubio. And he kept coming back with his stump speech. And his stump speech was, unlike Obama, and then he stalled. And so I think it was a bad night for him. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
