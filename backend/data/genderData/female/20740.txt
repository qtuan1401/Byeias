Actress and comedian Tina Fey complained about the abundance of liberal political agendas at the Academy Awards during an interview with Howard Stern this week. [The Whiskey Tango Foxtrot star stopped by Stern’s SiriusXM radio show on Thursday as part of a press tour to promote the film. When asked about being away from her home in New York to attend the Oscars in Los Angeles last Sunday, she complained of the plentitude of liberal political causes in Hollywood.  “I will say, being at the Oscars  —   and I don’t know if you guys feel this way when you go out there, but  —   I’m so glad I live here,” Fey said, adding, “because half way through I was like, ‘This is some real Hollywood bulls —  t. ’” “Everyone’s telling me, like, what to do and people are yelling at me about rape and corporate greed, but really it’s climate change,” the actress said of the politically and racially charged ceremony. “It’s like guys, pick a lane. Like, everyone, we’re going to fix everything tonight.’ And also, like, ‘you’re all rich. Why are you yelling at me about corporate greed? You’re all so rich. ’” Stern then pressed Fey on whether she is “turned off when Leonardo DiCaprio starts using the podium to talk about climate change?” “I mean, no.   …     I always am psyched when someone is articulate at those things because, let’s face it, actors are very stupid,” Fey responded. The actress then complimented DiCaprio’s speech as “cogent. ” Stern also asked Fey if DiCaprio’s environmental activism gives him a free pass to sleep with an abundance of women in a “misogynistic” way. “Isn’t it misogynistic when you know you’re a man of power and you know that these girls are looking for something to use you for, they want the power, and you use them for their beauty?” said Stern. “I don’t think it’s misogynistic,” Fey responded. “I think that everybody there is up for it. ” Listen to the segment below: *Language Warning*
