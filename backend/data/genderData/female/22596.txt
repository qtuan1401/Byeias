Police arrested two teenage girls accused of attacking a    man in an encounter that was caught on video and shared with police.[   The man, who was attacked in front of his Syracuse, New York, home, told police he was assaulted after he asked a group of teens on his lawn to leave, WXIN reported. It is unclear what happened before the video was shot, but cell phone video footage showed one of the girls punching the man in the head twice. He tried to run after her, when the second girl spun him around while several other teens laughed, one of them recording the incident with his phone. The man continued to chase the two girls as they ran away, but he tripped and fell on his face in the street, and his cane slid away from him. The two girls, aged 14 and 15, face   assault charges, WXIN reported. Both girls, who are not named because they are minors, received appearance tickets and left with their parents after their arrest. WXIN reported that the mother of one of the girls wants her to apologize to the man, saying what she did was inexcusable. She said her daughter will accept full responsibility for her actions. The man is recovering from a bruised eye he suffered during the attack. The video has been viewed more than a million times, its reach going so wide across the Internet that the victimâ€™s relatives from Ireland contacted him to say they saw the video.
