StubHub becomes the first company to emblazon its name on a NBA team jersey now that the Philadelphia 76ers and the online ticket company agreed to their sponsorship. [The Sixers will start wearing the new StubHub logo starting in the   season, according to NBA. com. This marks the first time in the history of major sports leagues in America that team jerseys will advertise a corporate sponsor.   Breitbart News reported last month that Commissioner Adam Silver cited “manifest destiny,” as the reason for further commercialization of the NBA uniforms. The sponsorship of jersey logos, according to ESPN sources, could bring an additional $180 million per year in new revenue for the league. “This marks another groundbreaking first for the Philadelphia 76ers and StubHub.  Our brands are now inextricably linked as we create lifelong memories for our fans in Philadelphia and around the world,” 76ers CEO Scott O’Neil maintains.  “Our partnership with StubHub continues to generate progressive and   platforms created to improve the fan experience and advance our industry.  The essence of our relationship with StubHub is our shared culture and ambition to innovate, which drives us to reimagine traditional partnership activation and continually ask, ‘what if’?” StubHub CEO Scott Cutler acknowledged that they are “very transaction oriented” and that the 76ers jersey “is strategic beachhead property for us. ” He believes the alliance will create an enhanced intimacy between the company and its fans.
