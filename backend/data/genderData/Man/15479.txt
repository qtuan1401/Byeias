Thursday while campaigning for his wife Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia, former president Bill Clinton had to repeatedly address protesters angry with the results of the crime and welfare bills passed during his presidency.  Clinton addressed the protesters saying, “Whoa, whoa, whoa. wait, wait. I want to be able to  —   come on. no. come on. wait, wait, wait. wait. You need to understand, this is what’s the matter. I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got    kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other   children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn’t. She didn’t. You are defending the people who killed the lives, who say matter. Tell the truth. You are defending the people who caused young people to take guns. There was a    girl in Washington, D. C. How would you do it? Look at these other ones. Look at this. That’s not true. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
