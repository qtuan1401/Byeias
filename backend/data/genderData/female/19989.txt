Former President Bill Clinton said that Republicans are “kind of scary” during a campaign stop Monday for his wife Hillary’s presidential effort. [Clinton appeared in New Hampshire Monday to hammer GOP candidates in the slow, digressive,   rhetorical style that has marked most of his recent speeches.  “People run and, it’s kind of scary this year, but believe it or not, almost everybody tries to do what they say they’re going to do when they’re running,” Clinton said, referring to Republicans. Clinton was obviously not referring to himself or his 1992 campaign promise to pass a   tax cut, which he never did. Clinton was also asked by a reporter in New Hampshire if his “past” sexual harassment of women was fair game. Clinton replied that it’s “up to Republicans” to decide.  OO. ready( function()  ) })
