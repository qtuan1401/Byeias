A game satirizing the Black Lives Matter movement has been removed from the Google Play store for violating the store’s “hate speech” policy, the developers behind the game have revealed.

As Raj Patel, a developer at Limited Software, points out, the app does not violate this policy as Black Lives Matter is not a race but an organisation. Patel adds that he took cautionary steps to ensure the app’s suitability such as making the majority of the enemies in the game white, as well as giving it an 18+ rating. Talking to Breitbart Tech, Patel claimed that the decision was “absolutely politically motivated,” especially because “Google has expressed public support for Black Lives Matter on multiple occasions. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
