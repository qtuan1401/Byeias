On Friday, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination appeared in Vatican City and praised Pope Francis for his views on economics.  Sanders told a press gathering he supported the Pontiff’s efforts to create “a new world economy. ” “I have been enormously impressed by Pope Francis speaking out and his visionary views about creating a moral economy  —   an economy that works for all people, not just people on top,” Sanders said. “And what he has said over and over again  —   we cannot allow the market just to do what the market does. That is unacceptable. We have got to ingrain moral principles into our economy. ” “I believe the Pope has played an historical and incredible role in trying to create a new world economy and a new vision for the people of our planet,” he added.
