In reaction to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro’s death, MSNBC’s Brian Williams said the Cuban people would rather use donkey carts as transportation than the American cars from the 1950s that are still in use.  “It’s still one of those nations where you see donkey carts alongside cars, trucks and buses in downtown Havana because that’s exactly what they’d rather have for transportation,” Williams stated Saturday.
