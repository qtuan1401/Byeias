[Police also arrested 454 people during the night, 301 of whom were taken into custody.

The practice is thought to have begun in the 1990s in Strasbourg’s deprived,   districts, which quickly spread to other poor areas. According to the French interior ministry, a total of 945 cars were either “totally destroyed” or “more lightly affected” by the attacks, amounting to a 17 per cent rise on last year.
