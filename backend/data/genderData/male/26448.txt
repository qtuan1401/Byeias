Wednesday on CNN’s “The Lead,” former presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul ( ) pointed out that the rules of the Republican convention this July “haven’t been written yet. ”  Paul said, “It kinda reminds me of when I play golf. I usually like to say we’ll decide what the bet is after we decide what the scores are. When you say we’re going to adhere to the rules, you realize the rules haven’t been written yet. So what is extraordinary, and it is extraordinary, that people by the millions will have voted in a primary and then 110 people will decide how we’re going to make the rules. You can’t say we’re going to obey the rules. The rules have yet to be written. The convention will abide by rules that are written in the first day or two by 110 people. So you could write that a plurality wins or you could write that a majority wins. ” He continued, “It’s extraordinary that the rules are written after you have already had the election. It will come down to what the rules are. It is pretty extraordinary. I don’t know what the outcome will be, but it’s very exciting to see what happens on that rules committee. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
