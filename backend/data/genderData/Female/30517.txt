JANESVILLE, WI  —   New campaign signs are trolling Paul Ryan throughout his district. [Signs that resemble the lettering and coloring of Paul Ryan’s official campaign signs have popped up throughout the district, which purport to support Ryan for Congress in light of his globalist worldview.

Paul Ryan’s in for Paul Ryan. ” Nehlen added, “Can you name the last time Paul Ryan worked as hard for Wisconsin workers as he has for corporate America? I can’t. I can’t think of one time. ”
