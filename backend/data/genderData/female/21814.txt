[In photos posted to her Twitter account Wednesday morning, the    “Vogue” hitmaker shed her clothes to endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  Im voting naked with Katy Perry!!

She’s the Best we got!” Madonna captioned her partially nude shot. A few hours earlier, the singer posted a photo of herself posing with Clinton, captioning the snap: “Living with Hillary! Yes I vote for intelligence. I vote for equal rights for women and all minorities. ” Living For Hilary! Yes I vote for intelligence. I vote for equal rights for women and all minorities. 🙏🏻😂🇺🇸🎈🙌🏻 pic. twitter.   —   Madonna (@Madonna) September 28, 2016,  Madonna’s political statement came one day after her fellow pop star Katy Perry stripped down to get out the vote in a Funny or Die PSA released on National Voter Registration Day. In the   clip, Perry advises Americans that it is Constitutionally permissible to “look like sh*t” while voting on Election Day, before she sheds her clothes at a polling place and jokingly gets arrested and hauled off to jail.  Madonna has been relatively quiet about this year’s presidential race, though the singer was a staunch supporter of President Obama’s 2012 White House run. This is also not the first time that Madonna has shed her clothes for politics. In May, the singer wore a   outfit to the Met Ball Gala in order to make a   “political statement” about women’s rights. “The fact that people actually believe a woman is not allowed to express her sexuality and be adventurous past a certain age is proof that we still live in an   and sexist society,” she wrote on her Instagram account that month. Of course, Madonna’s support for Clinton may be influenced by family bias the Washington Post reported in 2007 that Clinton and Madonna are 10th cousins who share the same          grandfather. Clinton commented on the family connection in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres a few years ago.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
