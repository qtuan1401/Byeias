One of the dangerous and false narratives pushed by both Democrat politicians like President Barack Obama and their allies in the mainstream media is that the Black Lives Matter movement has nothing to do with the spate of violence against police, with eight officers killed between Dallas and Baton Rouge. [They have been able to perpetrate this myth in part because Black Lives Matter is largely a “leaderless movement,” much like radical leftist groups Occupy Wall Street and the Earth Liberation Front or the newest generation of Islamist terrorism from groups like the Islamic State. These new leaderless groups promote an ideology of violence that inspires   “lone wolf” terrorism, unlike the   control of   terrorism that we saw in the   attack on America on  . This allows the groups themselves to simultaneously take credit for an attack or distance themselves from it, as the media narrative requires.  The similarity between all these groups is that they clearly are pushing an ideology that promotes violence. While the mainstream media and Democrat narrative is that the shootings are by fringe people not connected to the movement, as Breitbart News has written repeatedly the very founders of Black Lives Matter pay homage to a convicted cop killer who is currently living in exile in Cuba and wanted by the FBI: the   Queen of the Black Liberation Army” JoAnn Chesimard, a. k. a. Assata Shakur. The BLA itself was responsible for at least 13 police murders in the 1970s. After her conviction, Shakur escaped prison when other Black Liberation Army members visiting her pulled a gun and took guards hostage. Shakur lived on the lam for several years, as her associates refused to cooperate with authorities, until fleeing to Cuba in 1984. Shakur has also been lionized by ’60s radicals like the Weather Underground’s Kathy Boudin, who Breitbart News reported had named her son Chesa after Shakur’s real name, JoAnne Chesimard. Again, these are not fringe players who idolize Assata but the women who founded the movement. Last year, Essence    Vanessa De Luca interviewed Black Lives Matter   Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, who described their respect for the convicted criminal communist. Cullors said that an Assata Shakur quote, which the group recites at all its events, is perfect to symbolize that the #BlackLivesMatter should matter to everyone, regardless of race. Starting in a whisper, and ending in a shout, the nearly 2, 000 attendees spoke as one. It is our duty to fight for our freedom It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains. The lines come from a letter that Shakur wrote titled “To My People,” where she describes herself as a “Black revolutionary” who “declared war on the rich who prosper on our poverty, the politicians who lie to us with smiling faces, and all the mindless,   robots who protect them and their property. ” Now it seems that people are doing their “duty” and killing cops. Here’s a rogue’s gallery of other convicted cop killers that are heroes to the movement. Is it surprising that a group like Black Lives Matter who idolizes cop killers would end up inspiring cop killers?
