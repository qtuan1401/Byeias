 (CNN) USA Network has once again delayed the premiere of an upcoming drama about a decorated Marine sniper in the wake of the latest deadly shooting of police officers.  ”Shooter,” based on the 2007 film starring Mark Wahlberg, had been set to debut July 19, but was delayed a week after five officers were killed by a sniper in Dallas. The network has now removed it from the summer schedule entirely, following the shooting deaths of three officers in Baton Rouge.  ”After further consideration, USA Network, Paramount TV and Universal Cable Productions have decided to move the premiere of ’Shooter’ to the fall,” NBCUniversal said in a statement.  No specific premiere date was given.  The thriller, announced back in February, centers around a veteran who comes out of retirement to help prevent the assassination of the president but ends up wrongly accused of a crime. Ryan Phillipe stars in the series, inspired by novels written by Stephen Hunter.  Wahlberg is an executive producer on the show, along with Stephen Levinson (Ballers) and Lorenzo di Bonaventura (Transformers).  On Sunday, a lone gunman’s killing of three officers in Baton Rouge became the second targeted attack on law enforcement in so many weeks. The first shooting, carried out by an Army reservist, took place during what had been a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Texas.    A version of this article was first published last week. It has been updated following the network’s decision to delay the show until fall.
