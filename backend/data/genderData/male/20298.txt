Two Muslim students have been jailed for life after plotting to kill police, soldiers and civilians in a series of   shootings inspired by Islamic State. [Tarik Hassane, 22, was sentenced to a minimum of 21 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to murder and preparation of acts of terrorism.  Suhaib Majeed, 22, was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years for the same charges. Two other men  —   Nyall Hamlett, 25, and Nathan Cuffy, 26  —   have also been imprisoned for firearms offences after admitting supplying the gun, although they deny knowing what it would be used for. They were acquitted of being part of the plot. Sentencing Hassane and Majeed at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Wilkie said: “It is shocking, tragic and deplorable that you, two young British men, educated through the UK school system, undertaking university courses, should be so influenced by the bloodthirsty version of Islam presented by ISIS and other similarly minded groups, that you decided to take up arms against your fellow British citizens and those charged with protecting them in the streets of your own city. ” The judge also said that Hassane had admitted visiting Syria in 2013 where he learned to handle firearms, and spent time with a terrorist who was later killed. After returning to Britain, he then raised thousands of pounds to support Islamist groups in Syria before becoming the “prime mover” in the   plot.
