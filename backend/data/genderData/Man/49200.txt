’  ’ ”   In just eight minutes, it’s been said to reduce study   participant’s overall anxiety by 65% and their usual   physiological resting rates by 35% . ” ’   Of the 15 songs tested by market research firm Mindlab   International, ”Weightless” was found to induce the greatest   relaxation in study participants, . Other songs the researchers   tested were chosen by surveying people about the music they found   relaxing and included tracks from artists like Enya, Coldplay,   Adele, and Mozart. ’ ”   It’s not entirely surprising that the song was found to be so   relaxing  —   it was  for a spa with the help of therapeutic sound   therapist and Founder of the British Academy of Sound Therapy,   Lyz Cooper. ” ’   ”The sound works from the point of view of sustained tones, which   really help a person feel safe,” . ’ ’   The tempo starts at 60 beats per minute and gradually decreases   to 50 beats per minute. ’ ’    ’ ’While listening, your heart rate gradually comes to   match that beat,” . ’ ”   Marconi Union’s ambient tune, which combines piano and guitars   with atmospheric and synthetic sounds, is eight minutes long,    because it takes about five minutes for your   body to synchronize with a rhythm, a process known as   entrainment. ” ”   The song was also designed not to have a repeating melody so that   the brain does not try to predict what will come next, which is   said to help induce a deeper sense of relaxation. It’s apparently   so effective that people are advised against listening to it   while they drive. ” ’   Instead, Cooper says, ”’’Weightless’’ is ideal for putting on at   the end of a stressful day and unwinding.” ’ ’     ’
