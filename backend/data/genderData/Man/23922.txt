    hotel accommodation provided for asylum seekers has been labelled discriminatory because paying guests receive better food than migrants who demand their “VIP status” be recognised. [Private contractor Clearsprings is housing 129 refugees at the   Europa Gatwick Hotel where migrants have their own rooms, with   bathrooms, plus a television and tea and   facilities.  The man, who has previously worked at hotels in Dubai, said: “We should be considered VIPs because we are   guests. We are making money for this hotel. ” One migrant interviewed last November lamented he was unable to turn back and go home, and complained about the Europeans he had met. He said: “Here it is so cold and nobody cares about us. Now we want to go, to move, there is no way back. We have already crossed seven or eight borders”. Another migrant thought Europe already had welcomed too many migrants. He said: “the weather is so cold, and the people are too much. Too much people coming to this area” .
