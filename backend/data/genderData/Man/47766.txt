”     It’s hard to know where to begin with this, a post about     Speaker Paul Ryan putting up a selfie featuring what can be     described only as a large quantity of overwhelmingly white     Capitol Hill interns, but begin we must.   ” ’     First, the selfie itself( ie):   ’ ’ ’ ’     The caption reads: ” ’ ’     On the one hand, he is not wrong. That probably does set a     record for the most number of Capitol Hill (or #CapitolHill)     interns in a single selfie.   ’ ’       On the other hand, the vast majority if not all of those       interns are white. There are many reasons that internships in       general and Hill internships in particular lack  —   and       perpetuate lack of  —   racial diversity, and some of them        a reality upon which the viewer       of this selfie is almost invited to reflect.     ’ ’       Also this photo was posted 19 hours ago, which means it was       uploaded on a Saturday.     ’
