’  ’ ’   WASHINGTON (Reuters)   A U. S. Navy destroyer was targeted on   Saturday in a failed missile attack from territory in Yemen   controlled by   Houthi rebels, the third such incident   in the past week, a U. S. defense official said. ’ ’   Multiple missiles were fired at the USS Mason sailing in   international waters in the Red Sea but the warship took   countermeasures to defend itself and was not hit, the official   said, citing initial information. ’ ’   The latest attack could provoke further retaliation by the U. S.   military, which launched cruise missiles on Thursday against   three coastal radar sites in   areas in Yemen in   response to the two previous failed missile firings against the   Mason.  ’ ”   The U. S. missile strikes, authorized by President Barack Obama,   marked Washington’s first direct military action against   suspected   targets in Yemen’s conflict and   raised questions about the potential for further   escalation.  ” ’   The Houthi movement earlier this week denied responsibility for   the missile attacks on the Mason and warned that it too would   defend itself. ’ ’’ ’   The Pentagon on Thursday stressed the limited nature of the   strikes, aimed at radar that it suspected enabled the launch of   at least three missiles against the Mason on Sunday and   Wednesday. ’ ”   Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said at the time that the U. S.     were not connected to the broader civil war in   Yemen, which has unleashed famine and killed more than 10, 000   people since March 2015 in the Arab world’s poorest country. ” ’   The United States, a longtime ally of Saudi Arabia, has provided   aerial refueling of warplanes from a   coalition striking   Yemen and it supplies U. S. weapons to the kingdom. ’ ’   Iran, which supports the Houthi group, said last week it had   deployed two warships to the Gulf of Aden, to protect ship lanes   from piracy. ’ ’   (Reporting By Idrees Ali and Matt Spetalnick; editing by Diane   Craft) ’
