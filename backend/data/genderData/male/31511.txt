Tim Ryan ( ) said he is challenging Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) for the Democratic House leadership post because, “We got shellacked Tuesday. ”  Ryan said, “We are not wining and it’s time for a change. I mean we got shellacked Tuesday. ” Ryan said the Democrats lost 68 seats since 2010, and added, “We have the smallest majority since 1929 in our caucus.
