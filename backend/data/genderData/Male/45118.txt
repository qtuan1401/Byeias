’  ’ ”   LONDON  —   It is a hung parliament. In one of the most remarkable   election results Britain has ever seen, Prime Minister Theresa   May’s Conservative party only managed to win 318 seats, eight   seats short of a majority. ” ”   Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party gained 29 seats having initially   been as far as 20% behind the Conservatives in opinion polls   conducted just weeks before Thursday night’s election. ” ’   May has refused to resign as prime minister. She delivered a   defiant speech outside 10 Downing Street earlier today, saying   her   minority government will deliver a period of   ”stability” for Britain ahead of Brexit talks.  ’ ’   The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) a Northern Irish party with   10 seats in Westminster, is set to back the Conservatives in an   informal relationship  —   but not a formal coalition   government.  ’ ’   Scroll down for the latest developments as Britain comes to terms   with a huge political shock. ’ ” 22:29  —   SATURDAY’S FRONT PAGES ” ”   Saturday’s newspaper front pages are brutal.

You can read his article    ’ ”   With the fact May led the Conservatives into an electoral   massacre when they had an operating majority government that   could’ve enjoyed power for three more years, it’s highly likely   she’ll be forced out if she doesn’t resign. ” ’ 16:00  —   THE POUND IS STILL DOWN ’ ’  ’ ’ 15:25  —   YOUTH TURNOUT SURPASSED ALL EXPECTATIONS ’ ”   We don’t have an official figure on what the   turnout was in   yesterday’s election, but the National Union of Students (NUS)   has suggested it was around 72%.
