The Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence tells Glamour Magazine in a new interview that she was horrified about the shooting by a deranged man at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood that left three people dead  —   which she called an “attack on women”  —   because she relied on the abortion business to obtain birth control and condoms as a teenager. [“My mom was really religious with me when I was young,” Lawrence said. “She’s not so much anymore. And I wouldn’t have been able to get birth control if it weren’t for Planned P. I wouldn’t have been able to get condoms and birth control and all these things I needed as a normal teenager who was growing up in a Jesus house. ”  Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards tweeted the following link to the Glamour interview: Jennifer Lawrence: 👏 https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) January 5, 2016,  “I am a successful woman who has not had a pregnancy,” Lawrence touted, expressing confusion as to why some people are opposed to Planned Parenthood. “What harm comes from supplying people with birth control, condoms, Pap smears, and cancer screenings?” According to Planned Parenthood’s recently released 2015 annual report, despite the fact that the taxpayer funded organization’s “services” fell from 10. 5 million to 9. 5 million  —   a drop of 11 percent  —   it received a 4. 8 percent increase in taxpayer funds from $528. 4 million to $553. 7 million. Planned Parenthood is under investigation by several congressional committees for potentially criminal offenses following the discovery of the abortion business’ apparent practices of harvesting the body parts of aborted babies for sale on the open market and altering the position of unborn babies during abortion procedures in order to harvest intact organs. The   Congress approved a $1. 1 trillion omnibus spending bill in December that funded Planned Parenthood once again for most of 2016. This week, Republicans stand poised to vote to defund the organization in a “show vote” which President Barack Obama has threatened to veto. Asked how she describes her outspoken style, Lawrence says, “Slutty power lesbian. ” Glamour observes that Lawrence is “seriously ballsy, taking stands on issues like fair pay for women. ” When it was revealed that she had been paid far less than her male   on American Hustle, the actress responded in Lena Dunham’s newsletter Lenny, “I want to fly under the radar, but “my mouth has just made it impossible. ”
