An illegal immigrant who was ordered to leave the country a year ago is now being sought by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for allegedly raping an underage girl. [Ronald Fabricio Herrera Contreras, 18, is wanted by ICE and the Fairfax County Police Department in Virginia for allegedly raping a    girl abduction assault and battery and gang involvement, WJLA reported.  Contreras is accused by law enforcement of “dragging” the 15   into a wooded area and then proceeding to rape her. The alleged gang member was reportedly given a “final order of removal” in June 2015 when he was found by immigration officials in Hidalgo, Texas. ICE and Fairfax County police told local media that finding and arresting Contreras is now a top priority, partly due to the rape accusation and his illegal immigration status.
