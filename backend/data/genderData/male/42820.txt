 (CNN) The collapse of a military barracks in Russia has killed 23 people, the Tass news agency reported Monday, citing the country’s Defense Ministry. The wall and part of the roof of the Russian Airborne Troops training center barracks in the Omsk region collapsed Sunday evening, Tass reported. It said 19 people were hospitalized. Omsk is in southern Russia, just north of Kazakhstan.  The news agency quoted ”a regional law enforcement source” as saying the accident might have been caused by violations during repair work. ”The barracks in the village of Svetly recently underwent repairs,” the source said, according to Tass. ”According to one of the versions, errors possibly occurred during the repair, including a change in design of the building. This version will be checked.” The collapse took place shortly before 8 p. m. on Sunday, the agency reported. There were 337 servicemen inside the building at the time, Tass said.
