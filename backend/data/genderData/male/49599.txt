’  ’ ’   Stocks are getting a bit pricey. ’ ’   All three major indexes break though their   highs on a   seemingly daily basis, and this has pushed earnings multiples   higher and higher. ’ ’   The current   trailing    ratio of the   S&P 500 sits at 25. 95x, while the forward        is roughly 17. 1x, . Each of these is higher than its     average. ’ ”   In fact, based on one measure of valuation, the market hasn’t   been this expensive anytime other than before a massive crash. ” ’   The cyclical adjusted    ratio, better known as   Shiller   which adjusts the    ratio for   cyclical factors such as inflation, stands at . There   have only been a few instances in history when stocks have been   this expensive: just before the crash of 1929, the years leading   up to the tech bubble and its bursting, and around the financial   crisis of  . ’ ’   This does not necessarily mean that a crash is imminent  —   during   the tech bubble, the Shiller   made it well into the 30s before   coming back down. Additionally, there are some criticisms that   Shiller   is generally more   since it adjusts   for the cycle, so it may not be as accurate. ’ ’   Another caveat is that, during the three previous instances,   investors have been incredibly bullish on stocks (there’’s a   reason Robert Shiller’’s book is titled ””) and most indicators of sentiment  —   from the   American Association of Individual Investors to Bank of America   Merrill Lynch’’s   sentiment indicator  —   are still   depressed. ’ ”   Still, an elevated level for the Shiller   certainly isn’t   going to make it any easier to sleep at night. ” ’  ’
