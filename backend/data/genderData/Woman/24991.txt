President Barack Obama offered a measured assessment of Hillary Clinton, reminding guests at a fundraiser that she would be a different president, if elected in November. [“She’s not always the flashiest. She’s not always the person who’s going to give you the big  . But she is the person who’s going to do the work,” Obama said during a fundraiser for Clinton on Martha’s Vineyard.  Obama admitted that he supported Clinton because she was a Democrat, but that he also was impressed by her work ethic. “It is absolutely critical that we have a capable, visionary, hardworking, diligent, smart, tenacious leader in the Oval Office,” he said. “And that’s Hillary Clinton. That’s who she is. ” Obama failed to mention any part of Clinton’s achievements as Secretary of State, but pointed out that she traveled around the world “at a breathless pace” while managing global conflicts. “When I tell you that I’ve seen how she works not just with me, but with her staff and people below her in a way that is full of integrity and seriousness and good humor, it’s something that I’ve witnessed on a    basis,” he said. Obama explained that it was impossible to know how someone would perform as president, until they were sitting behind the desk with billions of lives at stake. “[I] will tell you that I have as good a guess when it comes to how Hillary will respond as I would of anybody’s, because I’ve seen her under really   situations. And that’s what’s needed right now,” he said.
