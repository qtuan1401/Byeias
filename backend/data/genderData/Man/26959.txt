Tuesday on CNN’s “Wolf,” a day before Wednesday’s House leadership election, Rep. Tim Ryan ( ) who is challenging Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) for the Democratic House leadership post, said he is within “striking distance” of winning.  Ryan said, “I think we’re within striking distance. I can tell you that for sure. A lot of members haven’t committed or are being very, very quiet and could break either way coming into the last 24 hours and the vote’s tomorrow morning. So I feel really, really good about the campaign we’ve run. I think we’ve been very clear. I think we’ve been very respectful of Leader Pelosi but need change and we’ll see if my colleagues agree tomorrow. ” He added, “We have a lot of commitments, more than most think and I think there is going to be a lot of surprised faces tomorrow. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
