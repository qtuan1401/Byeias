Friday on CNN’s “The Lead,” as police were still searching for the gunman who opened fire at several locations in and near the Olympia shopping mall in Munich, Germany, CNN aired a dramatic interview of the eyewitness account of a mother inside the McDonald’s who heard the shooter scream “Allahu Akbar!” and saw him targeting children.  The woman called Loretta for her safety, who was inches away from the gunman when he emerged from the men’s bathroom in McDonald’s, said, “My son saw in the toilet, the man loading his gun. It was a pistol. I come out of the toilet and I hear the  —   like an alarm boom boom boom. He is killing the children. They make nothing. They were sitting to eat. They can’t run. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
