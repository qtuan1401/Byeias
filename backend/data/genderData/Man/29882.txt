The FBI are investigating a potential hack of Democratic Party staffers’ cell phones, launching a request to examine a number of devices to check for evidence of a malicious attack. [Blaming the potential hack on “Russian hackers,” current DNC Chairman Donna Brazile declared that the DNC are “choosing not to provide general updates unless personal data or other sensitive information has been accessed or stolen,” claiming their “struggle” with the alleged Russian hackers is “ongoing. ”  After a series of hacks that exposed controversial material from both the Democratic National Committee and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in July and August, the DNC were quick to blame the breaches on Russia, despite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s rebuttal of these claims. “There are claims that in the meta data, someone has done a document in a PDF conversion, and that in some cases the language used in the documents is Russian, and therefore the computer that was used for that conversion was Russian,” said Assange in an August interview. “That is the circumstantial evidence that some Russian, or someone who wanted to make them look like a Russian, was involved, with these other media organisations,” he explained. “That is not the case for the material that we released. ” Previous leaks from the DNC have exposed numerous controversies, including how they allied with Hillary Clinton to actively work against Bernie Sanders’ campaign to become the Democratic presidential nominee.
