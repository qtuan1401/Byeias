’  ’ ’   Rep. Trey Gowdy on Thursday read FBI Director James Comey a   series of statements made by Hillary Clinton about her private   email setup and asked if the agency head would say whether each   were true. ’ ’   ”Secretary Clinton said she never sent or received classified   information over her private email. Was that true?” the South   Carolina Republican asked at the outset. ’ ’   Comey said that statement was false. ’ ’   ”Secretary Clinton said, ’’I did not email any classified material   to anyone on my email, there is no classified material. ’’ That was   true?” Gowdy asked. ’ ’   ”There was classified email,” Comey replied. ’ ’   Gowdy continued: ”Secretary Clinton said she used just one   device. Was that true?” ’ ’   ”She used multiple devices during the four years of her term as   secretary of state,” the FBI director said. ’ ’ ’ ’   ”Secretary Clinton said all   emails were returned to   the State Department,” Gowdy said. ’ ’   ”No,” Comey replied. ”We found thousands that were not returned.” ’ ’   ”Secretary Clinton said neither she nor anyone else deleted work   related emails from her personal account. Was that true?” Gowdy   asked. ’ ’   Comey said that question was ”harder” to answer, but   that ”  emails” were discovered in ”slack space.” ’ ’   ”Whether they were deleted or a server was changed out, something   happened to them. There’’s no doubt that the   emails   that were removed electronically from the email system,” he said. ’ ’   Gowdy had one final question: ”Secretary Clinton said her lawyers   read every one of the emails and were overly inclusive. Did her   lawyers read the email content individually?” ’ ’   ”No,” Comey said. ’ ”   Comey was on Capitol Hill testifying before Congress just days   after he announced the FBI would  against Hillary Clinton in the   bureau’s email probe. ” ’   Attorney General Loretta Lynch  Wednesday. ’
