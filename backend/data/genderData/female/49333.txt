’  ’ ”   From the time that we’re young until the end of our lives, we’re   most likely to injure ourselves while engaged in sports or   recreational activities in a simple way. ” ’   We fall down. ’ ”   That’s one of the main takeaways from a  that documents   and     injuries. Every year, there are about 8. 6 million of these   injuries requiring medical attention in the US. About half are   treated at doctor’s offices or clinics instead of emergency rooms   or hospitals. ” ’   More than a quarter of those injuries, 27. 9% are caused by   falls. Other common injury causes include overexertion, ”being   struck by or against a person or object,” and injuries sustained   in transportation related to sports or recreation. These are each   responsible for somewhere between 12% and 17% of sports injuries. ’ ’   The most common actual injuries are strains or sprains (41%)   broken bones (20%) and bruises or superficial injuries (19%).   Brain injuries like concussions represent only about 4. 5% of the   total. ’ ’’ ”   What’s perhaps most interesting about the study is the way that   the breakdown of injuries by age and gender tells the common   stories of our lives. ” ’   Kids ages   are most likely to hurt themselves on a playground   or engaged in ”general exercise,” the sort of running around you   might imagine for young kids. For ages   when many of us are   in high school and college, team sports become common  —   this is   where you see basketball, soccer, and football injuries make   their main appearance, especially for males. After age 25, those   sports become less common and people become more likely to hurt   themselves generally working out, running, biking, or while   engaged in water sports. ’ ’   Injuries can be serious, especially for older people, but when   you consider  the occasional sprain or strain   is probably worth it. Just make sure to get anything treated if   you get hurt so you can get moving again soon. ’
