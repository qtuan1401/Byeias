Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” former Gov. Howard Dean ( ) also the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, discussed what could happen in the aftermath of the contested efforts for the Democratic Party nomination between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ).  Dean said he expected Clinton to pick up most of Sanders’ supporters if she gets the Democratic Party’s nod, but said there will still be some that won’t support Clinton. “Well, look, nobody is going to be conciliatory at this stage of the game,” Dean said. “They’ve run what has turned out to be much nastier the campaign then I thought most of us thought. I thought your remarks in the earlier segment about how nasty it was under the surface, it was pretty bad. I had to deal with a bunch of older women who supported John McCain at the end over Hillary, I mean, over Obama. That’s going to happen. There are going to be some people who will do that. Hopefully it’s going to be headline grabbers and not substantial voters. ” “I don’t think it will be,” he continued. “I believe that all of but the hardest core of 10 percent of Bernie Sanders voters will end up voting for Hillary because it’s the right thing to do for the country,” he added. “And it’s the right thing for them to do to advance their own agenda as well. The truth is most revolutions in this country are incremental. They don’t happen overnight. That’s what the penalty of democracy is  —   you don’t get your changes overnight. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
