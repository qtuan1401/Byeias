It turned out that   the   packets yielded nearly the same amount of juice and in a slightly   shorter time, according to Bloomberg’s tests. ” ’’ ’   Now, Juicero is on the defensive and is arguing that its   juicer (whose price was already cut to $400) is needed   because ”t ’ ’   To Juicero, the value of the company is its connected juice press   that can tell you when the juice is about to expire and saves you   the two minutes of packet squeezing.  ’ ’   Like the juice packets, Juicero’’s refund offer also has an   expiration date: Customers need to return the machines in the   next 30 days. And don’’t expect Juicero to take care of the   shipping.
