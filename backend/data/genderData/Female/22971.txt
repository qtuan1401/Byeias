Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day,” Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol reacted to a piece by David Horowitz posted on Breitbart on Sunday labeling him a “Republican spoiler, renegade Jew. ”  Kristol told “New Day”   Alisyn Camerota he did not intend to read the piece and dismissed both the “renegade Jew” and “Republican spoiler” monikers by touting his support for Israel and his previous support for the Republican presidential candidates. “I don’t know. You should ask them,” he replied. “I haven’t read it and I don’t intend to read such a thing. It’s really, well  —   you should ask them. It’s pretty  —   there are always people like that. It’s a big country, a lot of people, and people can build their websites and engage in that kind of rhetoric or, and put on headlines on pieces like that, I suppose. I think I’m, I’m a proud Jew, strong supporter of Israel, I don’t think I’ve ever been called a renegade Jew before. That’s something new. I’ve been called a lot of things, Alisyn, over 30, 40 years, but never ‘renegade Jew.’ And ‘Republican spoiler’  —   I worked in the Reagan and Bush administrations. I’ve always voted Republican for president. This will be the first election after 11 times voting for a Republican presidential candidate that I can’t vote for the Republican nominee. I’m not happy about that. I like the party. Basically I think what they stand for has been correct over the years  —     tough on crime, limited government, constitutionalism. We’ve made  —   obviously the Republicans made mistakes as well. I’m not happy to say I can’t vote for the Republican nominee, but I just think I can’t this year. ” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
