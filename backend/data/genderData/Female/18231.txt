A Portland, Oregon, elementary school has given permission to a Satanist group to host an after school club for kids, a report says. [Sacramento Elementary School in Portland’s Parkrose School District recently agreed to allow the Satanist group to proselytize to kids as an “alternative” to a Christian after school club, Fox 12 Oregon reported.  The new after school club is being organized by a man named Finn Rezz in cooperation with Satanic Portland, a group that insists it is not about devil worship but instead advocates for the separation of church and state and “rational thinking. ” Rezz criticized the school for allowing the Christian club in the first place. “We believe that after school religious programs don’t belong in the school system,” he said. In reply, John Luck, a representative of the Christian program called Good News Club, said the Satanists are just perpetrating a publicity stunt. Luck also noted that no one was attacking the Satanists. In fact, it is the other way around. “They have the right to be there just as we do and you don’t see us opposing them. They are the ones opposing and bullying the Good News Club, not vice versa,” Luck said. Rezz told the media that his new after school Satan Club “will be held on Wednesdays once a month at the same time as the Good News Club. ” The school refused to make any public statements on the issue.
