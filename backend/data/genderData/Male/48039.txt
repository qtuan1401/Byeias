’  ’ ”   The US women’s gymnastics team made the team final a race for   silver. ” ’ the US women once   again flattened competition en route to an easy gold medal in the   team final. ’ ’   The US finished with a score of 184. 897  —   eight points better   than   China.  the gap between the   US and China was wider than the gap between China and     Brazil. ’ ’   The team finished with a bang on the floor.  before scoring a 14. 8, the best of the day, in one of   the biggest routines of her life. It was just the beginning,   though: Aly Raisman followed it up with a nearly flawless routine   for a 15. 3. ’ ”   It didn’t seem as if it could be topped, but then Simone Biles,   with the gold all but wrapped up  —   she needed just an eight  —     came out and put on a show. She scored an incredible 15. 8. ” ”   Amazingly, the US’s dominance came after a somewhat disappointing     performance. Biles stood out, as early on she twice   wobbled on the   beam.
