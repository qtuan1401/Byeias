 (CNN) Taylor Swift says she’s ”fine” with her generally   image. ”No, that’s a way of people saying I’m just not generally a sexy person. That’s all that is,” she told ”Access Hollywood.” ”It’s fine. I’ve accepted it. I’m a lot of things. Overtly sexy is not one of them. ”I’m fine. I’m fine with all the other things I am,” she added. And she doesn’t mind being a role model. ”I think for me it feels very natural to talk to teenagers and people my age . .. about feelings and what they’re going through and their insecurities,” she said. Her image certainly hasn’t hurt her drawing power.  Swift’s new single is ”Bad Blood,” which    of course    hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts. And she recently made Forbes magazine’s ”Most Powerful Women” list, coming in at No. 64. She’s the youngest person ever named to the list. ”I was really happy that they were willing to put that kind of title on a young person and say, ’We believe in what you stand for,’” she told the show. Dave Grohl admits he’s ’obsessed’ with Swift
