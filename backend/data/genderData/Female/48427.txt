”   One of the biggest surprise announcements at Apple’s iPhone event   on Wednesday was the introduction of  Apple’s totally wireless headphones. ” ’  ’ ’   AirPods really do look beautiful and futuristic, but one of the   first questions we had about these wireless headphones was about   theft. ’ ”   What happens if someone steals your AirPods? What if you’re on   the subway and someone snatches one or both out of your ears and   runs away? Does Apple have a way of preventing this kind of   theft? ” ’   The short answer, unfortunately, is no. ’ ”   Apple says that if AirPods are lost or stolen, you’ll have to buy   new ones, just like any other Apple product. There’s no     measures in place to protect your shiny wireless   earbuds. ” ’’ ”   That said, if one of your two AirPods is lost or stolen,   Apple says you’ll be able to buy just one. (Apple didn’t say how   much it would cost to buy just one.) ” ”   So there you have it. Until Apple creates some kind of Touch ID   for your ears, you’ll have very few security measures to ensure   your AirPods don’t get lost or stolen. So be careful with them  —     at $159, they’re not cheap. ” ’    ’
