’  ’ ”   Heather Bresch, the CEO of Mylan  —   which makes the EpiPen  —     is testifying in front of the House Oversight and   Government Reform Committee about the drug’s price after an   hourlong delay. ” ’   The price of the device, used in emergencies to treat  has increased more than 500% since   Mylan acquired it in 2007. A   of the EpiPen now has a   list price of $608. ’ ’   In her prepared testimony released ahead of the hearing, Bresch   gave background on Mylan as a company and addressed some of the   controversy around the rising price. ’ ’   ”Looking back, I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and   acceleration of the rising financial issues for a growing   minority of patients who may have ended up paying the full   [list] price or more,” Bresch said in her testimony. ”We   never intended this.” ’ ’   The members of Congress had a lot of questions for Bresch,   who will be testifying alongside Doug Throckmorton, a deputy   director of the Food and Drug Administration. In her defense, she   said the company is implementing a number of programs to help   patients pay for EpiPens. ’ ”   But Congress didn’t buy it. Here are a few highlights before   we get into the   : ” ’   Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the committee, kicked off   the hearing, saying, ”We’’ve got a lot of questions.” ’ ’   Right off the bat, he brought up his interest in learning more   about how much money Mylan makes off each EpiPen and how much   Mylan executives are compensated. He had questions about the lack   of existing competition that might have helped to   lower the cost of the device. ’ ’   ”Parents don’’t have a choice,” Chaffetz said. ’ ’  ’ ’   Cummings followed Chaffetz, saying he was ”not impressed” by   Bresch’’s prepared testimony and bringing out an EpiPen. He   accused the company of using a ”simple but corrupt business   model” to enrich themselves in the same manner as Martin Shkreli   of Turing Pharmaceuticals and executives at Valeant   Pharmaceuticals. ’ ”   He scoffed at Mylan’s promise to increase patient assistance   programs. ” ’   ”We’’ve heard that one before,” he said. ”They never ever lower   their prices. I’’m concerned this is a    strategy.” ’ ”   Cummings said he’s not sure he wants an apology from Mylan as   much as he wants solutions. ” ’   ”It’’s time for Congress to act,” Cummings said. ’ ”   He referenced Shkreli’s testimony earlier this year. ” ’   ”After the hearing, you know what he called us? Imbeciles. You   know why he said that? Because he knew he would go back and do   the same thing,” he said. ”So he took his punches  —   he      us. Even worse, he took the Fifth.  ’ ’   ”This is our moment. If we’’re going to do something in a   bipartisan way, this is it.” ’ ”   Bresch and Throckmorton gave their prepared statements,   which . Bresch defended herself and her   company. Throckmorton talked about the FDA’s efforts to ramp   up approval of generics. ” ”   But that’s not what anyone came here to see. It’s all about the   Q&A   . ” ’  ’ ’   Chaffetz asked a simple question to start: You raised the price  —     what did you think was going to happen? ’ ”   Bresch did a lot of gymnastics to explain how Mylan actually   doesn’t make that much money on the drug, but Chaffetz wasn’t   having it. ” ’   ”This doesn’’t make any sense,” he said. ”This is why we don’’t   believe you.” He turned to Throckmorton. ’ ’   ”I want to know how many epinephrine products are in the queue   right now?”  ’ ”   Throckmorton couldn’t answer. Chaffetz grew visibly frustrated,   and asked him to answer the question ASAP.  ” ’   ”It’’s simply an illegal answer. I’’m not allowed to disclose   confidential commercial information in this setting,”   Throckmorton said. ’ ”   Chaffetz said he would confer with his colleagues on that one.   Rep. John Mica followed up later, and Throckmorton still couldn’t   give an answer.  ” ’   Later in the evening, the FDA tweeted out a response to this   issue:  ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tFDA’s practice is not to disclose the number of pending applications since together   public info it could disclose applicant identity. ’t’t’ ”   Then Chaffetz turned to Bresch and asked about a USA Today   article that reported that Bresch’s mother    of the National Association of State Boards of Education to help   Mylan launch its EpiPen4schools program. ” ’   Bresch said the story was wrong and implied the company was being   punished for giving schools free EpiPens. ’ ’   ”I certainly thought it was a cheap shot to bring my mother into   this,” she said. ’ ”   That was Cummings’ question. He was trying to calculate how much   Mylan spends on marketing compared with how much it makes,   and he was walking through the public information available. ” ’   He found that information  —   and Bresch’’s answers  —   without it.   ”You’’re telling me you don’’t know how much you spent on patient   assistance programs and   programs in 2015?” ’ ’   Bresch said they spent maybe $105 per pack because the company   had to do so much work raising awareness about anaphylaxis. ’ ”   Cummings then asked Bresch how much she spent on research   and development in 2015. He asked twice; the second time he   asked          . Again, Bresch wasn’t prepared with   answers. ” ’   ”You knew what this hearing was about. I’’m asking questions that   if you’’re the CEO I think that you would know,” he said. ’ ’   He added later: ”Would you agree that you made hundreds of   millions of dollars on EpiPen in 2015 alone?” ’ ”   Bresch said that the EpiPen wasn’t all of Mylan’s $11 billion   revenue. ” ’   Cummings cut her off and repeated the question. Bresch said yes.   Then Cummings asked her to produce documents showing how much   Mylan made on the EpiPen. She had been asked to bring them to the   hearing, and she did not. ’ ’   Bresch mentioned that Mylan was working on developing an EpiPen   with a longer shelf life. Currently, the EpiPen expires after   about 12 months, and Bresch said that the hope is to   increase that to 24 months. ’ ’   Rep. Eleanor Norton was the one to ask the question everyone   wants the answer to: Will the price of the EpiPen actually come   down? ’ ”   Bresch said that introducing an  was the most efficient way to make   that happen, saying that if the   price went down,   it wouldn’t necessarily make its way to patients.  ” ’   Norton then followed up on Bresch’’s compensation. ”What have   you done to earn this 671% [compensation] increase?” ’ ’   Bresch first replied that she earned it because her company has   saved the US billions. ’ ’   ”Our products alone have saved the country $180 billion,” she   said a few times. ’ ”   But that wasn’t good enough for Norton. She followed up, asking   what she has done for this product, the EpiPen. Bresch   pointed to the EpiPens Mylan has provided to schools and   public places. ” ’   Rep. Stephen Lynch pressed the question of how much Mylan makes   off an EpiPen. ’ ’   Using poster boards, Bresch tried to illustrate the point that   Mylan currently makes about $275 off of each   of EpiPens,   with a profit of about $50. ’ ’   In 2014, when the list price was about $400, Bresch said the   company got $235 from each   and about $40 in profit   off each. Bresch said that the $300 authorized generic would make   less than the $50 profit that the company is making today.  ’ ’   Bresch later told Rep. Scott DesJarlais that she did not plan on   increasing the price of the EpiPen in 2017.  ’ ’   DesJarlais then asked, ”Do you think you were charging too much   at $600?” ’ ’   ”We believe it was a fair price, and we’’ve just now lowered that   by half,” Bresch said. ’ ’   But, DesJarlais asked, if she thought it was fair, why lower   at all? ’ ”   That has to do with more people paying closer to the list price,   Bresch said  —   something that she said wasn’t intended.  ” ’   A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that deductibles,   the amount of money a person with insurance is on the hook for,    in the past five years. ’ ’  ’ ”   Duckworth went off on Mylan’s EpiPen4Schools program. To get the   drug, schools have to promise not to buy it from anyone else. ” ’   ”That, to me, is an unfair monopoly,” she said. ’ ”   Bresch said the schools don’t have to buy them if they don’t want   to. ” ’   ”That’’s right, they don’’t have to buy them, but your own mother   is out there . .. passing out your guides for Mylan,” Duckworth   said. ’ ”   She added that some of the schools being lobbied by Bresch’s   mother, who was president of the National Association of   State Boards of Education, had no clue about her connection to   the CEO. ” ”   Bresch said this simply wasn’t true. ” ”   Rep. Mick Mulvaney also talked about government intervention   in the project. He said his colleagues mostly asked questions   about an industry it doesn’t understand. ” ’   ”I’’ll tell you what we do know, though, is that you’’ve been in   our hallways to ask us to make people buy your stuff,” he said,   saying that 11 states have laws requiring EpiPens   be available in schools. ”You’’ve lobbied us to make the   taxpayer buy your stuff. . .. I was here when we did it.” ’ ’  ’ ’   He continued: ”You came and you asked the government to get in   your business, so here we are today. And I was as uncomfortable   with some of these questions as you were . .. but I have to   defend both my Republican and Democrat colleagues for these   questions because you’’ve asked for it, so I guess this is my   message. ’ ’   ”If you want to come to Washington, if you want to come to the   state capitol and lobby us to make us buy your stuff, this is   what you get. You get a level of scrutiny and a level of   treatment that would ordinarily curl my hair, but you asked for   it!” ’ ’   And with that, Chaffetz called a recess. ’ ”   After an hour and a half rececess, Congress came back in looking   for answers about why it takes so long for generic drugs to get   approved, and had some more questions about the EpiPen’s price   and how much money Mylan makes from it. ” ’   Rep. Peter Welch recounted one letter he received from a single   mother with a    who was facing problems paying for   the drug. It left her in a tricky position: ”I can’t afford to   pay this much for EpiPens and I can’t afford not to,” she wrote   to Welch. ’ ”   Welch, whose state Vermont is home to a Mylan facility, was   curious about why, if the number of EpiPens sold has gone up, why   the   cost hasn’t gone down as it typically. Bresch said   that the cost of goods has actually gone up. ” ’   Rep. Earl ”Buddy” Carter, a pharmacist, got into the issue of   pharmacy benefits managers, or companies that negotiate the price   of drugs that serve as a middleman. It’’s a group of companies   that he’’s interested in investigating as part of the reason that   patients are feeling the rising cost of prescription drugs.  ’ ’   He asked Bresch’’s opinion on looking into this issue, to which   she replied: ”I certainly would agree that transparency is   needed. . .. The system hasn’t kept pace with the evolution of the   healthcare system.” ’ ”   In addressing the issue of PBMs, though, Bresch brought up the   company’s authorized generic, which didn’t go over well.  ” ’   ”You know I know better than that,” Carter said. ”Don’t try to   convince me that you’re doing us a favor.” Carter said that if   Mylan had cut the list price of their drug in the first place,   they wouldn’’t have received rebates from the PBMs. Carter asked   Bresch to follow up with more details about Mylan’’s contracts   with PBMs. ’ ”   Changing gears, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman asked how Bresch   showed up to the hearing. Bresch said she had flown in from   Pittsburgh, where Mylan’s US corporate offices are based on a   private jet.  ” ”   Coleman then got into the issue of Mylan’s tax rates. Last year,   Mylan incorporated its headquarters in the Netherlands. Mylan now   has a tax rate of  % down from the    twenties it   was a year earlier.  ” ’   That move, Coleman pointed out, makes it so Mylan’’s paying less   on its taxes than the everyday American. Coleman also asked if   anything happens out of the Netherlands. Bresch said   ”physically,” the company is run out of the company’’s Pennsyvania   offices, which is where she and other executives are based.  ’ ’   ”This is a sham and a shell, and it’’s really sad to hear this,”   Coleman said.  ’ ’   Chaffetz, coming back for another round of questions, wanted to   know more about what’’s going on with the . It’’s currently   classified as a ”  Multiple Source Drug,”   different from a branded drug. Although Bresch hadn’’t been   directly involved in recent conversations with CMS, she did try   to answer the question of why it’’s classified like that. Bresch   said the EpiPen was in that status before Mylan acquired the   drug, and that at several other times, the company confirmed that   that was the right status.  ’ ’   Toward the end of the hearing, Cummings sounded exasperated   by the responses Bresch had given. ’ ’   ”If I could sum up this hearing, it would be that the numbers   don’t add up,” Cummings said. ”It is extremely difficult to   believe that you’re making only $50 when you’ve just   increased the price by more than $100.” ’ ”   Cummings sounded a bit jaded after dealing with companies like   Turing Pharmaceuticals and Valeant Pharmaceuticals in past   hearings, saying that this sounded a lot like the talking points   he’s heard before. So, he emphasized the need to see some   documents and records. ” ’   Chaffetz agreed that something spelled fishy. ”It just feels like   you’re not being honest with us,” he said, pointing to some of   the numbers and charts Bresch had used during the hearing, which   he said seemed dumbed down.  ’ ”   Bresch and Throckmorton will now have 10 days to provide the   committee with more documents to answer some of the questions   that they couldn’t fully answer on the spot. ”
