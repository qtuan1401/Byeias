’  ’ ’   One day, not too soon  —   but still sooner than you   think  —   the smartphone will all but vanish, like beepers and   fax machines before it.  ’ ”   Make no mistake, we’re still probably at least a decade away from   any kind of meaningful shift away from the smartphone. (And    I’ll happily eat my words.   Assuming we’re still eating at all, I guess.) ” ’   Yet, piece by piece, the groundwork for the eventual demise of   the smartphone is being laid by  by Microsoft, by Facebook, by Amazon,   and a countless number of startups that still have a part to   play. ’ ”   And, let me tell you: If and when the smartphone does die, that’s   when things are going to get really weird for   everybody. Not just in terms of individual products, but in terms   of how we actually live our everyday lives and maybe our humanity   itself. ” ”   Here’s a brief look at the slow, ceaseless march towards the   death of the smartphone  —   and what the   world   is shaping up to look like.  ” ’   People think of the iPhone and the smartphones it inspired as   revolutionary devices  —   small enough to carry everywhere,   hefty enough to handle an increasingly large number of our daily   tasks, and packed full of the right mix cameras and GPS sensors   to make apps like Snapchat and Uber uniquely possible.  ’ ’   But consider the smartphone from another perspective. The desktop   PC and the laptop are made up of some combination of a mouse,   keyboard, and monitor. The smartphone just took that model,   shrunk it down, and made the input virtual and    .  ’ ”   So take, for example, the  unveiled this week. It’s gorgeous with an   amazing   screen and some real power under the hood.   It’s impressive, but it’s more refinement than revolution. ” ’  ’ ”   Tellingly, though, the Galaxy S8 ships with  a new virtual assistant that Samsung promises   will one day let you control every single feature and app with   just your voice. It will also ship with a new version of the Gear   VR virtual reality headset, developed in conjunction with   Facebook’s Oculus. ” ’   The next iPhone, too, is said to be shipping with upgrades to the   Siri assistant, along with .  ’ ’   And as devices like the  and the  continue to enjoy limited but substantial   success, expect to see a lot more tech companies large and small   taking more gambles and making more experiments on the next big   wave in computing interfaces.  ’ ’   In the   all of these various experimental and     technologies are going to start to congeal into   something familiar, but bizarre.  ’ ’   Microsoft, Facebook, Google and the  are all working to build standalone   augmented reality headsets, which project detailed 3D images   straight into your eyes. . ’ ” that   augmented reality could   replace the smartphone, the TV,   and anything else with a screen. There’s not much use for a   separate device sitting in your pocket or on your entertainment   center, if all your calls, chats, movies, and games are beamed   into your eyes and overlaid on the world around you.  ” ’  ’ ”   Meanwhile, gadgetry like the Amazon Echo or  become more and more important in this world. As   artificial intelligence systems like Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s   Alexa, Samsung’s Bixby, and Microsoft’s Cortana get smarter,   there’s going to be a rise not just in talking to computers, but   having them talk back. ” ”   In other words, computers are going to hijack your senses, more   so than they already do, with your sight and your hearing   intermediated by technology. It’s a little scary. . ” ’   The promise, though, is a world where real life and technology   blend more seamlessly. The major tech companies promise that this   future means a world of fewer technological distractions and more   balance, as the physical and digital world become the same thing.   You decide how you feel about that. ’ ”   Still, all those   investments in the future still rely   on gadgetry that you have to wear on you, even if it’s only a   pair of glasses. Some of the craziest, most   most   unpredictable advancements go even further  —   provided you’re   willing to wait a few extra decades, that is. ” ’   This week, we got  with a goal of building computers into our brains by way   of ”neural lace,” a  that lays on your brain and   bridges it to a computer. It’’s the next step beyond   even that blending of the digital and physical worlds, as   man and machine become one.  ’ ’   Assuming the science works  —   and   —    this   is the logical endpoint of the road that smartphones started us   on. If smartphones gave us access to information and augmented   reality puts that information in front of us when we need it,   then putting neural lace in our brains just closes the gap. ’ ’  ’ ”   Musk has said that this is because the rise of artificial   intelligence  —   which underpins a lot of the other   technologies, including voice assistants and virtual   reality  —   means that humans are going to have to augment   themselves just to keep up with the machines. If you’re really   curious about this idea, .  ” ’   The idea of   fusion is a terrifying one, with science   fiction writers, technologists, and philosophers alike having   very good cause to ask what even makes us human in the first   place. At the same time, the idea is so new that nobody really   knows what this world would look like in practice. ’ ”   So if and when the smartphone dies, it’ll actually be the end of   an era in more ways than one. It’ll be the end of machines that   we carry with us passively and the beginning of something that   bridges our bodies straight into the ebb and flow of digital   information. It’s going to get weird.  ” ”   And yet, lots of technologists already say that smartphones give   us superpowers with access to knowledge, wisdom, and abilities   beyond anything nature gave us. In some ways, augmenting the   human mind would be the ultimate superpower. Then again, maybe   I’m just an optimist. ” ’One day, not too soon  —   but still sooner. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
