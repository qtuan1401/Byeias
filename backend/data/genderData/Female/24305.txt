John Bassett III, chairman of the   furniture company, joined Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Friday to talk about his experience visiting Normandy, as chronicled in his book Making It in America: A   Plan for Growing Your Business and Keeping Jobs at Home. [“I’m getting older, but I served in the military for six years. I had three   . One of them went to Annapolis. The other two served in the military. We all served in the military,” Bassett recalled.   “Well, that was back in the days of the draft. Today, you don’t have to serve in the military unless you’re a volunteer. I wanted to show my family before I died what this country did,” he continued. “So I took seventeen of them. I put my children, their spouses, and all the grandchildren, and I took them to Normandy. I wanted to walk on the beaches. I wanted to see the hills. I wanted them to see the cliffs and how we overcame that. ” “The Germans were dug in. These guys didn’t back down. They did not back down. They accomplished the greatest amphibious landing in the history of the world,” he said. “We succeeded. We had partners. We had the British and the Canadians who were there with us, but literally half the beaches were controlled by Americans. ” Bassett said visiting Normandy was a “moving experience,” especially when completed with a visit to “that beautiful cemetery. ” “Americans today need to know just what we are made of,” he declared. “When you walk those beaches of Normandy, you know what this country stands for. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
