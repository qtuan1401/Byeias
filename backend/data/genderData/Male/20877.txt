The latest guest on this week’s edition of The Milo Yiannopoulos Show is U. S. Navy SEAL veteran and former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince. [On the topic of women in combat units, Prince said it was a difficult subject because if he gives his opinion “people just say you’re a guy and a misogynist. ”  “But then I tell them to look at the science,” he said. “The Marine Corps did a very thorough job of collecting the science, they put sensors in a mixed unit, and they put on a 90 day simulated combat field exercise in California. ” Having collected all the data, “they found significant unit   compared to the all male unit,” he said. “As a society we really have to debate, do we want an effective military, or a politically happy correct one?” Milo added that it was “intrinsically horrifying that we live in a society where we expect our women to fight on the front lines. ” Prince concluded that “when you look at the thousands of wounded vets who have come back, from Iraq and Afghanistan, the vast majority of those are males. Would American society be happy for half of them to be females? I don’t think so. ” “As a nation the most important thing or not to consider is how do you win or lose that war. We must win, and to make that a secondary consideration to political correctness it’s societal suicide,” he continued. You can subscribe to the Milo Yiannopoulos Show for free on iTunes.
