Network newscasts devoted 50 times more   to Khizr Khan, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention about his son who was killed in combat while in Iraq, than to Pat Smith, who spoke at the Republican National Convention about her son who died in Benghazi. [According to the Media Research Center, from July 19 to Aug. 1, ABC, CBS, and NBC devoted only one minute and 10 seconds to covering Smith.  However, the same networks managed to spend 55 minutes and 13 seconds covering Khan. The Media Research Center report details the coverage breakdown per network: Coverage of Pat Smith:ABC: 13 secondsCBS: 3 secondsNBC: 54 secondsTOTAL: 1 minute, 10 seconds, Coverage of Khizir Khan:ABC: 14 minutes, 21 secondsCBS: 9 minutes, 13 secondsNBC: 31 minutes, 39 secondsTOTAL: 55 minutes, 13 seconds, “This is a textbook case of   : One of these stories (the Khan story) matched the Democratic agenda, and the partisan media couldn’t push it hard enough. The other (the Smith story) reflected poorly on the Democratic nominee, so it was barely mentioned,” writes Media Research Center’s Geoffrey Dickens.
