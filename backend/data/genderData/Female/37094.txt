 (CNN) Finally we know what that video in the workshop was all about. Frank Ocean released a ”visual album” late Thursday. Titled ”Endless,” it was streamed on his site and Apple Music. The 12 songs and interludes, including an earlier released version of Aaliyah’s cover of the Isley Brothers’ ”At Your Best (You Are Love),” runs for 45 minutes over a    film shot by Francisco Soriano. In it, three versions of Ocean work on a building project in a warehouse.  Ocean has a few collaborations on the album, including with RB singer Jazmine Sullivan, Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood and British artist James Blake.  Fans have been eagerly awaiting a sophomore album from Ocean for the past four years. Seriously Frank Ocean, where is your new album? But the expectation for new music heated up in recent weeks after Ocean’s brother posted a photo on Instagram with the title ’Boys Don’t Cry.” Rolling Stone reported that the ”Boys Don’t Cry” album is still happening    just not under that name. ”That album, set for release by Apple this weekend, was previously called Boys Don’t Cry, but Rolling Stone has learned that the singer has scrapped that title in favor of an alternate title,” according to the publication.
