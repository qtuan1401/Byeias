Steve Ronnebeck called into Breitbart News Daily to discuss the death of his    son, Grant Ronnebeck, at the hands of an illegal immigrant free on bond. [The alien was a   member of the Sinola drug cartel. Accused of a violent home invasion and   rape attack, he shot Ronnebeck   over a pack of cigarettes.  Mesa held a candlelight vigil for Grant on January 22 to mark the anniversary of the terrible crime. Grant’s father, Steve, spoke to the crowd who gathered at the QT in Mesa, located near Stapley and Broadway. Along with mourners, Congressman Matt Salmon also showed up, as did Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu. Sheriff Babeu told ABC15 that Grant’s death “is a tragedy. ” Since Ronnebeck’s death, his family has been pushing for better immigration laws, especially when it comes to undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds. Ronnebeck’s alleged shooter is Apolinar Altamirano, 30, who may face the death penalty in the case. Mesa police officials say Altamirano shot Ronnebeck over a pack of cigarettes. The elder Ronnebeck, not an outspoken voice to improve America’s immigration laws, discussed the original crime, his son and his efforts going forward with host Stephen K. Bannon.
