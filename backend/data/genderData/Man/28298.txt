Lol, just kidding. Here are some pictures of the actual event.[ Remember #levelup panel, cancelled by #sxsw and then reinstated? It’s not drawing a big crowd #onlineharassment, A photo posted by Omar Gallaga (@omargee) on Mar 12, 2016 at 2:58pm PST,    Five minutes before start, attendance at the first three #sxsw Online Harassment Summit panels. A photo posted by Omar Gallaga (@omargee) on Mar 12, 2016 at 7:26am PST,  Serial online abuser Randi Harper, a particularly ironic supporter of the event, spent much of her time anxiously glancing at other people’s phones, looking for   spies. One nefarious troll decided to exploit this, with flawless success.  In other news, mad social justice warrior Brianna Wu thinks I’m at SXSW (I’m in Alaska, dummy!) and is very, very concerned. So apparently, if Brietbart wants they can pay for a ticket and cover it as a member of the public? Will tweet as I hear more.  —   Brianna Wu (@Spacekatgal) March 12, 2016,  . @Spacekatgal we worked all this out weeks ago. You weren’t a part of the conversation. Milo is not here. Please stop.  —   Randi Lee Harper (@randileeharper) March 12, 2016,  I can still strike fear into the hearts of SJWs, even when I’m four thousand miles away!
