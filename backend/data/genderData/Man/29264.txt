New York’s attorney general wrote the NFL expressing “serious concerns” about league scouting events “that may violate New York State law concerning sexual orientation discrimination. ”[Eric Schneiderman’s missive comes in the wake of an Atlanta Falcons coach asking Ohio State cornerback Eli Apple at the NFL Combine: “So, do you like men?” A coach at the Senior Bowl also allegedly asked Michael Sam’s agent in 2014 if he “had seen [Sam] around girls. ” Sam subsequently revealed his homosexuality well in advance of that year’s draft.  Schneiderman demands that the league provide him an inventory of reports of similar odd questions and incidents, chronicle discipline meted out, and provide a “detailed summary” of steps taken by the NFL to curb discrimination against homosexuals. “This incident highlights the need for the League to, at minimum, require head and assistant coaches, as well as franchise scouts, to complete an enhanced training on the League’s   policy,” Schneiderman maintained about the Apple questioning, “including sexual orientation   and their responsibilities to abide by and enforce the policy. ”
