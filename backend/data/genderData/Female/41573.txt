The force must be strong with Marc   a digital designer turned padawan who yields a precision knife like it’s a light saber. He picked some of his favorite scenes from the original Star Wars movies and carved them out of 8. 27 by 11.  sheets of paper: ”I use an   knife and I’m never frugal about saving fresh blades. A metal ruler and a cutting matt. That’s it really. Oh, and a few skewers to pop out small sections.” The technique he uses is known as kirigami, a variation of origami that involves cutting and folding    whereas origami is just folding    which is traditionally used to create architectural replicas. ”These are the product of a lot of patience and a lot of trial and error,” he says. ”For me, though, I link this back to my childhood. I’ve always made things out of stuff you’d otherwise put in the bin. My currency was toilet roll tubes and cereal boxes. I would make fortresses for my action figures out all sorts of things. Cleaned out tin cans with both ends opened made perfect sewer pipes for Teenage Mutant Ninja turtle action figures.” The project, called Cut Scene, is now the subject of a Kickstarter campaign to make it into an exhibition.
