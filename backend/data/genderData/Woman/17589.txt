It is no longer safe for a gay man to give a talk on an American university campus. [That’s the message we’re left with today, after campus police at the University Of Central Florida, Orlando, cancelled a scheduled event with Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos following threats of violence on social media.  Brett Meade, Deputy Chief of Police at UCF said he made an executive decision to postpone the event due to lack of resources to assure Milo’s security. They have 70 officers deployed for tonight’s vigil at the university and “cannot guarantee focus” on anything but that event. Meade provided Milo’s tour manager, Tim Treadstone, with a folder of threats made against the Breitbart Tech editor on social media. Milo’s team is in touch with the police department, and have been assured that adequate protection can be provided on an alternate day of the week. Breitbart will be provided with private security if necessary, to ensure the event can go ahead. In a comment, Milo said “I came to America to avoid the wave of Islamisation and the   response from journalists and politicians to Islamist thugs threatening gays, women and others. We won’t be silenced. “A press conference will proceed tomorrow no matter what, whether or not the local police can guarantee my safety. ”
