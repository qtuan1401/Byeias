Actor Woody Harrelson is almost as famous for his outspoken advocacy of marijuana as he is for his movie roles, but now, after 30 years of advocacy, Harrelson is swearing off pot.

Just 30 solid years of just partying too f***ing hard. ” This might shock some of the actor’s   fans. After all, Harrelson has been a longtime fan of pot. So much so that he has publicly supported the marijuana organization NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) has served on the organization’s board, and even once applied to open a medical marijuana dispensary in Hawaii.

I think it’s a great drug, in terms of  …     Even cops say that the side effect is euphoria. Or the   …     what do you call it?  …     The effect of it is euphoria,” he said. “But when you’re doing it all the time, it just becomes   …     Well, you know. I feel like it was keeping me from being emotionally available. I really don’t want this interview to turn into a whole thing about that. ”   Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.
