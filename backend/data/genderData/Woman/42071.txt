 (CNN) New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie joined a team of celebrities at Yankee Stadium and 17, 000 fans Wednesday for a charity softball game to honor slain police officers.  The governor, who is expected to announce a presidential campaign later this summer, did not disappoint. Video from NJ. com: Coincidentally, Christie’s   took place on the 127th anniversary of the publication of the famous poem, ”Casey at the Bat,” by Ernest Lawrence Thayer. But unlike the Mighty Casey, Christie connected.  The charity event was organized to memorialize NYPD police officers Brian Moore, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, who were recently slain in the line of duty. The funds raised were for two charities    the Silver Shield Foundation and the NYC PBA Widows and Children’s Fund    and the three officers’ families.
