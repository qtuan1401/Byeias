.@RepMcCaul talks about a proposed bill that would revoke Hillary Clinton’s security clearancehttps:  .  Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Rep. Michael McCaul ( ) discussed legislation he was introducing which would revoke the security clearance for those demonstrating “extreme carelessness” with classified information, which is what FBI Director James Comey described presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of an email server while secretary of state.  “The FBI director said she exercised extreme carelessness in her handling of classified information,” McCaul said. “So we simply introduced a bill, legislation that if you exercise ‘extreme carelessness,’ rather than gross negligence that your security clearance will be revoked or any application will be denied. It’s just as simple as that. I think it sends a strong message to the community out there that if you hold security clearances as to what the standard really is. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
