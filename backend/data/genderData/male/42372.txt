Washington (CNN) When Jeb Bush announces his presidential bid on Monday afternoon, the Republican field to will stand at 11 announced candidates. But the field could grow even further in the coming months, as several others are expected to make the plunge. Here are the biggest names left who have yet to announce their plans: Chris Christie  At one point, shortly after the 2012 race, Christie looked like one of the best options for moderate Republicans looking for a viable candidate in 2016. Then came Bridgegate, which put his hopes on hold through much of 2014. Perhaps a hint of things to come, Christie’s wife stepped down from her Wall Street job two months ago to spend more time with the family since the governor has ramped up his time on the road. In a new video released Sunday the New Jersey governor all but declares his candidacy, as the video ends with ”Christie 2016” in large type but his official announcement is expected Tuesday. John Kasich  The   Ohio governor may not have the pizazz or flash of some other candidates, but he has taken a few swipes at Jeb Bush, who stand on the same patch of   territory. Kasich has his work cut out for him in the polls, but he has hired some of the veterans behind John McCain’s 2008 messaging to work on   group working on his behalf. Two sources, who are familiar with the plan, tell CNN that Kasich plans to announce that he is running for the Republican presidential nomination on July 21. Scott Walker  The Wisconsin governor has consistently said he plans to formally announce his plans after state lawmakers finish work on their session at the end of June. His stump speech is   at this point    he won three elections in four years. A Walker bid does face challenges though    he would be the only candidate without a college degree and faces legal scrutiny from his time as Milwaukee county executive and his first run for governor.
