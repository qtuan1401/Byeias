Two men and three women were taking into custody early Tuesday morning after allegedly opening fire on police from inside an SUV. [The incident occurred just after midnight in Southeast DC.  According to Fox 5, officers with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) responded to call about gunfire in the “3200 block of 6th Street near Martin Luther King Elementary School. ” When they arrived, the occupants of an SUV —  two men, three women —  allegedly opened fire on the officers then “barricaded themselves in the vehicle” when police returned fire. Officers persuaded the five individuals to exit the vehicle 30 minutes later and all five were taken into custody. WMAL reports that MPD spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said, “There is not indication that this was a planned attack on police. ” Rather, Sternbeck said the MPD believes the five were involved in a crime prior to officers arriving on scene and simply opened fire thereafter.
