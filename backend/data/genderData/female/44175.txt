’  ’ ”   The   Democratic National Committee chairman Tom   Perez has asked all of the organization’s staffers to  as part of a move to   completely overhaul the makeup of the committee, NBC News   reported on Tuesday. ” ’   All staff are now subject to interviews by a committee advising   Perez on his transition, who will determine which staffers are   allowed to stay, which will be terminated, and how Perez will   seek to remake the committee. ’ ’   It is normal for staffing turnovers to take place when a new   chairperson is elected, though according to NBC, current staff   levels are at an unusual low. ’ ”   Perez’s spokeswoman told the network that the process was started   before Perez was elected, adding that he sought to ready the DNC   for future elections. ” ’   Perez was  as the new DNC chairman in February with 235 votes,   beating Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota for the position. ’ ”   Unity was a key theme in Perez’s victory speech, and he followed   that up by immediately naming the defeated Ellison as the deputy   chairman of the DNC, a   position, as an olive   branch. Ellison likewise called for unity in his concession   speech, and asked all of his supporters to pledge support for   Perez. ” ’The   Democratic National Committee. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
