The New York Times Magazine won three National Magazine Awards on Tuesday, tying New York Magazine for the most awards for any publication this year. The winning stories showcased a wide range of reporting and storytelling, at home and abroad: • In the Public Interest category, “Worlds Apart,” by our staff writer Nikole   tells the story of  ’s own process of finding a school for her daughter in New York City, among the most segregated public school systems in the country. Expertly weaving together the personal and the historical, supported by a wealth of research and data,   made the case that  —   more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education  —   the majority of poor black and Latino children received a separate and unequal education. • The winning story in the Feature Writing category, “I Have No Choice but to Keep Looking,” by our contributing writer Jennifer Percy, visits the coast of Japan, where more than five years after the tsunami that killed tens of thousands, the families of the dead still search the sea for their loved ones  —   a heartbreaking testament to love and devotion in the face of unimaginable loss. • In the   category, “David’s Ankles,” by our staff writer Sam Anderson, explores Anderson’s obsession with the history of Michelangelo’s David statue and its flaws while unspooling a meditation on the nature of imperfection itself.
