’  ’ ’   In his YouTube videos, PewDiePie is boisterous and goofy, playing   video games and swearing enough to make a sailor nod in approval. ’ ’   But in person,    Felix Kjellberg (PewDiePie) is much   more introverted, according to a colleague who worked closely   with him on “Scare PewDiePie,” his recently canceled show on   YouTube’s “Red” premium video service. ’ ’   “He was very charismatic and likeable,” the person said, but   introverted at the same time. “Felix was much more reserved in   real life. ” When Kjellberg would be recognized by people outside   the production, his demeanor would change, and he’d become a bit   shy and quiet, this person recalled. ’ ”   I’m not going to try and parse out the exact extent of the   overlap between Felix Kjellberg the person and PewDiePie the   character. But this anecdote serves as a good reminder that   PewDiePie is indeed a character, and one that has been richly   rewarded by a YouTube community that likes characters who push   boundaries. ” ’   PewDiePie is YouTube’s biggest star, with over 53 million   subscribers and a reported income of $15 million in 2016. ’ ’   This week, however, he has a dramatic fall from grace after a    concluded he had posted nine   videos since August that ”include   jokes or Nazi   imagery.” ’ ’   In the aftermath, YouTube canceled his premium show and kicked   him off its preferred advertising network, while Disney, whose   Maker Studios had a joint venture with him, . ’ ’  ’ ’   Kjellberg  in an explosive video where he called the report   “an attack by the media to try and discredit me, to try and   decrease my influence, and my economic worth.”   While  admitted that  was a joke gone too far, he defended his   right to make jokes about any subject, and literally flipped a   middle finger at the The Wall Street Journal. ’ ”   While Kjellberg may have lost lucrative deals with his biggest   brand partners, he doesn’t appear to have suffered any drop in   subscribers since the report. He remains the world’s most popular   YouTuber.  ” ’   In retrospect, it seems inevitable that a scandal of this type   would emerge in the rapidly changing world of YouTube stardom.   YouTube stars are now getting their own shows on traditional TV,   Netflix, and HBO, not to mention newer streaming services like   YouTube Red or Verizon’s Go90. ’ ’   They are superstars, and many are intertwined now with networks,   both TV and streaming, as well as companies like Disney’s Maker   Studios, which help develop and promote shows for the likes of   Kjellberg. ’ ”   But even if a YouTube star gets a “premium” show, most,   like continue to make their own   videos on YouTube, which speak directly to their fans and are   outside a brand’s control. They want to continue to grow and   serve their audience. And brand partners like Disney don’t want   them to stop building their fan base. ” ”   The problem, for the Disneys of the world, is that one way   many YouTube stars have climbed the ranks of popularity, snagging   millions and millions of subscribers, is through unfiltered, raw   personality. “I like to push boundaries,” Kjellberg said in his   . It’s certainly true, and he’s   not the only one. A relative strength of YouTube as a platform is   that people can say whatever they want. ” ’   This came into focus  with Fullscreen’s   SVP of programming, Scott Reich. Fullscreen both helps promote     YouTubers and also has its own     subscription service (though it has no affiliation with   PewDiePie). ’ ’   “We want [stars] to have a polarizing point of view   …     a   point of view in general,” Reich said. ’ ’   Strong opinions and personalities (or characters) are what makes   YouTube special, but they can end up being a liability for brands   like Disney. ’ ’   “Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and   irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the   resulting videos are inappropriate,”   Maker Studios   said in a statement to Business Insider explaining why the   company dropped him. ’ ’   Even within that statement, you can see the opposing forces that   led to the current situation. ’ ’   “Maker has all these young kids that have grown up creating   content without any kind of parameters,” Kjellberg’s colleague on   ”Scare PewDiePie” said. Someone was going to eventually step over   the line, and lose the support of Disney. It happened to be   Kjellberg, the entire ecosystem’s biggest star. ’ ’  ’ ’   One question as we sit in the fallout of the Journal report is   who gets hurt financially in this scenario. ’ ’   Both Disney and YouTube will no longer reap any  of the   revenue that comes from partnering with PewDiePie, but that   was their own business calculus. They made the wrong bet on   a star, and have decided to protect themselves from any potential   damage to their brands. ’ ’   Kjellberg, likewise, will no doubt lose some income. But he still   has 53 million followers, and has not been banned from YouTube.   The question will be how much of the income that he has lost from   brands can he build back up, or whether he even wants do. In   Kjellberg’s  video, he said that he “generally had very   little interest” in the money. ’ ’   Then there is the   production company that made “Scare   PewDiePie,” which was about to air its second season. Multiple   people with knowledge of YouTube Red deals said that   company will almost certainly be paid out in full. But it   still means that a show many people worked on for months will   never see the light of day. ’ ’   “Bummed and frustrated about the whole situation,”   another member of the “Scare PewDiePie” team told Business   Insider. ’ ’   What remains to be seen is whether this incident will have a   chilling effect on the willingness of established brands to tie   their fortunes, in some way, to stars with a track record of   controversial humor. Or whether they will seek to have greater   control over the YouTube output of the stars they bet   millions on. ’ ’In his YouTube videos, PewDiePie is boisterous. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
