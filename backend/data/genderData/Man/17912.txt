Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Nicolle Wallace, the former communications chief for George W. Bush’s 2004   campaign and adviser for Sen. John McCain’s ( ) 2008 presidential bid suggested Republicans beyond social conservatives, particularly those with a focus on foreign policy, should consider Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton.  “The conversations happening in private with Republican, is that if you are not a social conservative there is less and less rationale for hardened opposition to Hillary Clinton. If you’re a social conservative there’s no way you get there, if you care about that bucket of social issues,   what not, you can’t make the leap to Hillary Clinton. But if foreign policy is how you vote, if that is your central concern, if   is what worries you, how do you not consider Hillary Clinton in November?” (  Newsbusters) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
