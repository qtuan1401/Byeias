Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” while commenting on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton having to leave during the   memorial service, host Brian Stelter said, “For an hour and a half the press pool that travels with her didn’t exactly know where she was. ”  Stelter said,”Whenever there is any kind of  health scare, maybe that’s what you call this this morning, reporters are going to ask more about this. Do you think it was significant for an hour and a half the press pool that travels with her didn’t exactly know where she was?” Reporter Jeff Zeleny said, “I think that is significant, it is called the protective press pool for a reason. Once a candidate becomes a nominee of a party, both sides, there is a protective press pool around them like the president of the United States. That’s a small group of reporters, one from the broadcast network, one from the wires and one from the print organization. They in fact were, in fact, not informed as to her whereabouts. ”
