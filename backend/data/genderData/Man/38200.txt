Encompassing everything from marble statues by masters like Rodin and Michelangelo, to Alexander Calder’s hypnotic mobiles and Lynda Benglis’ organic forms    not to mention the playful Pop art characters of KAWS and Kohei Nawa’s mutated taxidermy    it’s a fairly large tent.

This is my reward.”  Look through the gallery above for works from international artists bringing out the extraordinary in everyday objects.
