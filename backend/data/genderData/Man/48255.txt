That was the   fastest pace since the last three months of 2014. ’ ”   Spending makes up   of GDP, so it’s the most important   part of the economy. According to  the higher revision was mostly due to spending on   used cars. ” ’’ ”   Strong consumer spending, which has been encouraged by a steady   supply of jobs, should continue to allay concerns about an   impending US recession. Workers’ wages in the second quarter were   revised higher. ” ’   But business spending is still concerning. ’ ’   The  showed that the economy was bogged   down by weak business spending, as company inventories shrank.   This had more of an effect than previously thought and   contributed to the small downward revision to headline GDP.   Government and construction spending also weighed on the economy   more than expected. ’ ”   Friday’s release provided the first look at corporate profits in   the second quarter and showed that they fell 1. 2% down from a   3. 4% increase in the first quarter. ” ’   Core personal consumption expenditures, a measure of inflation   that excludes volatile food and energy prices, was increased to   1. 8% from 1. 7%. ’
