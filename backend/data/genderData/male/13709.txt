The California State Auditor issued a scathing report last week alleging that University of California President and former Obama Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano raised tuitions while her office hid $175 million. [The cover page for State Auditor Elaine Howle’s   audit report states bluntly that the UC president’s office  “Failed to Disclose Tens of Millions in Surplus Funds, and Its Budget Practices Are Misleading. ”  The audit found that the UC spent $32. 5 billion on expenses during the   school year to fund 10 campuses, five medical centers, and its Office of the President headquarters. Although the UC states that its “fundamental missions are teaching, research and public service,” the UC only spent “$6. 7 billion (21 percent) on teaching, “$4. 6 billion (14 percent) on research” and “$630 million (2 percent) on public service. ” The other $20. 6 billion (63 percent) was spent on   activities. The audit highlighted criticism in January from students and lawmakers after the UC regents approved President Napolitano’s 2. 7 percent tuition increase for the   year, given that UC tuition nearly doubled from $6, 141 in 2006 —  07 to the current $12, 192 this school year. In addition, State Auditor Howle’s audit found the “Office of the President has amassed substantial reserve funds, used misleading budgeting practices, provided its employees with generous salaries and atypical benefits, and failed to satisfactorily justify its spending on systemwide initiatives. ” Howle ominously added that the “Office of the President intentionally interfered with our audit process. Auditing standards require that we disclose this interference and prohibit us from drawing valid conclusions from this portion of our work. ” Specific concerns, outlined in a cover letter to Governor Jerry Brown, include: Breitbart called the University of California’s Office of the President and left a message requesting a comment regarding the audit. No response was received.
