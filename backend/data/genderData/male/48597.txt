’  ’ ’   This past Sunday, as most of Russia focused its attention on   parliamentary elections, the country’s most popular   daily, Kommersant,  of a story that, if true, could have   consequences that last far beyond this latest round of Duma   reshuffling. ’ ’   Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to   Kommersant, is planning a major overhaul of the   country’s security services. The Russian daily reported that the   idea of the reforms is to merge the Foreign Intelligence Service,   or SVR, with the Federal Security Service, or FSB, which keeps an   eye on domestic affairs. This new supersized secret service will   be given a new name: the Ministry of State Security. ’ ’   If that sounds familiar, it should  —   this was the name given to   the most powerful and feared of Joseph Stalin’s secret services,   from 1943 to 1953. And if its combination of foreign espionage   and domestic surveillance looks familiar, well, it should: In all   but name, we are seeing a resurrection of the Committee for State   Security  —   otherwise known as the KGB. ’ ’   The KGB, it should be remembered, was not a traditional security   service in the Western sense  —   that is, an agency charged with   protecting the interests of a country and its citizens. Its   primary task was protecting the regime. Its activities included   hunting down spies and dissidents and supervising media, sports,   and even the church. It ran operations both inside and outside   the country, but in both spheres the main task was always to   protect the interests of whoever currently resided in the   Kremlin. With this new agency, we’re seeing a return to form  —     one that’s been a long time in the making. ’ ’   There was a time, not so long ago, when Russian leaders sought to   create a depoliticized security structure. When the Soviet Union   collapsed in 1991, the reform of the KGB became an immediate,   pressing issue. The agency was not reliably under control: The   chairman of the KGB at the time, Vladimir Kryuchkov, had helped   mastermind the military coup attempt aimed at overthrowing   Mikhail Gorbachev that August. But new President Boris Yeltsin   had no clear ideas about just how he wanted to reform the KGB, so   he simply decided to break it into pieces. ’ ’   The largest department of the KGB  —   initially called the Ministry   of Security; then, later, the Federal Counterintelligence Service   (FSK); then, even later, the FSB  —   was given responsibility   solely for   and counterterrorism operations. The   KGB’s former foreign intelligence directorate was transformed   into a new agency called the Foreign Intelligence Service, or   SVR. ’ ’  ’ ’   The division of the KGB responsible for electronic eavesdropping   and cryptography became the Federal Agency of Government   Communications and Information, or FAPSI. A relatively obscure   directorate of the KGB that guarded secret underground facilities   continued its functions under a new name: the Main Directorate of   Special Programs of the President, or GUSP. The KGB branch that   had been responsible for protecting Soviet leaders was renamed   the Federal Protective Service, or FSO, and the Soviet border   guards were transformed into an independent Federal Border   Service, or FPS. ’ ’   The main successor of the KGB amid this alphabet soup of changes   was the FSK. But this new counterintelligence agency was stripped   of its predecessor’s overseas intelligence functions. The agency   no longer protected Russian leaders and was deprived of its   secret bunkers, which fell under the president’s direct   authority. It maintained only a nominal presence in the army. In   its new incarnation, the agency’s mission was pruned back to   something resembling Britain’s MI5: to fight terrorism and   corruption. ’ ’   But  In a 1993   executive decree, Yeltsin lamented, reeling off a list of   acronyms for various incarnations of the security agencies, that   “the system of the        turned out to   be incapable of being reformed. Reorganization efforts in recent   years were external and cosmetic in nature.  …     The system of   political investigation is preserved and may easily be restored. ” ’ ’  ’ ’   It was a prescient comment: By the   various component   parts and functions of the old KGB had begun to make their way   back to the FSK, like the liquid metal of the killer     android inTerminator 2: Judgment Day,  after having been   blown to bits. ’ ’   First to return was the power to conduct domestic investigations.   In November 1994, Yeltsin restored the investigative directorate   of the FSK and placed the infamous Lefortovo prison, which had   once held political prisoners and had been used for   interrogations that involved torture, back under its remit. ’ ’   The next year saw a crucial name change: The FSK was rechristened   the FSB. The shift from “K” (kontrrazvedka, or   counterintelligence) to “B” (bezopasnost, or security)   was more than cosmetic; with the new name came a broad mandate   for the FSB to become the guardian of “security” for Russia. ’ ’   Over the course of the next five years, the FSB would win back   many of its old functions. It would once again be given   responsibility for pursuing dissidents, who were now branded   “extremists,” and would be given its own foreign intelligence   directorate, duplicating the SVR’s. ’ ’   When Putin came to power in 2000, he initially appeared to follow   the route laid out by his predecessor, Yeltsin. His main concern,   at least at first, seemed to be minimizing competition between   the secret services; as a result, in 2003, he allowed the FSB to   absorb responsibility for the border troops and FAPSI  —   the   electronic intelligence agency  —   and gave the service expanded   powers over the army and police. ’ ’   But the president, himself a former KGB officer, was too taken in   by KGB myths about the role of the  in Russian society to be satisfied with the   FSB being a mere security organ. He was determined to see it   become something bigger. Putin encouraged a steady growth in the   agency’s influence. The president began using the FSB as his main   recruitment base for filling key positions in government and     business; its agents were expected to define and   personify the ideology of the new Russia. ’ ’  ’ ’   When FSB Director Nikolai Patrushev, in December 2000, called his   officers Russia’s “”  —   a nickname   that agents in the KGB could have hardly dreamed of being applied   to them  —   he was taking a cue from his boss. ’ ’   By the late 2000s, it was clear that Putin had bigger changes in   store, but it wasn’t yet clear whether those changes would   elevate the FSB or destroy it. Putin began making it apparent   that he wasn’t happy with the agency’s effectiveness. In 2007, he   asked another service, an antidrug agency led by his personal   friend Viktor Cherkesov, to look into the FSB’s dealings, in the   hope, it seems, of bringing it down. ’ ’   The attack on the agency failed utterly  —   and Putin was forced to   fire his friend. Then Putin launched a new agency and gave it   enormous powers: The Investigative Committee, a sort of Russian   FBI, was tasked with conducting the most sensitive   investigations, from the murders of Kremlin critics like Anna   Politkovskaya and Boris Nemtsov to prosecuting political   activists. ’ ’   This was accompanied by an expansion of the Internal Troops  —     army units charged with operating within the country  —   and the   launch of a new Department to Counter Extremism, housed within   the Interior Ministry. Finally, this year, Putin created the   National Guard, which is a massive and       military force tasked with fighting internal dissent. ’ ’  ’ ’   Throughout the 2000s, and for much of the 2010s, it looked as if   Putin’s response to concerns about FSB ineffectiveness would be   simply to create new agencies. With this weekend’s news, that   strategy appears to have come to an abrupt end. If the   Kommersant story is true, it would mean Putin has   finally made up his mind about the fate of the FSB: It is to once   again be restored to its former glory, as the most powerful   security organ in the country by far. ’ ’   There’s some method at work here. It’s been clear for some time   that Putin is getting nervous about his political future. With   elections pending in 2018, he’s started selective repressions,   placed governors and officials in jail, and removed old friends   from key positions, in moves seemingly aimed at what his  Yuri Andropov once called   “improv[ing] labor discipline. ” ’ ’   Efforts to strengthen the security services fit within this   pattern of centralizing control; what’s new is that he’s decided   the best way to strengthen them is to merge them into one   gigantic service, with a fearsome name and a reputation that   reminds any   dissidents of the most frightening days of   the Soviet era. ’ ’   At the same time, the FSB has lost a certain something in this   transition: Gone is any talk about a “new nobility,” and the   agency is no longer being used as a recruitment base for other   sectors of the government and economy. Putin has made it clear   that what he needs is an instrument, pure and simple, to protect   his own regime  —   just like the Politburo had its instrument in   the KGB. ’ ’   Ironically, however, it seems likely that the announced reforms   will not actually improve FSB effectiveness  —   if anything,   they’ll do the opposite. ’ ’   The agency will now be forced to spend resources to eliminate   duplication (over the years, the FSB developed its own strong   foreign intelligence branch, and it’s not clear how it will merge   this with the SVR’s, for instance) to find new positions for   generals who are out of jobs, and to deal with renaming   departments, rewriting regulations, and the various other forms   of bureaucratic chaos that accompany big mergers. ’ ’   That could paralyze the new   for an undetermined   period  —   just at the time Putin needs it most. ’
