’  ’ ’   The lifeblood of modern civilization is affordable,     energy. ’ ’   It gives us the power to heat our homes. Grow and refrigerate   food. Purify water. Manufacture products. Perform organ   transplants. Drive a car. Go to work. Or procrastinate from work   by reading a story about the future of energy. ’ ”   Today’s cheap, bountiful supplies make it hard to see humanity’s   looming energy crisis, but it’s possibly coming within our   lifetimes. Our numbers will grow from    to  an increase of 22%. Rapidly developing   nations, however, will supercharge global energy consumption at   . ” ”   Fossil fuels could quench the planet’s deep thirst for energy,   but they’d be a temporary fix at best. Known reserves      within a century or two. And burning up that   fuel   would accelerate climate change, which is already on track to   disrupt and jeopardize countless lives. ” ”   Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like  though key parts of a solution, are   —   especially if the world is to meet a   2050 deadline set by the . Energy from  is  but it’s not yet proved to work, let alone on a   commercial and competitive scale. ” ”   Nuclear reactors, on the other hand, fit the bill: They’re dense,   reliable, emit no carbon, and  —   contrary to bitter popular   sentiment  —   are among the  on earth. Today, they supply about      of America’s energy, though by the 2040s, this share may drop to   10% as companies shut down   reactors, according to    released by Idaho National Laboratory   (INL). ” ’ The good news is that a proven solution   is at hand  —   if we want it badly enough. ’ ’  ’ ’   Called a  the technology was conceived during the   Cold War and forgoes solid nuclear fuel for a liquid one, which   it can ”burn” with far greater efficiency than any power   technology in existence. It also generates a small fraction of   the radioactive waste that today’’s commercial reactors  —   which   all rely on solid fuel  —   do. ’ ’   And, in theory,   reactors can never melt down. ’ ’   ”It’’s reliable, it’’s clean, it basically does everything fossil   fuel does today,” Kirk Sorensen, the chief technology officer of     startup  told Business Insider. Sorensen was speaking during    which   is produced with National Public Radio’’s ”.   ” ’ ’   ”And it does a whole bunch of things it doesn’’t do today, like   make energy without emitting carbon,” he added. ’ ’  ’ ’   What’’s more, feeding a   reactor a radioactive waste   from mining, called thorium (which is three to four times more   abundant than uranium) can ”breed” as much nuclear fuel as it   burns up. ’ ”   Manhattan Project scientist Alvin Weinberg calculated in 1959   that if we could somehow harvest all the thorium in the Earth’s   crust and use it in this way, we could power civilization for   tens of billions of years. ” ’   ”The technology is viable, the science has been demonstrated,”    a   nuclear physicist at INL, told Business Insider. ’ ”   Demonstrated, because government scientists built two   complementary prototypes during the 1950s and ’60s. ” ”   They weren’t good for making nuclear weapons, though, so   bureaucrats pulled funding for the revolutionary energy   technology. The last working   reactor shut down in   1969. ” ’   Today, entrepreneurs such as Sorensen are working tirelessly to   revive and modernize the technology. So are foreign governments   like India and China. ’ ’   China now spends more than  developing its variation of the Cold     design. ’ ’   The story of how we got here is neither short nor simple, but it   explains why Sorensen and others are betting big on humanity’’s   coming ”Thorium Age”  —   and why the US continues to stumble at its   dawn. ’ ’  ’ ’   Its brutalist architecture may not be sexy, but nuclear energy   unlocks a truly incredible source of   fuel. Ounce per   ounce, uranium  than coal and   creates millions of times less pollution. ’ ’   The argument to support growth in nuclear energy is so clear to    a   seasoned climatologist and outspoken environmentalist, that he   passionately advocates for the use and development of the   technology. ’ ’   ”To solve the climate problem, policy must be based on facts and   not on prejudice. The climate system cares about greenhouse gas   emissions  —   not about whether energy comes from renewable power   or abundant nuclear power,” Hansen and three other     scientists  —    and     —   wrote in  in 2015. ’ ’   ”Nuclear energy can power whole civilisations, and produce waste   streams that are trivial compared to the waste produced by fossil   fuel combustion,” they wrote. ”Nuclear will make the difference   between the world missing crucial climate targets or achieving   them.” ’ ’ aside, the economics of nuclear energy are   enough of a draw to make the technology worthwhile. ’ ’   Today, the industry is  albeit well subsidized. Still, if you   level the energy playing field against other power sources by   taking into account government subsidies and tax breaks, capital   costs, fuel costs, and other factors that affect the       of a power plant, nuclear energy remains   a financial win in the long run. ’ ’   Nuclear power’’s  make it about twice as cheap as natural   gas ”peaking” plants (which fire up to meet sudden peaks in   energy demand). Nuclear also beats the overall cost of many     power plants. And that’’s before you account for the    against public   health and the environment, including  (which kills tens of thousands of   people a year) and exacerbating climate change. ’ ’   Nuclear also wins financially against solar rooftops, many     energy schemes, and some geothermal and bioenergy   plants. ’ ”   That isn’t to say that current nuclear power plants are flawless.   However, they’re irrefutably amazing power sources, currently   meeting   of the US’s energy needs with just . They’re also incredibly reliable,   sources   of baseload electricity, heat, and medically useful   radioisotopes. ” ’   Yet great titans fall hard, and the reasons why are key to the   continued delay of the Thorium Age. ’ ’ ’ ”   While new reactors are planned or are coming online soon,    and the industry  with eight of the US’s 99   reactors   planned for shutdown by 2025. ” ’   What gives? ’ ’  ’ ”   Flibe Energy’s Sorensen partly blames aggressive government   subsidization of wind and solar energy, which leads to the   problem of . ” ’   ”We’’ve created rules that disturb the energy market   substantially,” Sorensen said. ”The first rule is that whenever   wind and solar come online, we have to take the power. That’’s   called grid priority. The second rules is, they’’re paid no matter   how much power they make.” ’ ’   Sorensen characterized this as the ”murder” of nuclear energy,   since those plants can’’t be shut on and off quickly. He also said   this is  by causing companies to invest more   heavily in gas plants (which can be ramped up and down quickly). ’ ’   ”These two put together create negative prices, and if you’’re a   nuclear   operator, and you’’re trying to obviously make   money selling power to the grid and the prices go negative for   large portions of the day, that’’s economically unviable,” he   said. ”That’’s what’’s causing reactors to get shut down.” ’ ’   But other issues are kneecapping nuclear too. ’ ’  ’ ’   Energy sources such as    and wind are still cheaper than nuclear, and a fracking boom has    in    power plants. ’ ’   As a result, nuclear is  finding a seat at the     table. ’ ”   Reactors also take many years and billions of dollars to permit,   build, and license for operation: They’re exceedingly large and   complex works of engineering (though you  to operate one once they’re   finished). ” ”   The average US reactor is about . They can run for decades with constant maintenance. The   Oyster Creek nuclear generating station outside of New York City,   for example, has operated since 1969. But many are being eyed for   shutdown, and once they’re shut off, reactors can take more than   a decade to decommission, demolish, and bury. ” ’   A dysfunctional uranium fuel cycle in the US has not helped,   where just 3% to 6. 5% of solid uranium fuel is burned up  —   and   the remaining 93% to 97% is treated as radioactive waste and not   reprocessed and recycled. ’ ’  ’ ’   Then there is  toward nuclear power, often amped   to . ’ ”   While events such as  and the  stand out in people’s minds, the   reality does not match up by a long shot. ” ’   ”Nuclear radiation ticks all the boxes for increasing the fear   factor,”  a statistician at Cambridge University,    after the Fukushima disaster in 2011: ’ ’   But as Spiegelhalter, Sorensen, and others have said, the actual    of nuclear power is . ’ ’   Fukushima’’s reactor meltdowns killed no one, according to   . Even in ”the two   most affected locations of Fukushima prefecture,” people in the   first year would receive only two to three CT chest scans’’ worth   of radiation exposure. ’ ’   ”Let me throw out other names you might not be familiar with: San   Bruno. Banqiao Dam,” Sorensen said, referring to the two   accidents that killed eight (in a 2010 California     explosion) and as many as  (in a series of 1975 Chinese dam collapses)   respectively. ’ ’   ”These are catastrophic incidents with hydropower and natural gas   that really did result in large losses of human life,” he said.   ”And yet the public doesn’’t have a terror of hydroelectric power   or natural gas.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Measuring immediate deaths against gigawatts of   electrical power is a typical way to assess the safety of energy   sources, and a  by   the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)   used this. ’ ’   But adding in incidental deaths that occur later, such   as 9, 000 estimated cancer fatalities from Chernobyl (which the   OECD left out) does change the numbers, as does including   pollution deaths and incidental Banqiao Dam deaths. ’ ’   In a more    comparison, . That maximum     estimates from that analysis show: ’ ’   In absolute terms, nuclear energy prevents about  a year, according to a 2013   study. Groups with antinuclear positions, such as Greenpeace,   have . ’ ’   ”Nuclear power has consistently been proven to be the safest and   most effective form of power that we have today, and by using   thorium nuclear power, we can take that admirable safety record   and go even further,” Sorensen said. ’ ”   But grasping the promise and potential perils of a     future, or any other   scheme, means   you’ve got to know a thing or two about nuclear physics. ” ’  ’ ’   In the United States, about  work in the nuclear industry, and each year   only a  an undergraduate degree in physics. ’ ”   These numbers suggest that more than 99% of us aren’t intimately   familiar with how nuclear energy works  —   so here’s a bit of   background about the atomic magic that provides roughly     of US power. ” ’   A commercial nuclear reactor’’s job, like any      plant, is to generate heat. Systems around the reactor harvest   that flow of energy, use it to boil water into steam, drive   turbines, and ultimately create electricity. Instead of burning   fossil fuels, though, nuclear reactors ”burn” heavy  typically uranium. ’ ’  ’ ”   But uranium isn’t just uranium. ” ’   The element is found as, and can be transformed into, different   isotopes, or various weights or ”flavors” of the same   atomic element: ’ ”   The larger the number, the more chargeless neutrons are jammed   into an atomic nucleus, and the heavier it is. Take away or add a   neutron, and you can radically alter an isotope’s  the  and what happens when it’s   blasted by more neutrons. ” ”   The most common isotopes of uranium aren’t very radioactive. ” ”   For half of any   to decay into lighter atoms  —   a measure   called    —   it takes 4. 6 billion years. That’s a very,   very long time to spread out a set amount of radiation.     isn’t much more radioactive with a   of 704 million   years. ” ”   Compare that to   ( ) a gas with a   of   nearly four days. It’s tens of billion times as   radioactive as   ounce for ounce, simply because     decays so much faster. (Which is why it’s a problem if it seeps   out of the ground and into your basement.) ” ”   Yet we don’t use   as a nuclear fuel. One atomic property   matters much more than all the others inside a reactor core. ” ’  ’ ’   One of the most important things about a nuclear fuel is the   chance its nucleus will react with a flying neutron, a property   called neutron cross section. ’ ’   Physicists measure cross section as an area, in ”barns,” which   you can imagine as a baseball glove. The larger the cross section   the bigger the glove, and the more likely it is to catch a   neutron  —   the baseball in this analogy. ’ ’   The speed of a neutron greatly affects what happens next, and it   can get weird. ’ ’   A neutron can scatter, get captured (and turn a nucleus into a   new isotope) or, of tremendous importance, get caught in the   glove, suddenly fission it into pieces, and spit out two   or three more baseballs in the process. ’ ”   When those extra neutrons slam into nearby isotopes and cause   them to fission, too, it’s a chain reaction. ” ’   Fission chain reactions are the key to  (and nuclear bombs) since each fission   event turns a little bit of mass into pure energy. ’ ’   However, only a handful of isotopes are fissile  —   meaning they   spit out enough neutrons and  to ”go critical” in a chain reaction. ’ ’ ’ ’    ’’s thermal cross section is about 0. 00003 barn. That is a   very tiny glove. Meanwhile,  ’’s cross section is 583 barns,   making its figurative ”glove” millions of times as big,   and a highly fissile fuel.   is also fissile with a   respectable cross section of . ’ ’   This is all gravely important. ’ ’ A controlled chain reaction is a nuclear   reactor. A runaway fission reaction is a nuclear   disaster, or a weapon of mass destruction. ’ ’   It took thousands of the world’’s brightest scientists in the   Manhattan Project many years to crack open these and deeper   mysteries of nuclear physics, then design technologies like bombs   and reactors, so we’’ll skip most of that backstory. (”” by Richard Rhodes is one of the   best books to explore that history.) ’ ’   But in addition to figuring out how to ”breed”   from     scientists learned to transmute thorium into  . ’ ’  ’ ’   If you press Sorensen for a simple analogy that illustrates how   energy from thorium works, he may plunk you down in a wet forest. ’ ’   ”If you’’ve ever gone camping as a Boy Scout or something like   that, and been caught in a rainstorm and had to start a fire, you   know that you’’re really looking hard for dry wood. Wood that will   immediately burn. That’’s kind of how some of the uranium we have   today is,” Sorensen said. ”It’’s like the dry wood. It’’s the   kindling.” ’ ’   Which makes thorium the wet wood: Get your nuclear fire hot   enough and it will burn too. ’ ’   ”That’’s an imperfect analogy, but what happens in a thorium   reactor is thorium absorbs neutrons and it forms a new fuel  —        —   that can then sustain the reaction,” he said. ”It   can produce enough neutrons to continue turning more thorium into    .” ’ ” This transformative process is called breeding, and it’s   the key that unlocks the promise of thorium  —   and explains its   eventual abandonment during the Cold War. ” ’   Manhattan Project scientists, who embraced a ”try everything”   race to the bomb, didn’’t figure out thorium breeding until late   in World War II. ’ ’   They initially focused on enriching   in natural ore from   less than 1% to about 90% which is considered . ’ ’  ’ ’   But enrichment was painfully inefficient, requiring     industrial complexes with   buildings. (All $1 billion   worth of enriched uranium went inside the ”Little Boy” bomb,   which killed  in Hiroshima.) ’ ’   Plutonium, an element not found in nature  —   and specifically the   isotope    —   eventually changed everything, since it was a   simpler (though still arduous) path to nuclear weapons. ’ ’   The highly fissile isotope could be ”bred” from common   by   pounding it with neutrons, then chemically removing the fresh     with a bath of   —     no   buildings full of machinery required. ’ ’   But in tandem, the Manhattan Project also explored making a third   fissile material,   from thorium. ’ ’  ’ ’   Glenn Seaborg, who  ”may have seen   as a backup   plan to the plutonium effort,” Sorensen wrote in  about early research   into thorium. ’ ’   The scheme involved fueling up a reactor, then using the neutrons   to bombard thorium  —   and breeding it into  . ’ ’   But   quickly became a dead end for the military. ’ ’   For one,   and   were precious   materials, so   burning them up in reactors was risky. Breeding   from   thorium also created significant amounts of a worrisome   contaminant called   which scientists had not yet   figured out how to remove. ’ ”     emits a lot of alpha radiation, which can trigger   spontaneous fission  —   not good for a nuclear weapon you don’t   want to randomly explode. Its decay products also  which can wreck electronics and harm or kill   people who handle bombs. In addition, gamma rays can blow a   bomb’s cover, since they are detectable by airplane or satellite,   and pass through all but the heaviest radiation shielding. ” ’  ’ ’   Scientists like Seaborg weren’’t even certain a    bomb   would blow up very well. Apparently, they were right: A 1955   ”” weapons test using   fizzled (the US government   has yet to declassify all the details, though). ’ ’   So in 1945, with   production firmly in place, confidence in   that weapons material, and a looming Japanese surrender, the   defenders of breeding thorium into   ”went to zero,” Sorensen   told Business Insider. ’ ’   ”Was that the right decision? It’’s very hard to know,” Sorensen   said. ”Those people thought that they were making a decision to   preserve the future for their children [. ..] So I hesitate to   levy judgments on those decisions made in the past.” ’ ’   But in the years leading up to the war’’s end, Manhattan Project   scientists were dreaming up ways to turn their wartime research   into commercial power sources, and one group arrived at a   brilliant concept: a    ”breeder” reactor that   ran on thorium and  . ’ ’  ’ ’   The concept of the breeder reactor was fairly straightforward. ’ ’   It would dramatically increase the chances for fission, boost the   flow of neutrons, and breed more fissile fuel from a ”fertile”   material than the reactor burned up. Breeding   into     created an excess of plutonium. Meanwhile, breeding thorium into     broke even, burning up just as much fuel as it made. ’ ’   The choice of fuel makes all the difference. ’ ’   The plutonium fuel cycle is a great way to make weapons.   Meanwhile, the thorium fuel cycle can produce almost limitless   energy. ’ ’   A   design was ultimately envisioned by Manhattan   Project scientists to ”eliminate the considerable difficulty of   fabricating solid fueled elements,” Sorensen wrote in his thesis.   Liquid fuel also made it easy to remove both useful fission   products  —   for example, for medical procedures, and those that   poison nuclear chain reactions. The gas   ( ) is a   common uranium fission product, and its      cross section gobbles up neutrons and chokes reactors. ’ ’   Physicist Alvin Weinberg later wrote the idea to use fluid fuels   ”” of his, to the extent he eventually succeeded   at building his first   reactors in Tennessee. ’ ’  ’ ’   When the Air Force launched an effort to build a     bomber in 1947  —   part of the   —   Weinberg, who in   1945    reactor (LWR) rose to   the occasion. ’ ’   But Weinberg, then the director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory   (ORNL) thought LWRs were too heavy and inefficient for a jet   airplane. ’ ’   In fact, even modern LWRs  —   which all US commercial nuclear power   plants operate today  —   fission or ”burn up” just a few percent of   their fuel before it needs to be replaced. That’’s because     waste builds up in the fuel, can’’t be removed,   and chokes fission. ’ ’   ”When you go to gas station, do you feel good about burning 10%   of it? What about 5%?” Sorensen said, referencing the low     rate of   commercial reactors. ”You want to burn it   all. Why should we expect anything different?” ’ ’   A   reactor emerged as the clear choice, since it could   be built small: The fluid dramatically increases the efficiency   of nuclear fission by making it easy to remove fission products,   helping it burn up almost all the nuclear fuel and boosting   energy output. ’ ’  ’ ”   By 1954, Weinberg’s team had built the    Aircraft   Reactor Experiment (ARE) a 2.  power plant that ran on   a small amount of   dissolved in molten salt made of   fluorine, sodium, and zirconium. ” ’ It was the first working   reactor ever   built. ’ ”   Dissolved inside the reactor’s molten salt,   fuel powered a   fission chain reaction. The atomic heat warmed up an adjacent   loop of coolant (filled with molten sodium) by 300 degrees,   . Incoming air cooled the   sodium, and pumps returned it to the   reactor core   for reheating. ” ’   ”The Air Force was delighted by the aircraft reactor experiment,”   Weinberg  in his 1994 autobiography, ”,” since this was hot enough to drive     turbines. ’ ’   Weinberg’’s new technology never made it inside the ”The Crusader”   nuclear   bomber (which actually ) before President John F.   Kennedy canceled the entire USAF project in 1961. ’ ”   However, Weinberg had squeezed years’ worth of research on     reactors out of the effort by then  —   and wasted no   time spinning his work into the   Reactor Experiment   (MSRE). ” ’  ’ ’   Weinberg and his colleagues designed MSRE over five years as a   prototype for a commercial power plant. ’ ”   It contained a loop filled with a molten salt made of fluorine,   lithium, and beryllium  —   or FLiBe, the namesake of Sorensen’s     —   plus zirconium. The salt carried around dissolved     and eventually   making MSRE the world’s first reactor   to run on   fuel. A second loop of molten salt cooled the   reactor. ” ’  ’ ’   The reactor  ran for thousands of hours with only minor   issues, and was put into standby mode after its first run ended   in 1969. Weinberg thought of MSRE as a    and he   planned to develop it into a full molten salt breeder reactor   (MSBR). ’ ’   This new version would blanket the   core with   thorium dissolved in, transforming the element into  .   Systems would then filter out that new fuel and feed it into the   core  —   all without having to shut down the reactor. ’ ’   He also envisioned a world flush with thorium   breeder   reactors as cheap, clean energy sources not only for the US but   also for the developing world. ’ ’   According to ”,”   a 2013 book on thorium energy’’s demise and promise by journalist   and author Richard Martin: ’ ’   But it was not to be. ’ ’  ’ ”   Martin argues that a stubborn naval engineer named Milton Shaw   derailed Weinberg’s Thorium Age indefinitely. ” ”   Shaw led the Atomic Energy Commission’s research wing during   Weinberg’s tenure at ORNL, and in 1972, Shaw issued a rambling   report that terminated Weinberg’s project. Shaw then diverted the   funding to the liquid metal fast breeder reactor  —   a     design that  but never actually built a reactor. ” ’   In ”SuperFuel,” Martin exposes Shaw’’s rickety argument for   killing the MSRE, a point that forms his book’’s central argument   (his emphasis): ’ ”   Martin then argues similar thinking has stuck with the US   government ever since Shaw’s letter (his emphasis): ” ’   Weinberg was quickly pushed out of ORNL and into retirement. His     reactors never demonstrated the full thorium fuel   cycle  —   breeding thorium into    —   but another project did. ’ ”   Situated in western Pennsylvania and spearheaded by Shaw’s boss,   Navy Admiral Hyman Rickover, the Shippingport Atomic Power   Station pulled off the feat, yet inside a   LWR (one   that helped pioneer the development of the first     submarine). ” ”   Martin succinctly describes Shippingport’s success in his book: ” ”   Sorensen and other entrepreneurs would discover this history   decades later and attempt to revive Weinberg’s dream. ” ’  ’ ”   Sorensen first learned of   reactors in 2000, when he   was an engineer at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. His task   at the time was to figure out how to power human bases on other   worlds. ” ’   As Martin describes the moment in his  Sorensen saw a 1958 book called ”Fluid Fuel Reactors”   on the shelf of a colleague. The book laid out the lessons of   Weinberg’’s   reactor experiments for ANP, and teased   his vision of a   future. ’ ’ ’ ’   He ultimately left NASA to join a   company, then   struck out on his own to chase the thorium dream with Flibe   Energy. ’ ’   ”For the longest time I thought that good ideas always got   developed,” Sorensen said. ”I’’ve learned that the opposite is   actually true. Most of the time, good ideas languish. And only   through dedicated and committed effort are you able to see a new   technology brought to fruition.” ’ ”   In the next decade or so, several safer, more efficient  may hit the market.   Sorensen puts them into two groups:   reactors that   don’t use thorium or   technologies that   could, but are comparatively minor (and therefore     ) upgrades to the LWR design. ” ’   Sorensen is a proponent of a third group and the one he’’s staking   his career on: the   thorium reactor, or  (an   acronym pronounced ”lifter”). ’ ’  ’ ”   The LFTR is Sorensen’s own spin on Weinberg’s thorium breeder   reactor work from the 1960s. ” ’   A  by the Electric   Power Research Institute deemed it a ”potentially   transformational technology for meeting future energy needs in   the face of uncertain market, policy, and regulatory   constraints.” ’ ”   Here’s part of the laundry list of reasons why Sorensen  say that’s the case: ” ’   The list goes on. ’ ”   With these and other benefits, it’s easy to get excited about   LFTRs, other   reactors, and even   LWRs. ” ’   But it all raises the question. .. ’ ’  ’ ’   It basically boils down to this: ”The science is easy. The   engineering is hard.” ’ ”   That’s the verdict from Gougar and his colleague at INL, nuclear   engineer . ” ’   ”This is true in many, many advanced systems, nuclear and   nonnuclear for that matter, where the scientists’’ proof of   concept is everything to them,” Petti told Business Insider. ”To   the engineer, getting it to the   stage is   their goal. And those are two very different hills to climb. ” ’ ’   Petti sees three barriers to powering civilization with   commercial thorium LFTRs. ’ ’   LFTR’’s molten salt contains beryllium to help regulate nuclear   fission, but it’’s a big health hazard. If there’’s ever a leak or   spill of the material, Petti says it solidifies into a crumbly   ”snow” that workers might inhale, raising their risk of a    and a disease called . ’ ”   Molten salt also contains lithium, which a reactor can breed into   a . It’s less of a threat than beryllium, but   it can bond to water and make it slightly radioactive, possibly   leading to cancer and birth defects. Luckily, such tainted water   doesn’t stick around in the body, which flushes out half of any   amount within 10 days, according to . ” ’   Dave Swank, a retired nuclear engineer who worked with commercial   reactors for more than 35 years, emailed Business Insider to   point out other hazards of molten salts. ’ ’   ”Salts can be very harmful to metal piping (think of salt used on   the road and what it does to car bodies),” Swank wrote. ”Another   challenge is the use of [fluorine] which is highly toxic due to   its strong ability to strip electrons.” ’ ’     ’ ’   But good engineering, proper safety protocols, and protective   equipment for LFTR staff would minimize these and other risks. ’ ’   The second barrier is the most exhausting but, Petti says, not   insurmountable  —   especially if you have a billionaire in your   back pocket. ’ ’   ”You have to demonstrate the technology works, scale it up, and   make sure it’’s reliable for the commercial product,” Petti said.   ”And it takes a lot of time and a lot of money to get the   technology from a proof of concept all the way to a commercial   endeavor.” ’ ’  ’ ”   Petti said the LFTR’s big bugaboo is its proliferation risk,   since   fuel could be used to make a nuclear weapon. ” ’   Fortunately,   contamination  —   by highly radioactive     as previously noted  —   is a good deterrent, since the   isotope quickly decays into   which shoots out deadly   (and   ) gamma radiation. ’ ’   Still, there is a way to greatly reduce this danger: an   intermediate step between thorium and   called     ( ). This makes it possible to filter out     and, months later, get a relatively pure and minimally   contaminated lump of  . ’ ’   ”When we talk to the nonproliferation experts, the safeguard   issues are huge,” Petti said. ”Being able to prove that you can’’t   do something nefarious has a big impact on the design.” ’ ’   Gougar added: ”It’’s not that NSA doesn’’t trust Kirk [Sorensen].   It’’s Iran or North Korea.” ’ ”   That’s not to say it’d be easy. ” ’   First, it may take a large and easily visible     process to cleanse enough stolen   to make a bomb, which   minimizes the threat of terrorism. Also, at least as envisioned   by Sorensen, the LFTR concept is a   system  —   so   getting access to the liquid fuel and siphoning off materials   would be exceedingly difficult. ’ ’  ’ ”   Then again, for a nation like North Korea, stealing material from   a US reactor is not the concern. Rather, it’s a theft of the   blueprints for one, then adapting that design to operate as a   powerful new source of   nuclear material. ” ’   That security concern may also be a moot point, however, since   both China and India are already working on developing the   technology, and aggressively so. ’ ”   Given that scenario, it might be better to create and license   LFTRs in a highly regulated environment (like the US) so that   nonproliferation safeguards are built into the design long before   it’s exported (or stolen) and adopted. ” ’   LFTR advocates also point out that many nations can already   create and refine fissile   and   with traditional LWRs. ’ ’  ’ ’   Addressing all of the niggling details, according to current   government estimates, might take until 2050 to fully realize a   commercial LFTR or other type of thorium   breeder   reactor. ’ ’   Similarly arduous timescales are true of other ”generation four”   nuclear reactors, which is why they, too, aren’’t yet powering US   homes and businesses. ’ ’   ”Maneuvering the licensing process is a huge challenge. The   regulatory framework is not currently streamlined to support   these novel innovative technologies,”  a materials engineer at INL, told Business   Insider. ’ ’       companies aren’’t interested in   overturning decades of ”business as usual” to gamble on a   technology that’’s radically different from anything in their   portfolios. After all, the LFTR may work but end up being   outcompeted on price for the energy it generates. ’ ’   So instead, most companies are riffing on current LWR and related   designs to improve efficiency, safety, and the tortuously slow   speed of licensing a reactor. ’ ’   ”To their credit, though, the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]   recognizes this and is working with the [Department of Energy] to   improve the licensing process as well, while keeping its mission   at the forefront: the safety of the public,” Baranwal said. ’ ’  ’ ”   Baranwal is also trying to help companies advance more disruptive   designs. After 11 years working in the   industry,   she left in August 2016 to be the founding director of INL’s new    (GAIN) program. ” ” a   nuclear scientist at the University of California at Berkeley,   likened GAIN to NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services    —   a program that helps commercial spaceflight startups like   SpaceX get going. ” ’   ”You can look at a large company like [United Launch Alliance]   and compare its capability to develop rocket designs with SpaceX.   The big, incumbent nuclear firms face issues around technological    . And they can’’t avoid it because of the scale they have   to work and operate,” said Peterson, who is also on Flibe   Energy’’s board of advisors. ’ ’   ”I think there’’s real potential for   businesses,” he   said. ”It’’s like with biotechnology: a small company will get a   drug through phase two or three trials, then large pharmaceutical   companies pick it up.” ’ ”   Even if a small demonstration LFTR works, it isn’t guaranteed to   scale up. Some unforeseen design issues may rear their ugly   heads. And there are two other things that Baranwal, Gougar,   Petti, and others can’t help with: market forces and people. ” ”   LFTR could be a   slam dunk for commercial power, but   antinuclear (or anticompetitive) interests could threaten its   future. And if the technology can’t compete with natural gas,   wind, solar, hydroelectric, legacy nuclear power plants, and   more, it could just be a failed business venture  —   Weinberg’s     metropolises be damned. ” ”   That doesn’t mean it’s not worth trying: The stakes will only get   higher as we use up fossil fuels and humanity’s numbers grow. ” ’   And as for Sorensen, the LFTR is certainly a dream worth chasing. ’ ’   ”This is something that’’s going to benefit their future   tremendously; it’’s going to lead to a new age of human success,”   he said, speaking to readers. ”And if they want that, they need   to be talking to their elected officials and demanding it, in   fact, and saying ’’we want to see these things happen. ’’ Because   only a society that decides to embrace this kind of technology is   going to ultimately realize its benefits.” ’ ’  For more on   reactors and solving climate   change, listen to the ”world building”  of the ”” podcast from   Business Insider and Marketplace.
