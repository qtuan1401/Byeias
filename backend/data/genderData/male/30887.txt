Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Gov. Scott Walker ( ) criticized Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her remarks a day earlier at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania declaring that the unrest in Milwaukee over the weekend demonstrated a need for law enforcement to “rebuild trust” with the communities it protects.  “I think comments like that are just inflaming the situation,” Walker said. “I think people understand in that neighborhood, in Sherman Park and Milwaukee, they want the law enforcement to step up and protect them. The people who live in that neighborhood want police in Milwaukee and the sheriff’s department to step up and protect them. They don’t want the the criminals who are doing those actions against those businesses to do that. And I think statements like that and the lack of leadership we’ve had from the president on this issue only inflames the situation. ” (  Business Insider) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
