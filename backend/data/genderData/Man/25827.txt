Clinton Cash author and Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer writes: “Why did Hillary’s State Department urge U. S. investors to fund Russian research for military uses?”  Hillary Clinton touts her tenure as secretary of state as a time of hardheaded realism and “commercial diplomacy” that advanced American national and commercial interests. But her handling of a major technology transfer initiative at the heart of Washington’s effort to “reset” relations with Russia raises serious questions about her record. Far from enhancing American national interests, Mrs. Clinton’s efforts in this area may have substantially undermined U. S. national security. Consider Skolkovo, an “innovation city” of 30, 000 people on the outskirts of Moscow, billed as Russia’s version of Silicon Valley —  and a core piece of Mrs. Clinton’s quarterbacking of the Russian reset. Following his 2009 visit to Moscow, President Obama announced the creation of the U. S.  Bilateral Presidential Commission. Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state directed the American side, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov represented the Russians. The stated goal at the time: “identifying areas of cooperation and pursuing joint projects and actions that strengthen strategic stability, international security, economic   and the development of ties between the Russian and American people. ” The Kremlin committed $5 billion over three years to fund Skolkovo. Mrs. Clinton’s State Department worked aggressively to attract U. S. investment partners and helped the Russian State Investment Fund, Rusnano, identify American tech companies worthy of Russian investment. Rusnano, which a scientific adviser to President Vladimir Putincalled “Putin’s child,” was created in 2007 and relies entirely on Russian state funding. What could possibly go wrong?
