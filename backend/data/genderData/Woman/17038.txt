Stephen A. Smith reacted Monday on ESPN2’s “First Take” to San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sitting during the national anthem in order to protest the oppression of black people, and the ESPN host said Kaepernick is bringing attention to the fact that most   feel they are still living in a “racist society” today.  “What it brings us back to is a reality that a lot of folks in America do not want to accept,” Smith said. “We have come a long way. We are better today than we were 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 40, 50 years ago, but that does not negate the fact that in the eyes of a vast majority of   in this country this is still a racist society. It is still a racist environment that black people are subjected to every single day, per capita income, education, et cetera, et cetera. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
