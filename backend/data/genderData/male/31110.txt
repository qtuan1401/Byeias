GOP presidential candidate Sen. Rick Santorum  —   the 2012 Iowa caucus winner  —   engaged more than 300   Hawkeye state voters at the Speak for Life benefit in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Friday  —   just three days before the Iowa caucus. [“We are under assault in this country, an assault on religious liberties, the ability to speak in public,” Santorum told the crowd. “We have a decreasing acceptance of any faith being expressed. We need to have courage to fight and fight for all truths. We are accepting what we don’t have to accept. ”  “Be not afraid to go out there and stand for the truth,” he encouraged the audience. “There were over 300 strong   Iowans,” Santorum’s spokesman Matt Beynon told Breitbart News. “He was the only candidate, and the reception was amazing and encouraging. ” The annual Speak for Life dinner is reportedly aimed at promoting the “culture of life. ”
