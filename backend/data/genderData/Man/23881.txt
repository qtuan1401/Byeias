On January 7 President Obama will hold a live gun control town hall on CNN with Anderson Cooper. [The town hall will take place three days after Obama meets with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to finalize executive gun controls which are expected to be announced in the coming days.  According to CNN, the Obama town hall will feature gun control commentary from President Obama as well as “questions from the audience on the issue” of gun control. The town hall comes one day before “the fifth anniversary  …    of the shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords ( ),” who was shot by Jared Loughner after Loughner passed a background check for his gun, then used that gun to kill six and wound 13 others. Obama’s pending executive gun controls are expected to expand background checks to cover private gun sellers and to place more reporting requirements on federally licensed gun dealers. Neither of these actions would have prevented Giffords’ attacker from acquiring his gun or carrying out his attack. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
