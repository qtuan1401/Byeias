Democratic pollster and analyst Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow on Friday, “The big secret that no one knows is that many of these large corporations operate out of a sense of fear, whether they’re being terrorized by a Jesse Jackson, or ACORN, or whatever. ” He was referring to how Kellogg’s recently caved to a   campaign to pull its advertising from Breitbart News. [“They succumb to a conventional wisdom of the elites, and they are the first to cave on everything,” said Caddell, adding, “One of the reasons we have this disconnect politically and economically in this country is because the people who are supposed to care about free enterprise are not in the business of free enterprise. They’re in the business of crony capitalism. They’re in the business of sucking up to government. ”  He went on to call Kellogg’s statements about the growing controversy “unbelievable. ” Said Caddell, “I was kicking myself because last week, I bought Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes for my granddaughter to have in my house, and now I’m kicking myself. I should have gotten another brand. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
