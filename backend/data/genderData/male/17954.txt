Businessman and Republican candidate for Wisconsin’s First Congressional District in Tuesday’s primary, Paul Nehlen, told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon that “people like Paul Ryan have hijacked this great country of ours from us” and that there is a “movement building” to take the country back, one driven by “people getting lied to over and over again” by our elected officials in Washington. [Nehlen also urged people to get involved in voter outreach via his website, saying, “There’s still time for people to sign up on our website and get on our phone bank,” in an effort to continue to grow name recognition for the candidate, heading into Tuesday’s primary.  “You would not believe the people that I’ve talked to   …     who have said, ‘I’m inspired by what you’re doing,’” said Nehlen, “I was just talking to a guy in Janesville who said he’s going to run for city council. I talked to a guy in Racine last night he’s going to run. This is absolutely igniting exactly what we wanted: our country back. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
