Bangkok (CNN) The Thai King, Bhumibol Adulyadej, is in an ”unstable” condition in hospital after undergoing several medical procedures over the weekend, a palace statement says. The    the world’s   monarch, is now being closely monitored. On Saturday, doctors at the Siriraj hospital in Bangkok inserted a tube into his vein to enable kidney dialysis to filter the blood    known as hemodialysis.  The team also changed a draining tube which releases fluid from his brain. Following the procedures, the King’s blood pressure ”dropped occasionally” and he was given medicine and put on a ventilator. On Sunday, the doctors gave the King medicine to expand blood vessels around his lungs following an echocardiography    a sonogram of the heart    which showed that blood flow to the left side of his heart had reduced significantly.  His blood pressure then ”improved,” but his general condition ”remains unstable,” according to the statement from the Bureau of the Royal Household, posted on the King’s official Facebook page. Concerns for the   King have been mounting in recent years, due to his extended hospital stays.  Last month, he was treated for a severe infection, reduced kidney function and fluid in his lung. He had surgery to remove his gallbladder last year.
