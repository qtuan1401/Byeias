Wednesday on CNN’s “Wolf’,” Democratic National Committee chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) was asked about voter turnout on the Democratic side going down  while the Republicans are coming out to vote in record numbers.  She said, “Let’s not set aside the absolute and utter chaos that’s going on in the Republican Party. ” Partial transcript as follows: BLITZER: “What does that say to you about the state of the Democratic Party, that there seems to have been, based on the turnout, hundreds of thousands of more record turnouts for the Republican candidates showing up as opposed to the Democratic candidates. ” WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: “First of all, let’s not set aside the absolute and utter chaos that’s going on in the Republican Party. They are in full blown panic mode, when it comes to the turnout, though, I mean we had nearly as many voters turnout in the early primary state window has as the Republicans did with for fewer candidates. Even last night, Wolf, with Colorado, the Republicans are in such disarray and it’s so chaotic there, that in Colorado, the Republican Party cancelled their caucus. So the only delegates going to the convention from Colorado on the Republican side are super delegates. That’s how much disarray is going on the Republican side. We had more voters in Nevada in our caucus than they had in theirs. And then if you look at the states in which there was a less competitive contest between our two candidates on our side, that’s where the turnout dropped and where there was a more competitive contest in those states, we had nearly the turnout that Republicans did. So we’re very, very pleased with our turnout and are confident that we’re going to have success in November as a result. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
