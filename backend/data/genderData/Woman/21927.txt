Taylor Swift has had a change of heart about Apple Music. [In a new ad for the company released Friday, the    pop superstar takes a nasty spill on a treadmill while working out with the aid of the tech giant’s Music app.  WATCH: “Man, I hate cardio,” Swift thinks to herself as she pops in headphones before her workout. The “Wildest Dreams” singer puts on Drake and Future’s hit song “Jumpman” and begins to sing along with the lyrics while she runs: “Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something. ” Swift is into it, hands swinging wildly while she raps along with the song and then seconds later, takes a     onto the treadmill while still managing not to miss a beat with the lyrics. Cue title card: “Distractingly good. ” Few would have thought just last year that Swift would ever cut an ad for Apple Music. In June, the singer took to Tumblr to blast the company for its refusal to pay artists during its   Music service’s   free trial period. “I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service,” Swift wrote then. “I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company. ” The company changed its policy just 12 hours after Swift’s Tumblr post went viral, and Swift allowed her    record 1989 to be streamed on the service shortly thereafter.
