Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” when asked about a potential Hillary Clinton administration pursing the   Partnership (TPP) trade agreement after the election if they win, Democratic   nominee Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) said, “You never close the door.’  Partial transcript as follows: TODD: After the election, President Obama will travel overseas, probably talking up the idea of TPP and an Asian trade agreement. if you guys are elected, will you pursue an Asian trade agreement, even if it’s not the TPP? KAINE: Hillary and I haven’t talk about that question directly. We aren’t against trade. We want to find export markets for American businesses because they will be able to add workers the more they export. That’s very important. And whether it’s in Asia or Europe, if we can find deals that meet those goals, more jobs, higher wages and good for national security and good enforcement provisions, we’re open to them. So, no, you never close the door if you can get a deal that’s good for American workers and our economy. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
