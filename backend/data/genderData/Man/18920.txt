LANGUAGE WARNING]  An Iowa woman live streamed herself on Facebook earlier this month berating police officers at a cafe just days after two Des Moines officers were shot and killed while sitting in their squad cars, WHOTV reports. The woman, Melyssa Jo Kelly, was in Cedar Rapids’ Brewhemia cafe mocking the female officer standing in front of her for wearing a black band around her badge to honor the two recently fallen officers, saying the officer did not care about the man shot by her “vicious thug brothers in blue. ” “She doesn’t give a s**t about the man who is in critical care at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics with a bullet in his neck from one of the wonderful and vicious thug brothers in blue,” said Kelly on the stream, referencing the shooting of    Jerime Mitchell during a traffic stop altercation. Kelly had been asked earlier by the cafe’s owners to leave the cafe, but she refused. When one of the police officers was done speaking with the owners, he asked Kelly to leave, but she proceeded to harass the officer instead. He gave Kelly a verbal trespass warning on camera. “Don’t pretend like you serve and protect, you b***h  …     out of my way, popo,” she said. The woman finally left the cafe, but not without causing an even bigger scene by yelling at the officers to get their hands off her. WHOTV found that court records show a    Melyssa Jo Kelly has been ordered to pay fines in Iowa for at least four counts of disorderly conduct, two counts of interference with official acts and one count of trespass.
