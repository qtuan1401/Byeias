On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Wolf,” Representative Tim Ryan ( ) who is supporting Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reacted to FBI Director James Comey’s announcement that the agency is taking a new look at Clinton’s emails by asking, “where did these documents come from? How did they get to the FBI? Is Russia involved in this? We don’t have any clue of where this stuff is coming from. ”  Ryan asked, “Where have these documents, where did they come from? How did the FBI get to them? How  —   where are they? We have all this stuff going on with Russia right now. All of the WikiLeaks issues of stolen documents, that we don’t really even know if some have been manipulated or not manipulated. Why didn’t the FBI have these documents through all of the different investigations that they went through on this, where the FBI said that, you know, she didn’t do anything wrong? That, maybe careless, but that was it, and that there would have had to have been this huge conspiracy of 300 people in the State Department that would have been conspiring to, you know, release confidential information. Why didn’t it come up in all of this? Hillary Clinton has been thoroughly vetted on this issue. The FBI chose not to do anything with the information, and we have all moved on. So the question is, where did these documents come from? How did they get to the FBI? Is Russia involved in this? We don’t have any clue of where this stuff is coming from. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
