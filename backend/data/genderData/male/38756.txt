 (CNN) What happens when you submerge a black dress in the depths of the Dead Sea? A lot, it turns out.  In her   ”Salt Bride” photography series, now on view at Marlborough Contemporary in London, Israeli artist Sigalit Landau documents the incredible transformation, as more and more salt crystals adhere to the fabric over the course of three months in 2014.  ”It looks like snow, like sugar, like death’s embrace,” Landau said of the salt deposits in a statement.

Symbolically, Landau transforms the garment from a mourning dress to gown of celebration.  Landau also created ”Small Salt Bride”    a bridesmaid dress    as a separate sculpture.  10 stunning vintage photos entirely underwater, Return to the Sea  ”Salt Bride” isn’t the first time Landau has drawn inspiration from the Dead Sea.
