 (CNN) David Gandy is best known for his ubiquitous Dolce  Gabbana campaigns, endless magazine covers and sophisticated personal style.  But the supermodel    who was the second highest paid male model of 2016    is also a proud petrolhead, with an enviable collection that includes   from Mercedes, Porsche and the British brand Jaguar.  The latter should come as no surprise. An ambassador for London’s menswear fashion week (which opens today) and household name across the United Kingdom, Gandy has positioned himself as an authority and advocate for a certain type of British cool.  ”I love everything British classic,” Gandy told CNN Style show host Derek Blasberg. ”It’s why I’ve always supported heritage brands (and) supported Savile Row, where, basically, a   suit was invented. And Jaguar virtually invented the   sportscar.”  Like most car enthusiasts, Gandy was intrigued when the marque revealed last spring that it would be resurrecting its XKSS supercar    the   Le     beloved by Steve McQueen.  Read: Behind Bentley’s   turnaround, Jaguar had meant to build 25 of the XKSS in the 1950s, but nine of the original run were destroyed in a 1957 fire.  The new cars    called ”continuation” models    have been built to the same specifications of the originals. All nine have already sold (reportedly for more than $1 million each) but Gandy was given the     to opportunity to drive one himself ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show last November.  Watch the video above to find out more about the rebirth of the Jaguar XKSS and Gandy’s   love of cars.
