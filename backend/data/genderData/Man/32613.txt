Propofol, also called Diprivan, is a short acting intravenous anesthetic used to put patients to sleep during hospital procedures. It is not intended for home use, because of the usual lack of equipment required for emergency resuscitation. Murray told detectives that he was treating Jackson for insomnia by giving him 50 mg of propofol, via an intravenous drip, each night, but lowered the dosage to 25 mg and combined it with other drugs in an attempt to wean Jackson off the propofol.
