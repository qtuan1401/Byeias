Friday on MSNBC’s “MTP Daily,” host Chuck Todd reported on the latest developments in regard to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s email scandal that has resulted in an FBI investigation into the former secretary of state’s handling of classified materiel during her tenure.  Todd said, “Just under 72 hours before the first doors open at the Iowa caucuses, and we seem to have a potential January surprise on our hands. What has been the routine monthly release of Hillary Clinton’s State Department   has a bit of a   headline today. The State Department says that 22 emails from seven different email chains will be withheld from public release at the request of U. S. intelligence officials, because they contain   information. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
