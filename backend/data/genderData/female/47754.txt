’  ’ ”   Investor Karim Faris loves Silicon Valley, but when he’s looking   for deals, he’s a big fan of escaping it, too.  ” ’   A  (formerly Google Ventures)   Faris makes a  ’ ’   ”I’’m a fan of emerging ecosystems that are not in the Valley  —     other areas where the talent pools are unbelievable,”   he tells Business Insider. ”Where it just feels like you can be a   lot more thoughtful recruiting, where there’’s no frenzy. I like   going and looking for entrepreneurs in those pockets.” ’ ’   Faris has funded startups in Atlanta, Georgia (FullStory, Ionic   Security) Ann Arbor, Michigan (Duo) Portland, Oregon (Puppet)   and Austin (RetailMeNot) and has built up connections in those   cities and others.  ’ ’   ”IEach ecosystem thinks in different ways. They have   expertise in certain domains that others aren’’t as strong in.   It’’s so fascinating to learn from.” ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’The best way to find these companies is actually to   go there. It takes work and the willingness to fly over   on a regular basis to discover, learn the ecosystem, and make the   connections. Some [startups] do come to Boston or Silicon Valley   to look for investors, but I think the right way to do it is   just to build connections by going there personally.” ’ ’   His trick: Prepare to alternate board meeting locations or try   out teleconferencing.  ’ ’   Google cofounder Sergey Brin actually made a similar   statement recently, advising wannabe entrepreneurs to  ’ ’   ”During the boom cycles, the expectations around the costs  —   real   estate, salaries  —   the expectations people and employees have . ..   it can be hard to make a scrappy initial business that’’s   ” he said. ”Whereas in other parts of the world   you might have an easier time for that.” ’ ”   Although Brin did say that Silicon Valley is better for   raising more capital, Faris proves that it doesn’t have to be a   necessity.  ”
