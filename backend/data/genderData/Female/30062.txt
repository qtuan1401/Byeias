Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson alleged that there is a “culture” within fellow candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s campaign that led some of his supporters to falsely claim Carson had dropped out during the Iowa caucus on Tuesday’s “O’Reilly Factor” on the Fox News Channel.  Carson said that he talked to Cruz “And he says that he didn’t know anything about what the campaign did. ” And that, “I have to accept at his word that he didn’t know, because he said if he had known, he would have not agreed with such a thing. ” He latter added, “A culture exists within the Cruz camp that would allow people to take advantage of a situation like this in a very dishonest way. Isn’t this the same thing that we see with the Obama administration, the IRS scandal? No responsibility. Let’s see, what, in fact, the Cruz campaign will do about those individuals who inappropriately disseminated this information, knowing that the caucus were not over. They were awfully anxious to get it out there, weren’t they?” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
