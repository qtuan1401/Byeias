Former Subway pitchman and convicted pedophile Jared Fogle was reportedly left bloodied and bruised after getting assaulted in the recreation yard of the prison where he is currently serving a   sentence. [According to TMZ, Fogle, 38, was attacked by Steven Nigg, 60, in the yard of the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood, Colorado, on January 29.  Fogle reportedly sustained a bloody nose, scratches on his neck, and a swollen face during the fight. TMZ reports that Nigg tackled Fogle to the ground and began punching him in the face repeatedly. Nigg, who is serving time at the facility on a weapons charge, was placed in solitary confinement as punishment. A member of Niggâ€™s family told TMZ that the inmate was upset at how many sex offenders are housed in the prison. Fogle pleaded guilty in 2015 to one count of distribution and receipt of child pornography and one count of traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor. In November, he was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison.
