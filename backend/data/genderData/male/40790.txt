 (CNN) The Transportation Security Administration allowed an individual who was a convicted felon and former member of a domestic terror group through TSA   at a U. S. airport last summer, according to a new government watchdog report.   A Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report said the traveler had convictions for murder and offenses that involved explosives. The report says the June 29th, 2014, incident created a ”significant aviation security breach.”  READ: United flight turns back after passenger tackles man, The report was prompted by a whistleblower, according to a statement on the report by the DHS office of Inspector General. ”After checking the traveler’s boarding pass and identification, an alert Transportation Security officer at the airport recognized the felon and alerted his supervisor,” said the DHS watchdog. ”However, the supervisor directed the [officer] to take no action and allow the traveler to continue through the TSA   lane.” DHS Inspector General John Roth said reducing vulnerabilities is a key component of air travel security. ”Incidents like this highlight the need for TSA to modify their   procedures,” he said in the statement.   The TSA said it continues to improve security and use ”best practices.” ”All passengers, including those with TSA   on boarding passes, are subject to a robust security approach that employs multiple layers of security, both seen and unseen. Together, these layers provide enhanced security and a stronger, more protected transportation system for the traveling public,” the TSA said in a statement reacting to the report.
