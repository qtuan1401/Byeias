The latest Gallup poll shows 80 percent of all voters, and 77 percent of nonwhite voters, support requiring photo identification in order to cast a ballot. [“Though many of the arguments for early voting and against voter ID laws frequently cite minorities’ voting access, nonwhites’ views of the two policies don’t differ markedly from those of whites,” Gallup states. White and nonwhite voters also strongly support early voting, 80 percent and 77 percent respectively.  This seems to contradict the Democrats’ narrative there’s racism lurking at every polling station. Hillary Clinton herself stated that requiring voters to show the same ID they need to pick up prescriptions, board a flight, drive, apply for social safety net programs, purchase alcohol or cigarettes, open a bank account, or book at hotel room was a “blast from the Jim Crow past. ”   percent of Republicans and 83 percent of independents also support photo ID requirements, with 63 percent of Democrats joining them. “In sum, Americans want easier processes for registering to vote and casting their ballots, as well as stronger checks against fraud,” Gallup concluded. The prospect of widespread voter fraud has become a serious public concern in the months leading up to the 2016 election, especially for Republican voters.   percent told pollsters that voter fraud was a “major problem,” with a quarter of Democrats agreeing.
