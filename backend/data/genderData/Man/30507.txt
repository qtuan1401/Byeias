The Jerusalem Post reports: Just one day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with US President Barack Obama at the UN, in which Netanyahu thanked Obama for the signing of a $38 billion military aid package, Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi on Thursday panned the US president as “naive and messianic” towards Israel.
