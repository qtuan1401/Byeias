 (CNN) Here’s a look at Guantánamo Bay Naval Station and its detention facilities. Facts:The base, sometimes referred to as ”Gitmo,” is located in southeastern Cuba, on the coast of Guantánamo Bay.  The United States has been leasing the 45 square miles that the base sits on since 1903. The base shares a   border with Cuba.  The lease can only be terminated by mutual agreement.  Detention Facilities:In response to the   attacks in 2001, and subsequent military operations in Afghanistan, existing migrant detention facilities at Guantánamo were repurposed to hold detainees in the ”war on terror.”  During the administration of President George W. Bush ( ) the United States claimed that Guantánamo Bay detainees were not on US soil and therefore not covered by the US Constitution, and that ”enemy combatant” status meant they could be denied some legal protections. Shortly after his inauguration in 2009, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facilities within one year. However, the facilities are still open as of 2017. There are 41 detainees at Guantánamo Bay as of January 2017. More than 700 detainees have been held at Guantánamo since it opened. Peak population was 684 detainees in June 2003. At least nine detainees have died in custody. The US Defense Department spent about $445 million to run Guantánamo Bay in 2015, down from $522. 2 million in 2010.   Timeline:1903   The new Republic of Cuba leases 45 square miles of land in Guantánamo Bay to the United States for construction of a naval station. Building on the naval station begins that same year. 1934   Cuba and the United States sign a perpetual lease that rents the 45 square miles of Cuba to the US for $4, 085. 00 a year.  1991   Approximately 34, 000 Haitian refugees are detained on the base after they flee a coup in Haiti.

June 28, 2004   A divided Supreme Court rules that the Guantánamo detainees have some rights but leaves open how these rights will be exercised.

He was forced to wear a bra, dance with a man and do dog tricks while tied to a leash. But military investigators said that was not considered prohibited, inhumane treatment.
