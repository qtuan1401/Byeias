’  ’ ’   A provocative mural protesting Maine Gov. Paul LePage has   appeared in Portland, Maine, this week. ’ ’   The mural, which an unknown artist drew this week in   Portland, Maine, originally depicted the embattled governor   wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe next to the words ”RACIST,”   ”HOMOPHOBE” and ”MORON.” A fourth word, ”GOVERNOR,” was crossed   out with a red line. ’ ’   However, yesterday, the artwork underwent a number of   transformations at the hands of vigilante residents.  ’ ’   First, according to NBC affiliate  two LePage supporters painted over the mural with   white paint. Then, opponents of the governor scrubbed the paint   off, restoring the original image. ’ ’  ’ ’   Late Tuesday night, ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tA graffiti mural of LePage originally had him dressed as a KKK leader, but this morning he has Mickey ears.  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
