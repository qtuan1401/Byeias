’  ’ ’   Last month, Republican Rep. Tom Reed of New   York  that harked back to what critics call   one of the worst relics of the ”war on drugs.” ’ ’   The legislation would allow federal prosecutors to charge a   drug dealer with life in prison or the death penalty when they   can connect the dealer to an overdose death caused   by heroin laced with fentanyl,  ’ ’ the   H ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’   The current overdose crisis has caused a resurgence of the laws.   Many prosecutors, like those  Louisiana, and West Virginia,   have  to try to curtail   overdose deaths and deter drug dealers, The Washington Post   reported in May.  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   But a growing consensus of addicts,   experts, and   scientific research says measures like the HELP Act are more   likely to exacerbate the US’s worsening overdose crisis. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   But the ineffectiveness of the policy is only a minor problem   when compared to how such laws are actually used, experts say. In   contrast to Reed’s statement,   homicide laws are used   most often  ” ’   ’ ’do put   themselves in those types of situations  —   like shooting up with   the overdose victim. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”If [users are] going to have the book thrown at them in these   states, you have the inverse of what you want in terms of   protecting people at risk of overdoses,” Grant Smith, deputy   director of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance, told   Business Insider earlier this year. ”They are trying to dissuade   people from selling these substances but, in the process, they   are creating more overdoses because people are scared to call for   help because they sold it.” ’
