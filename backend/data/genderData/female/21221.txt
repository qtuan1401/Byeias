MTV News Senior National Correspondent Jamil Smith argued Republican presidential candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s abortion position is an example of “actual attacks on women” on Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “MTP Daily. ”  Smith said, “[H]e opens up another line of attack, potentially, by saying real men don’t attack women, when Ted Cruz opposes all abortion, including abortion in the case rape and incest. So, we want to talk about actual attacks on women, you know, tweets about your wife are terrible, but I think that we should talk about some bigger issues. ” (  Ken Shepherd) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
