Netflix currently has just 31 movies from IMDB’s top 250 list, after the movie streaming service has nearly halved its library since 2012 in favor of producing more original content. [In 2014, Netflix boasted 49 movies from IMDB’s top 250 list. Two years later, Netflix have dropped 18 of cinema’s most popular titles.  The streaming service still shows classics such as Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, Back to the Future, and The Shining. Lost titles, however, include favorites such as Donnie Darko, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, and Kill Bill Volume One. “Licensing arrangements with outside TV and film distributors have a fixed term, and thus represent a recurring cost if you want to continue offering their content in your library,” explained TechCrunch reporter Darrell Etherington. “Original content is a    expense (though admittedly higher  ) which then permanently continues to the breadth and size of your video catalog. ” Netflix originals and exclusives such as House of Cards, Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, and Narcos have proved immensely popular among the service’s audience, prompting Netflix to focus more on original content, such as the upcoming Series of Unfortunate Events.
