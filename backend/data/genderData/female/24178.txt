Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that “[A]nybody who knows me knows you can’t buy me” and that “the billionaires” are opposing her on Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Hardball. ”  Hillary said, in response to attacks on her by fellow candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) “I think the people in Iowa want to go to the caucuses thinking about which one of us. as president, can actually make a difference in their lives. And that’s the case I’ve been focused on making. So, you know, it would be a sharp departure by Senator Sanders, and, you know, the other part of this is anybody who knows me knows you can’t buy me. ” She added, when asked about Sanders’ criticisms of her ties to Goldman Sachs “I think he’s trying to go to the line without going over it, and you know, clearly some of the journalists covering us are starting to notice and call him out on it. But I feel very, you know, very positive and energized by what I’m seeing happening here in Iowa, and I know that I have the best plan to reign in Wall Street abuses, to make sure it doesn’t ever happen again. Lots of folks, from Barney Frank to Paul Krugman have said that’s the case, because I don’t just go after the big banks. You know, we have the authority to do that under   and I have said that I would use that authority if they were posing a systemic risk to our economy. But equally importantly, we’ve got to go after the shadow banking sector. Let’s not forget, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Countrywide, Wachovia. And let’s also remind people, Chris, that clearly, the billionaires, as Bernie likes to say, the billionaires have chosen sides, they’re running ads against me, and tried to kind of hoodwink Democrats into voting against me, because they know exactly what I will do, because they see me in action. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
