Military whistleblower Bradley Manning, who now goes by the name of “Chelsea,” was rushed to hospital on Tuesday after it was reported that he attempted to take his own life. [Manning is currently serving a 35 year prison sentence after he was convicted of leaking classified military material to Julian Assange’s whistleblower site WikiLeaks in 2013. During his time in prison, Manning came out as transgender and changed his name from Bradley to Chelsea.  It is reported that Manning was being held in a hospital close to the U. S. Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas where he has been serving his sentence. Manning’s attorney Chase Strangio was unable to confirm the report to CNN, stating “I am still trying to figure out what is happening. I have unfortunately not been contacted by Leavenworth and have no additional information. ” However Colonel Patrick Seiber, a spokesperson for the U. S. Army did confirm that Manning had been hospitalized “during the early hours of July 5th” but was now located back at the barracks where U. S. Army officials “continue to monitor the inmate’s condition”. It is unknown as to what condition Manning is currently in, as well as the reasons for Manning’s attempted suicide, however one source told TMZ that his attempted method was hanging.
