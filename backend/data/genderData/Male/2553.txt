ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia  —   Gunmen have killed more than 140 civilians near Ethiopia’s western border with South Sudan, an Ethiopian official said on Saturday. The attackers came from South Sudan and killed civilians, including women and children, said Getachew Reda, the communications minister. “The Ethiopian defense force is currently chasing after the perpetrators,” Mr. Reda said, adding that the attackers did not have links to South Sudan’s government or its rebel fighters. “Our defense forces have so far killed 60 members of the attackers,” he said. Mr. Reda added that Ethiopian forces might cross into South Sudan to pursue the gunmen. The attack took place on Friday in Jakawa, in the Gambela region of Ethiopia, and the attackers were members of South Sudan’s Murle tribe, Mr. Reda said. A number of children were abducted and taken into South Sudan, he said. The Gambela region hosts thousands of refugees who fled South Sudan after war broke out there in December 2013. It is also home to armed Ethiopian and South Sudanese groups that attack government installations and soldiers. In the 1980s, the Ethiopian government forcibly resettled hundreds of thousands of people, and the negative effects of those relocations are still felt in many Ethiopian communities, most notably in the Gambela region. In 2004, attackers killed 196 people in the western Gambela region in an outbreak of communal violence.
