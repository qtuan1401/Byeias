’  ’ ”   Early results came in from the US Air Force’s realistic,   challenging Red Flag air combat exercise  —   and it looks like the     slaughtered the competition. ” ’ that the Joint Strike   Fighter killed 15 aggressors for each   downed. The     achieved this remarkable ratio in a drastically increased threat   environment that included radar jamming, increased air threats,   and    missile batteries. ’ ’   ”In the past, the   effects were not fully integrated   into the kinetic fight,” Col. Robert Cole, the Air Force Cyber   Forward director, . ’ ’   But now   take on cyberthreats and electronic warfare in   addition to enemy surveillance and conventional, or kinetic,   threats. ’ ’   ”This integration in an exercise environment allows our planners   and warfighters to understand how to best integrate these, learn   their capabilities and limitations, and become ready to use   [these combined resources for maximum] effect against our   adversaries,” Cole said. ’ ’  ’ ”   But the   didn’t just shoot down the enemy  —   they used their     and data link abilities to talk to other planes and   help them sniff out threats they wouldn’t have seen on their own. ” ’   ”Before, where we would have one advanced threat and we would put   everything we had  —         missiles, we would shoot   everything we had at that one threat just to take it out  —   now we   are seeing three or four of those threats at a time,” Lt. Col.   George Watkins, 34th Fighter Squadron commander, told Aviation   Week. ’ ’   ”Just between [the  ] and the [ ] Raptor, we are able to   geolocate them,   them, and then we are able to   bring the   assets in behind us after those   threats are neutralized,” Watkins said. ”It’’s a whole different   world out there for us now.” ’ ’   The ability of   US aircraft to detect threats and   send that information to legacy planes meets an urgent need for   the US military. ’ ’  ’ ’   As adversarial nations like China and Russia improve their    and air defenses,   . ’ ”   The   repeatedly hit cost and schedule overruns during its   production and is now years behind schedule. But the latest   performance at Red Flag shows that even a handful of   can   improve an entire squadron’s performance. ” ’   The current Red Flag exercise will conclude on February 10. ’ ”Early results came in from the US Air Force’s. ..”
