During the July 10 airing of Fox News Sunday, Jesse Jackson said that   in Texas “can bring down airplanes. ”[Jackson’s discussion of guns began with his criticism of “  weapons on the streets. ”    Shannon Bream countered Jackson, pointing out that the phrase “  weapons” conjures up the image of the machine guns in the minds of listeners. She said it is “important to make a distinction” between gun types, particularly in light of the fact that the Dallas gunman used a semiautomatic rifle, not an automatic one. Jackson then attempted to counter Bream’s point, saying, “Yes, but in Texas these militarized   not only can they shoot up theaters and churches, they can bring down airplanes. ” He continued: It is irrational to me to have   weapons that can shoot like that. There’s no defense against them. When this guy, who was trained in the military, unleashes with his training these guns, he could not be stopped. That could happen in front of a ballgame or a church or a theater. We must know that more guns make us less safe, not more safe, and not more secure. It should be noted that Jackson’s hometown —  Chicago —  has a ban on “assault weapons,” a. k. a. “  weapons. ” Yet between January 1 and July 5, 2016 the city also had more homicides that Los Angeles and New York combined, according to NBC News. Moreover, the Chicago Tribune reported that overall number of shooting victims in Chicago January 1 to July 5 was 2, 026.
