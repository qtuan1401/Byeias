In an era of revivals and reboots, this may have been inevitable. NBC announced on Wednesday that it was bringing back its celebrated comedy “Will  Grace” for 10 episodes during the   TV season. The show’s original cast  —   Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally  —   will all return, as will the show’s director, James Burrows, and the show’s creators, Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. TV is going through a 1990s and early 2000s nostalgia craze, and “Will  Grace” is far from the first show to make a comeback. Netflix’s “Full House” revival, “Fuller House,” has already had two seasons. The streaming service also brought back “Gilmore Girls” in November. Fox brought back “The  ” with its original cast, and it was a ratings hit for the network last year. “Twin Peaks” will return in May, with many of the original cast members. “Will  Grace,” which ran from 1998 to 2006, was a hit and a critical darling  —   each of the lead cast members won an Emmy for their roles, and the show won the best comedy Emmy in its second season. NBC is having the strongest year among the big four networks in the most important audience to advertisers: adults under 50. But it is still in the midst of retooling its comedy slate, and “Will  Grace” could give it a shot in the arm whenever the show winds up running in the next season. Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, said in a statement, “This groundbreaking series for everything from gay rights to social and political commentary  —   all disguised as a   train of witty pop culture  —   is coming back where it belongs. ”
