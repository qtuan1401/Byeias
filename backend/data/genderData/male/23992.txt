The BlazeTV host and National Review’s Conservative “Thought Leader” Dana Loesch has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). [“Dana is a fearless conservative who is not afraid to confront the liberal media bias head on,” Cruz said in a statement released Tuesday. “She is a passionate fighter for liberty and an important voice for conservatives. I am thrilled to have Dana on our team and work together to win the White House in 2016. ”   Loesch praised Cruz for fighting for conservative values in Washington and being a leader for the Tea party movement. She said in a statement: As one of the original founders of the   Tea Party movement, I watched grassroots conservatives support Ted Cruz’s David and Goliath success against Dewhurst and the Republican establishment. Cruz has fought to repeal Obamacare, shrink the size of government he has defended our gun rights, our right to privacy, our sovereignty and borders. I personally feel that Ted Cruz is the best choice to reverse America’s road to ruin and am proud to support him in the 2016 Republican primary. “I have said that I will pull for the most consistent conservative in the race,” Loesch underlined.
