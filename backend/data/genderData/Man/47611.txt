’  ’ ’   If anyone is still making Harry Potter jokes about Daniel   Radcliffe, they won’’t be after seeing the British actor in the   first trailer for ”Imperium.” ’ ’   The thriller, which is inspired by a true story, features   Radcliffe as Nate Foster, a young, idealistic FBI agent who goes   undercover to take down a white supremacist terrorist group. ’ ’   Radcliffe, sporting an American accent, plays Foster as squeamish   and nervous in his undercover role, which drives the nonstop   intensity of the trailer. ’ ’   ”Imperium” is directed by Daniel Ragussis, who cowrote the film   with Michael German, a former agent who spent years inside the     movement. ’ ’   ”We’’re witnessing a surge in   groups all across Europe;   in some cases they’’re nearly winning national elections,”   Ragussis told . ”We have a stereotype of what it means to be a white   supremacist, but when I began collaborating with Michael [German]   and doing my own research, I was stunned by the depth and the   extent of this movement.” ’ ’   ”Imperium” will be released in theaters and   on August   19. ’ ’   Watch the full trailer: ’ ’ ’
