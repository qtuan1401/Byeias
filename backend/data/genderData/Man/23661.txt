Over the weekend, using science, math and    examples, I made the case that there is no reason, outside of a series of public relations catastrophes, for the box office disaster that is Quentin Tarantino’s “The Hateful Eight. ” What’s going to be fascinating now is how the Hollywood Media spins it. Box Office Mojo has declared the patient dead, all that’s left is the autopsy:  Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight imploded as the filmmaker’s latest film fell short of expectations last weekend and now, in its second weekend in wide release, it has dropped 59. 6%. Even worse, that drop comes as the film expanded into 464 additional theaters. With an estimated $6. 3 million this weekend the film is up to $41. 4 million domestically and looking to top out around $50 million or so. If “the Hateful Eight” does indeed bottom out at $50 million, it will rank as Tarantino’s lowest solo box office performance since “Jackie Brown” hit $40 million in 1997. (The experimental “Grindhouse,” which Tarantino   with a handful of others, earned $25 million in 2007.) “Hateful Eight cost around $50 million to produce. Add another $25 to $35 million for promotion and advertising. If the Weinstein Company is going to break even, this dog will have to gross somewhere around $150 to $175 million worldwide.  And judging from the results of the Golden Globes, there will be no Oscar boost. At this same time in 2012, “Django Unchained” sat at $106 million. At this same time in 2009, “Inglorious Basterds” sat at $73 million. Currently, “The Hateful Eight” sits at a calamitous $41 million and has already run out of steam. Gee, I wonder what changed between “Django Unchained” and “The Hateful Eight?”   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
