During an interview broadcast on Thursday’s “All In” on MSNBC, outgoing Senate Minority Leader Senator Harry Reid ( ) stated that after “going through the trauma of the election,” he was “concerned, is the world going to be destroyed?”  Red said, “[M]y first few days of going through the trauma of the election, an election where Hillary Clinton got 2 million more votes than he did. I understand the electoral system, a system where she lost four states by less than 100, 000 votes combined. Took me a while to accept that the next 24 hours after the election, but then I was concerned, is the world going to be destroyed?” Reid later added that he’s been thinking about domestic policy after realizing maybe the world won’t get blown up “right away. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
