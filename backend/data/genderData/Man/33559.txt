Low scores landed Kattan and Carson in the bottom two along with singer Charo and her partner Keo Motsepe. The combination of the judges’ scores and audience votes sent Kattan and Carson home.  ”She was an amazing inspiration, and I couldn’t have. .. done this without her,” Kattan said of Carson after they were eliminated. ”I wish that my surgery and all that was noted before.”
