Hillary and Bill Clinton’s shift over the years from middle class to multimillionaires has been perhaps most pronounced in the places they have called home. For 18 consecutive years, the Clintons lived in   housing, from the Arkansas governor’s mansion to the White House. Should Mrs. Clinton win the presidency in November, they would become the first “first couple” to swap roles and return to the White House. Here’s a look at the Clintons’ homes over the years: When They Were There:   What They Paid For It: $17, 200 What Was Going On in Their Lives: On Oct. 11, 1975, Bill and Hillary, then both law professors, were married in the living room of this Tudor revival home. The building, now a museum, is one of the four stops on the “Billgrimage” tour of Mr. Clinton’s   House life. _____ When They Were There:    What Was Going On in Their Lives: Mrs. Clinton had a hard time adjusting to life in Little Rock, which was more conservative than the college town of Fayetteville. The        home where they lived while Mr. Clinton was attorney general was a pit stop on the way to the governor’s mansion. _____ When They Were There:   What They Paid For It: $112, 000 What Was Going On in Their Lives: Mrs. Clinton partly used the proceeds from her investments and her savings to put a $60, 000 down payment on the home, in the city’s Hillcrest district, purchased in the dark days after Mr. Clinton lost his   bid for governor. She built wooden bookshelves in a sunny office (which locals joke was the first Clinton Library) and converted the attic into a room for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk there. _____ When They Were There: 1999 to present What They Paid For It: $1. 7 million What Was Going On in Their Lives: Laden with debt from legal bills while they were in the White House, the Clintons initially accepted help from their friend and   Terry McAuliffe to secure the mortgage on the home, but turned down the offer amid criticism. The   Dutch colonial in a wooded New York suburb in Westchester County gave Mrs. Clinton a perch from which she could run for a Senate seat from New York. The Clintons spend most of their downtime here,   “The Good Wife” and “Downton Abbey” and hosting Thanksgiving meals with Chelsea and her friends. _____ When They Were There: 2000 to present What They Paid For It: $2. 85 million What Was Going On in Their Lives: With Mrs. Clinton set to represent New York in the Senate, the Clintons needed a home in Washington. The    home, in an area known as “Embassy Row,” takes up a third of an acre on a   lot, and has seven bedrooms, a den, a pool and a terrace. The relatively secure location makes it a favorite place for the Clintons to entertain and hold meetings away from prying reporters’ eyes. _____ When They Were There: 2004 to present, on and off What Was Going On in Their Lives: Perched atop the Clinton library (which locals joke looks like a glass trailer park) is a tastefully decorated private residence where the Clintons stay when they’re in Little Rock. The apartment has a sprawling terrace overlooking the Arkansas River and the aptly named Clinton Presidential Park Bridge. Mr. Clinton, famously a night owl, is known to tap into the archives to frequently redecorate with memorabilia from his presidency.
