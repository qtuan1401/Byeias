Microsoft is attempting to lure users to its own Edge browser (formerly Internet Explorer) by creating   “tips” that claim the browser to be safer than competitors. [The tip has been reported to pop up when users launch competing browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, however it is not currently known as to how long this function has been implemented.  In July, it was discovered that Windows 10 would provide a “tip” that encouraged people to use the supposedly more   Edge browser instead of competitors when charge was getting low on a user’s laptop. “These Windows Tips notifications were created to provide people with quick, easy information,” said a Microsoft spokesman in July after people noticed, adding that they “can help them enhance their Windows 10 experience. ” It was also announced this week that Netflix’s 4K mode would be heading to PC, with Microsoft capitalizing on the announcement with an exclusivity deal to market their Edge browser. “While a number of TVs and    already support 4K Netflix streams, the PC has largely been left out of the   streams due to piracy fears,” wrote the Verge. “Netflix is now supporting 4K streaming through Microsoft’s Edge browser, but you’ll need a new PC to actually make use of it. Netflix is only supporting 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors, and there aren’t many laptops that actually support both the 4K display required and the new Intel processors. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
