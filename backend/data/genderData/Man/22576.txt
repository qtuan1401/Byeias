A group of high school students in Florida are in trouble after posting a recording on social media of them having sex in their school bathroom, reports 6ABC.  The incident happened Tuesday after school hours at Fort Myers High School, and involved one girl and as many as two dozen boys. The sheriff’s office said the girl’s mother does not plan to press charges. The students involved have all been disciplined, a school district official told 6ABC.
