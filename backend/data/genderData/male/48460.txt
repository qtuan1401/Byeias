’  ’ ’   Tesla cars are getting a giant upgrade.  ’ ”   On Sunday, CEO Elon Musk revealed  its biggest software   update yet. The update, which is slated to roll out   worldwide in a week or two, will include significant updates to   Tesla’s   system called Autopilot.  ” ’   The update will make Tesla vehicles three times safer than cars   without Autopilot, Musk said during a press call Sunday.  ’ ’  ’ ’   Musk said Tesla has improved the accuracy of Autopilot by making   more use of the radar sensor on Tesla vehicles. Until now, the   radar sensor has been a supplementary sensor, but now it will   play a greater role in determining whether an object is a danger.   The camera and   system that currently powers   the semiautonomous system will still be used, but the data   collected by the radar will carry more weight when deciding how   the car should react when in Autopilot.  ’ ’’ ’   Musk said that he believes that the change could have prevented   the fatal accident that occurred in May, when    Joshua   Brown crashed into a semitruck while driving down the highway   using Autopilot.  ’ ”   As part of the software update, Tesla’s Autopilot will also be   able to automatically take   exits and will have improved   Autosteering.  ” ’   Because Tesla cars are connected to the cloud, the company can   push out    software updates to give its cars new   features. The   maker rolled out its last big update,   Tesla 7. 1, in January.  ’
