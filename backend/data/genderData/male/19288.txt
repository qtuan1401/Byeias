Thousands of individuals have signed an online petition seeking to nudge Ohio Governor John Kasich (R) into allowing concealed carry firearms into the Republican National Committee Convention in Cleveland. [The convention will be held in Quicken Loans Arena, which currently bars guns from the premises.  The petition —  which can be found at Change. Org —  calls on Quicken Loans Arena to suspend “their policy preventing the open carry of firearms on the premises of the arena from July   2016 to coincide with the Republican National Convention. ” The petition also asks the NRA to join the fray by issuing “an immediate condemnation of the egregious affront to the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution constituted by the ‘  zone’ loophole to the state law. ” Fox 5 reports the petition describes the   policy as “a direct affront to the Second Amendment,” and claims the   approach “puts all attendees at risk. ” The authors of the petition are calling on Governor Kasich to use executive authority to allow guns at the convention. It should be noted that Change. Org hosts a hotbed of activity for gun control proponents launching various petitions to secure more gun control at the federal and state level. For example, there was a petition seeking more federal control in the wake of the October 1 Umpqua Community College attack and another seeking more federal gun control because of Chicago gun crime. And there have been numerous other gun control petitions at Change. Org in addition to these.
