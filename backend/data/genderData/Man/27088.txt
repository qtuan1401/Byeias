McALLEN, Texas  —   For the twelfth year in a row, McAllen Police and their civilian Crime Stoppers program have reached out to the needy families by helping them enjoy a Thanksgiving meal. [More than 150 families lined up outside of the McAllen Police station for the 12th Annual Turkey Giveaway. The families were chosen by the local school district and police officers who identified need in the communities they patrol. During the giveaway, residents were given shopping bags with a turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and other Thanksgiving staples.  “For these families, this will be their Thanksgiving meal,” McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez told Breitbart Texas. “If it wasn’t for this effort by our Crime Stopper volunteers, these families would not be able to enjoy a proper Thanksgiving meal. ”  The Crime Stoppers program gives police officers and investigators another way to get help from the community in solving crimes where law enforcement may hit a roadblock. According to Rodriguez, throughout the year, McAllen Police asks for the community’s help in obtaining information and the giveaway is just one way for the Crime Stoppers program and his department to pay it back.  “This department has a close relation with the community,” Rodriguez said. “Our residents trust us and event like this or our Christmas event allow us to be closer to them. ”    McAllen resident San Juana Avila held back tears as the volunteers handed her food.  “They are so nice,” Avila said. “In the news people say bad things about police officers but no, they are a blessing. They are there to help and they have been very nice to me   …     I pray they receive many blessings. ”  Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
