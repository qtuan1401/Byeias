Robert Costa of The Washington Post joined Breitbart News Daily with host Stephen K. Bannon on Friday morning and addressed speculation and chatter that a new video put out by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan could serve as a campaign ad. [“I think Ryan is putting himself out there as a national political figure that people can point to beyond the presidential campaign as a face of the Republican Party,” Costa told Bannon. “Based on my reporting, I don’t see any kind of overt or indirect movement toward a presidential bid. But certainly, he is someone celebrated by party elite and conservative figures as someone that could step in in a chaos situation in Cleveland. ”  Costa added, “But most activists, most voters [that] we’ve talked to want someone who has been running for president to acutally be the nominee. ” Breitbart News Daily airs weekday from 6 a. m. to 9 a. m. on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125.
