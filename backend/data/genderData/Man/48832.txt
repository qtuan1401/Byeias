’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama is declaring a major disaster in Florida,   meaning that the state can become eligible for additional federal   aid. ’ ’   But Florida Gov. Rick Scott said the declaration was limited to   help with debris removal and emergency protective measures. That   means the state will not receive aid for individual assistance or   for funding to help with government buildings and roads. ’ ”   Hurricane Matthew scraped along Florida’s eastern coast and   caused power outages, beach erosion and flooding and is   responsible for at least four deaths. State officials said that   as of   Sunday that there were nearly 423, 000 people still   without power. ” ’   Scott said in a statement that Florida did sustain for   ”significant damage” and that he will continue to submit requests   to the federal government for additional assistance. ’ ’  ’ ’   More than 442, 000 electric customers in Florida are without power   in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. ’ ”   Governor Rick Scott’s office released the latest outage figures   Sunday morning. The number represents about 4 percent of all   electric customers in the state. ” ’   The most customers without power were in Duval County, with about   134, 000. That was followed by Volusia County with just over   129, 000 and about 42, 000 in both Brevard and Flagler counties. ’ ”   At the storm’s height Friday, more than 1 million customers in   Florida were without electricity. ” ”   Scott has said the state’s large utilities told him their goal   was to have most power restored by Sunday night. ”
