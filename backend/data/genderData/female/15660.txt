Students at the prestigious University of Massachusetts, Amherst, are participating in a   “sh* ” demonstration, occupying restrooms in an administrative building to demand more   bathrooms on campus. [The “sh* ” was led by Amherst’s Gender Liberation Union, a campus group that successfully gathered over 220 students to occupy bathroom stalls in the school’s administrative building.  Justin Killian, a gender and sexuality major at Amherst, organized the protest event. Kilian, speaking to The Huffington Post, argued that Massachusett’s transgender bathroom legislation only does so much. “We have legal protections in Massachusetts that allow people to use any bathroom they feel comfortable with,” Kilian explained. “But having the legal ability doesn’t mean cultural ability. ” “We want a third space that does not have cultural or gender surveillance,” she said. “The administration agreed to our progressive benchmarks within two days. ” Kilian said proudly. “Hormones are now available at Health Services. Before, you had to drive two hours to get them. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
