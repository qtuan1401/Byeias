The video above shows the shocking moment when a horde of South London residents stole cases of water from London Marathon runners today, shoving them in bags, suitcases, and carrying them off down the streets. [The videos were posted online today, and shows dozens of people making off with bottles of Buxton water.  The Mail reports:  Bystanders including children could be seen reaching into crates filled with multipacks of bottled water and putting them into   shopping trolleys, large plastic shopping bags and even on top of pushchairs. The Buxton water marshalls seemed helpless as people pushed over the top of each other grabbing what they could. Filming the moment appeared to be one the water station volunteers, thought to be Mark Hudson, who sarcastically said the water supply hadnâ€™t reached the area yet in a Facebook post. The police are investigated the incident, and Buxton water officials at the scene were warned to avoid altercations with the thieving residents.
