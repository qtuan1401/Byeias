Republican Congressman David Jolly has introduced legislation that would ban the federal government from purchasing Apple products until the Silicon Valley firm agrees to cooperate with the FBI’s request to decrypt the iPhone of San Bernardino jihadi Syed Farook. [A court recently ordered that Apple comply with the FBI’s investigation, yet the company has continued to refuse and is seeking to repeal that order.  The company’s position is the source of ongoing tensions between the firm and has infuriated many politicians, customers, and the families of the victims. “Taxpayers should not be subsidising a company that refuses to cooperate in a terror investigation that left 14 Americans dead on American soil,” Jolly said. “Following the horrific events of Sept. 11, 2001, every citizen and every company was willing to do whatever it took to side with law enforcement and defeat terror,” Jolly added. “It’s time Apple shows that same conviction to further protect our nation today. ” The legislation, entitled the No Taxpayer Support for Apple Act, proposes that no federal agency can buy any Apple product “until a court of federal jurisdiction certifies that Apple has provided the federal government with the technical support necessary to access encrypted information sought by a judicial warrant that may be materially relevant to the investigation of commission of terrorism. ” Meanwhile Apple CEO Tim Cook has defended his company’s position, citing their refusal on the grounds of civil liberties and that unlocking the phone would set a bad precedent for the future of data protection. Their stance has been supported by firms such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook. You can follow Ben Kew on Twitter at @ben_kew or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
