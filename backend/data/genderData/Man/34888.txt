 (CNN) It’s the touching tale being shared across social media following Roger Moore’s death. Londoner Marc Hayes recalled a story about the actor, who was best known for his portrayal of James Bond in the ’70s and ’80s, on Facebook. The post is a poignant reminder of why we idolize television and movie stars. Read it below: As an seven year old in about 1983, in the days before First Class Lounges at airports, I was with my grandad in Nice Airport and saw Roger Moore sitting at the departure gate, reading a paper. I told my granddad I’d just seen James Bond and asked if we could go over so I could get his autograph. My grandad had no idea who James Bond or Roger Moore were, so we walked over and he popped me in front of Roger Moore, with the words ”my grandson says you’re famous. Can you sign this?” As charming as you’d expect, Roger asks my name and duly signs the back of my plane ticket, a fulsome note full of best wishes. I’m ecstatic, but as we head back to our seats, I glance down at the signature. It’s hard to decipher it but it definitely doesn’t say ’James Bond’. My grandad looks at it, half figures out it says ’Roger Moore’   I have absolutely no idea who that is, and my hearts sinks. I tell my grandad he’s signed it wrong, that he’s put someone else’s name   so my grandad heads back to Roger Moore, holding the ticket which he’s only just signed. I remember staying by our seats and my grandad saying ”he says you’ve signed the wrong name. He says your name is James Bond.” Roger Moore’s face crinkled up with realisation and he beckoned me over. When I was by his knee, he leant over, looked from side to side, raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said to me, ”I have to sign my name as ’Roger Moore’ because otherwise. ..Blofeld might find out I was here.” He asked me not to tell anyone that I’d just seen James Bond, and he thanked me for keeping his secret. I went back to our seats, my nerves absolutely jangling with delight. My grandad asked me if he’d signed ’James Bond.’ No, I said. I’d got it wrong. I was working with James Bond now. Many, many years later, I was working as a scriptwriter on a recording that involved UNICEF, and Roger Moore was doing a piece to camera as an ambassador. He was completely lovely and while the cameramen were setting up, I told him in passing the story of when I met him in Nice Airport. He was happy to hear it, and he had a chuckle and said ”Well, I don’t remember but I’m glad you got to meet James Bond.” So that was lovely. And then he did something so brilliant. After the filming, he walked past me in the corridor, heading out to his car   but as he got level, he paused, looked both ways, raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said, ”Of course I remember our meeting in Nice. But I didn’t say anything in there, because those cameramen   any one of them could be working for Blofeld.” I was as delighted at 30 as I had been at 7. What a man. What a tremendous man.
