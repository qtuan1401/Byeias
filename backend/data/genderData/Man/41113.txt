 (CNN) Devastating floods in northern Chile have left at least 25 people dead, and officials fear that number could rise. According to the countryâ€™s disaster agency, 125 people are still missing. More than 30, 000 people have been affected by the floods, while close to 3, 000 are being housed in emergency shelters, the agency said. Over the weekend, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet visited the region of Atacama, which was hardest hit. Tarapaca, Antofagasta and Coquimbo were also struck.  Photographs show people up to their knees in water and mud. Some wore masks over their faces as they shoveled the murky mix. In a bid to stem the spread of disease, authorities have sent tetanus, rabies, Hepatitis A and flu shots to the area. They are also working to restore water and electricity, but if the photographs are any indication, recovery will be a long road.
