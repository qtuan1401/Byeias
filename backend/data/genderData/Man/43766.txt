’  ’ ’   A group of activists protesting against the Dakota Access oil   pipeline set their campground dwellings on fire in a symbolic   final act as the deadline for them to leave passed on Wednesday. ’ ’   About 150 protesters remained out of the thousands that   originally occupied the main encampment in Cannon Ball, North   Dakota, by the time the 2 p. m. deadline rolled around. A small   group stayed after the deadline, and are facing arrest, according   to media reports. ’ ’   ”It’’s an act of defiance,” protester Nick Cowan . ”It’s saying, ’’If you are going to   make us leave our home, you cannot take our space. We’’ll burn it   to the ground and let the earth take it back before you take it   from us. ’’” ’ ”   Wednesday’s deadline, issued last week by North Dakota Gov. Doug   Burgum, ended six months of resistance from the local Standing   Rock Sioux tribe and activists who demanded an environmental   review of the pipeline before its construction. The pipeline,   they fear, could result in catastrophic oil spills that would   damage sacred sites and pollute the water supply. ” ’   Burning the remnants of the encampment is in line with Standing   Rock tradition, according to one activist and journalist at the   scene. ’ ’   ”For some Indigenous peoples, when traditional dwellings are   erected they are not dismantled in a conventional way,” Jenni   Monet . ”They are taken apart in a ceremonial way and   that ceremonial way is by burning.” ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’A group of activists protesting against the. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
