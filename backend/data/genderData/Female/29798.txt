A man with a bionic penis claims to have received dozens of messages from women eager to have sexual intercourse with him. [Mohammed Abar, 44, lost his sex organ in an accident when he was younger. However, he recently had a bionic penis installed and claims he has been inundated with over 50 messages from women eager to experience his  prosthetic manhood.  “I get a lot of messages from women online who ask me if I will have sex with them,” he said. “They’ve heard about my bionic penis and they want to try it out. They are all very intrigued and think I can make love for hours,” he continued. “It’s not that I don’t want to and I get offers, but I have been so busy with work. I work   shifts every day and by the time I get home I’m just too tired for sex,” he said. Unfortunately for Mohammed, he will not be able to have children, despite his bionic penis, after attempts during the operation to extract his sperm failed. However he could soon be tying the knot permanently, after he revealed his parents are looking to organise an arranged marriage. “We’re speaking to a few parties at the moment. I don’t care what she looks like, she could be tall, short, thin or fat. I prefer personality to looks. My parents will find me a suitable match,” he added.
