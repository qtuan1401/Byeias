 (CNN) A man was found dead Sunday morning in a pool at Demi Moore’s Beverly Hills home, the Los Angeles Police Department’s West Los Angeles Division said. The Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office identified the man as Edenilson Steven Valle, 21, of Los Angeles. He was found floating in the deep end of the pool early Sunday morning, according to Lt. Fred Corral of the coroner’s office. Paramedics attempted to revive him but were unsuccessful, Corral said. Police questioned five people in the home, where a party had been held, police Officer Matthew Jones said. ”Who threw the party, we do not know at this time,” he said. Moore, who was not home at the time, issued a statement via her publicist saying she was ”in absolute shock.” ”I was out of the country traveling to meet my daughters for a birthday celebration when I got the devastating news,” she said in the statement. ”The loss of a child is an unthinkable tragedy and my heart goes out to this young man’s family and friends.”
