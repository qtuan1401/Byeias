“They Shall Not Pass” is the first expansion for EA and DICE’s World War I   shooter, Battlefield 1. [The expansion adds the French army to the game’s multiplayer, along with new maps, weapons, vehicles, and a brand new game mode, Frontlines.  “Experience a mix of Conquest and Rush as you fight for chained control points in a    frontline,” DICE explains about the new Frontlines mode. “Both teams fight for one flag at a time and when this objective is captured the action moves on to the next. Capture the enemy’s HQ control point and the game turns into a   section where telegraph posts need to be attacked or defended. ” They Shall Not Pass will be available to Battlefield 1 Premium Pass owners on March 14.
