On September 14 Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (  ) called on the   House to allow a “gun vote” on new versions of old controls that Democrats have been pushing for years. [In hopes of gaining traction, Pelosi presented the vote as a way to do something for children.  She tweeted, “House GOP,  give us a gun vote. What are you afraid of?” She ended the tweet with “#gunviolence #doyourjob. ” A video embedded in the tweet shows Pelosi standing on the House floor, saying: Whose political survival is more important than the lives of these children, of those people in church, of those young people out on a Saturday night, people who go to the movies? Whose political survival is more important than protecting the American people? That’s the oath we take, “to protect and defend,” whether it’s the Constitution, whether it’s protecting our country, national security, our neighborhood security, our personal security. . @HouseGOP, give us a #gunvote. What are you afraid of? #gunviolence #doyourjob pic. twitter.   —   Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) September 14, 2016,  She also suggested House Republicans need to allow a “gun vote” as a way to “respond to those moms and family members and survivors from Pulse who said, ‘Why? Why are you not passing legislation in the House of Representatives to prevent gun violence, to save lives? ’” Pelosi did not mention that Orlando Pulse had 100 percent gun control —  it was a   zone. Nor did she mention that the man who attacked Pulse passed a background check for both his guns, including a waiting period, and he was not on terror watch lists, so additional gun controls like “   ” would have been of no consequence.
