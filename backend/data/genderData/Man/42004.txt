 (CNN) What’s the perfect gift for fans still all tied up in ”Fifty Shades of Grey”? A new book, of course. Writer E. L. James announced on her Instagram account Monday that a new ”Fifty Shades” book told from hero Christian Grey’s perspective will be published June 18. The release of ”Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian” coincides with a very special day for one of the main characters of James’ wildly successful franchise.  ”For those of you who have asked, Christian’s POV of #FSOG is published on 18th June for his birthday,” the post says. ”It’s called GREY. .. I hope you enjoy it.” ”Christian is a complex character and readers have always been fascinated by his desires and motivations, and his troubled past. Also, as anyone who has ever been in a relationship knows, there are two sides to every story,” James said in a statement posted on her site. ”It’s been a great pleasure to return to my happy   being with Christian and Ana in their universe, and working with the fantastic team at Vintage.” The trilogy of ”Fifty Shades of Grey,” ”Fifty Shades Darker” and ”Fifty Shades Freed” caught Hollywood’s attention, and the first book was made into one of the most highly anticipated films of 2015. The film stars Jamie Dornan as Christian and Dakota Johnson as his love interest, Anastasia. It’s made more than $166 million since its release February 14. The sequel, ”FIfty Shades Darker,” is set to arrive in theaters in 2017.
