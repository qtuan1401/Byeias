Los Angeles (CNN) A molestation claim made against the estate of Michael Jackson has been dismissed. Wade Robson, a   filed a claim against the pop star’s estate in May 2013, alleging he was sexually abused. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell L. Beckloff ruled Tuesday that Robson waited too long to file his legal claim. Robson was a key witness for the defense in Jackson’s 2005 criminal trial on child molestation charges. Jackson was found not guilty. ”The court’s dismissal of Robson’s claim against the Estate of Michael Jackson confirms that his lawsuit was inappropriately filed,” Howard Weitzman, an attorney for the estate of the late singer, said in an email. ”When Robson’s sole motivation was ’to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth’ he testified Michael never did anything improper.” Robson’s attorney, Maryann Marzano, told CNN that they plan to appeal the ruling. ”We are not about to throw in the towel,” Marzano said. ”We are confident that when all the facts are presented in civil court, there will be no doubt left about just what kind of sexual predator Michael Jackson was.” Jackson died in June 2009 as he was preparing for a comeback tour.
