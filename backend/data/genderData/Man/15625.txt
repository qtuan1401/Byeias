Last Wednesday, Elton John interrupted his performance at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles in order to pay tribute to the late David Bowie, acknowledging Bowie’s aid in launching John’s career. [John was premiering songs from his new album, but he stopped to take time for an anecdote, recalling that before his rise to stardom, he had been searching for a new producer and arranger when he heard Bowie’s “Space Oddity,” according to CBS Los Angeles. John hired the producer of “Space Oddity,” Gus Dudgeon, who helped him produce his first hit, “Your Song. ”  John continued, “I have David Bowie to thank for that. So I’d like to dedicate this to the star man himself. ” He then sang “Space Oddity” before segueing into “Rocket Man. ” Video of John’s tribute to Bowie can be seen here and below.  John’s new album will be released by Island records February 5. Three Island clients joined him in the concert: Demi Levato, Shawn Mendes and Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy. John admitted, “Playing new songs for the first time is a terrifying feeling. Thank you for being so patient. ”
