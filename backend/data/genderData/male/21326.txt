Twitter and BuzzFeed have reached a deal where the   news site will have its own stream of election night exclusively on the social media platform. [Adam Sharp, Twitter’s head of news, government, and elections, said that there is “absolutely an appetite” among young political users, with users who are 25 or under comprising over half of election related tweets.  Sharp also contends that young people would rather watch coverage from BuzzFeed, as it will give “unique vibrancy and perspective,” as opposed to mainstream channels such as CNN and FOX News. The coverage will mainly involve BuzzFeed reporters following the development of the election, but Sharp added it will also provide “intense, sophisticated conversation among analysts. ” Other features of their coverage will include explanations as to how the American electoral system works, and will attempt to call races ahead of time with the help of Decision Desk HQ, a volunteer based polling organisation, which BuzzFeed’s editor in chief describes as “America’s fairest new election night vote counter. ” The move comes at a time when Twitter is struggling to compete with Facebook in its expansion into live video. The company signed a deal in April to live stream Thursday night NFL games, and has also live streamed both the presidential and   debates. However, initial viewing figures have proved disappointing.
