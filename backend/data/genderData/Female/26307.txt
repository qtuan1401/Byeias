GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson tells Fox News on Saturday about a meeting between him and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) that took place after the Conservative Review’s Conservative Convention in Greenville, South Carolina on Thursday. [“We made changes,” Carson said when he found wrongdoing in his own campaign, implying Cruz should do the same. “You just don’t accept it. ”  “That’s what responsible people do,” he jabbed. Cruz had approached Carson about having a private meeting to discuss the controversy, which occurred during the Iowa caucus. Cruz’s campaign supporters told voters news reports said Carson was “suspending campaigning,” so they should vote for Cruz instead of Carson. Carson didn’t appear pleased with the meeting, but told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, “It’s water under the bridge. ” “I’m ready to move on,” he added.
