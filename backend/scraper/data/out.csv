USA Today,0,[Zimmerman verdict renews focus on 'stand your ground' laws],"The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Sanford Fla. raised fresh discussion of ""stand your ground"" laws. The case centered around whether Zimmerman acted in self defense and drew national attention to Florida's law which allows people to defend themselves with force if they feel threatened in their home business car or a place where they ""have a legal right to be."" At least 22 states have a similar law according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. While Zimmerman did not ultimately use the ""stand your ground"" defense in his case Sanford police did not arrest him until almost two months after the shooting because of the Florida stand your ground rules that require police to have specific evidence to refute a self defense claim in order to arrest someone claiming self defense. That provision of the law ""does a disservice to Floridians because it's so vague"" said Florida Sen. Dwight Bullard a Democrat in an interview Sunday with CBS Miami. The police initially did not have evidence to disprove Zimmerman's self-defense claim said former Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee Jr. It was not until the case drew national attention and a Department of Justice investigation that prosecutors found evidence to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund is urging Attorney General Eric Holder to undertake a review of the case and encouraging Trayvon Martin's family to pursue civil action against Zimmerman. Last year a Florida task force headed by the lieutenant government reviewed the state's ""stand your ground"" law but in a final report the task force only made minor recommendations that required no action from the legislature. No changes were made to the law this year. ""The liberal activists tried to use that tragedy (the shooting death of Trayvon Martin) as an opportunity to take our rights as Americans"" said Florida House Speaker Rep. Will Weatherford a Republican on the attempts to change the state's stand your ground law. ""We stood our ground on Stand Your Ground."" Across the country at least 22 states have ""stand your ground"" laws with varying degrees of requirements for when citizens may use deadly force to protect themselves. Before these new laws were put in place beginning in 2005 people who felt threatened outside their home were required to flee from an attacker before they were allowed to use force to defend themselves. The new laws make clear however that if someone feels threatened either inside or outside their home they do not have to run away and are legally justified in using force to protect themselves. ""If (my family and I) are walking through the mall and someone attacks us I should not have to retreat. I should be able to defend myself in any place or forum that I need to"" said Florida Rep. Carlos Trujillo a Republican on Sunday in an interview with CBS Miami. Some states just allow people to defend themselves in their homes or businesses while others extend the law to cars or any place someone ""has a right to be."" Florida's law falls into this second category. (See chart) The Zimmerman case drew national attention to the ""stand you ground"" laws which were promoted by the National Rifle Association and the American Legislative Exchange Council through model legislation and advocacy. In a study of ""stand your ground"" laws commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research researchers found that in states with ""stand your ground"" laws the number of homicides had significantly increased from the years before the law was enacted. They found that the provision that allows self-defense ""in any place a person has a legal right to be"" is the driver of the increase in homicides. The increase in homicides they argue negates the claim that these laws reduce crime.

Huffington Post,0,[Senate Immigration Bill Passes Out Of Judiciary Committee],"WASHINGTON -- The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bipartisan ""gang of eight"" immigration bill on Tuesday in a 13 to 5 vote after a marathon final day of markup that stretched into the evening.  All Democrats on the committee along with Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and gang of eight Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) voted in favor of the bill which will now go to the Senate floor. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) who voted against the bill out of committee said he would support allowing it to move forward for debate -- rather than joining a filibuster -- once on the Senate floor. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) who was also a ""no"" vote said if it had been between his vote and moving the bill to the Senate floor he would have voted in favor.  The crowd in the room erupted into applause when the final vote tally was read rising to their feet and chanting ""Yes we can!"" then ""Si se puede!""  Democrats seemed equally pleased to vote the bill out of committee.  ""The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform"" Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said before the bill's passage. ""I hope that our history our values and our decency can inspire us finally to take action. We need an immigration system that lives up to American values and helps write the next great chapter in American history by reinvigorating our economy and enriching our communities."" Of 300 amendments offered to the gang of eight immigration bill the committee debated more than 200. The bill came out of months of work from the gang of eight which in addition to Graham and Flake includes Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). It includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants a streamlined legal immigration process tougher interior enforcement and increased border security.  One of the final issues to settle was over high-skilled worker visas called H1-Bs. An amendment that simplifies the process for companies to bring in workers in science technology engineering and math eventually passed on a voice vote. Hatch and Schumer came to a compromise that led Hatch to agree to vote the full bill out of committee although he did not commit to supporting its eventual passage.  It was a tough vote for Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) who has previously been wary of expanding H1-B visas. He voted in favor however citing the need for compromise and to get the bill through.  ""We've made concessions I never thought we'd have to make ... but we've made those concessions to win your support"" Durbin said to Hatch. ""We need your support and we want to pass this bill."" The amendment came under fire from the AFL-CIO labor federation which said the measure would hurt American workers. ""There is no reason why this strong coalition should accept anti-worker amendments"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""And let's be clear: Senator Orrin Hatch's H-1B amendments are unambiguous attacks on American workers.""  Some measures praised highly by immigrant rights advocates never went to a vote. Leahy brought up his amendment to allow LGBT couples equal protection under immigration law but withdrew it ""with a heavy heart"" when it became clear Democrats were willing to drop it so the bill would pass. A number of provisions lauded by advocates did make it in. The committee voted on Monday to approve Blumenthal's amendment that would block immigration raids in sensitive areas such as schools hospitals and places of worship except in extreme circumstances. A separate Blumenthal measure to restrict the use of solitary confinement in immigrant detention also passed on Monday also on a voice vote.  Although many Republican amendments failed some GOP senators such as Hatch were more successful than others. The committee voted on Monday to require a mandatory biometric exit system at airports with the highest volume of international air travel -- something Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) wanted to do nationwide but without success.  Amendments deemed poison pills failed unsurprisingly. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) attempted to add a change that would strip the bill of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants which is considered absolutely necessary to the bill by President Barack Obama Democrats and some Republicans. Five Republicans voted for that amendment while three -- Hatch Graham and Flake -- joined Democrats in opposing it.  Leahy said the amendment would gut the bill while Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said ""it goes against everything America stands for."" Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) similarly disparaged another failed Cruz amendment this one to bar currently undocumented immigrants from ever being eligible for welfare benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps saying he doesn't think such an America is one he'd want to live in.  Sessions was also unsuccessful in his efforts to amend the bill offering 49 amendments and seeing nearly every one that went for a vote fail. On one amendment last week Sessions was the sole ""yes"" vote with all of his Republican colleagues abandoning him in his effort to limit legal immigration.  Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) was one of the rare Democrats to offer an amendment that the gang of eight took down. Schumer and Durbin told her they had to reluctantly oppose her attempt on Tuesday to add a change that would expand family visas so that people in extreme hardship could petition for green cards for their adult children or siblings. It failed with 7 votes in support and 11 against including Democrats Schumer Durbin and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) all of whom said it was a good amendment but would upset the delicate balance of the gang of eight bill.  ""Your heart's in the right place your amendment's in the wrong place"" Durbin said to Hirono. President Barack Obama applauded the committee for passing the bill. ""None of the Committee members got everything they wanted and neither did I but in the end we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line"" he said in a statement. ""I encourage the full Senate to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor at the earliest possible opportunity and remain hopeful that the amendment process will lead to further improvements."" Now that the bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee it has to go to the Senate floor where gang of eight members are hopeful it will pass. Schumer and McCain who is not on the Judiciary Committee have said they would like to win over a majority of both parties -- around 70 votes in total."
Washington Post,0,[Don’t let DOMA fool you — the Supreme Court is restricting your rights],David Cole is a professor of constitutional law and criminal justice at Georgetown University Law Center and a fellow at the Open Society Foundation.  The Supreme Court’s 5 to 4 decision to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act was undeniably historic a victory not just for gay rights advocates but for anyone committed to advancing equal rights in America.  It was also an anomaly.  For all the celebration Wednesday — and who will forget the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washingtonsinging the national anthem outside the court? — the underlying theme of the Supreme Court’s term was not the recognition of rights but their dilution. Time and again in closely divided decisions on issues as disparate as antitrust law privacy and discrimination the court either watered down rights or made it difficult or impossible to enforce them effectively. (Unless of course you are a white college applicant challenging affirmative action.)  In two cases the justices made it impossible for plaintiffs alleging serious violations of federal law even to have their claims heard. In Clapper v. Amnesty International the court denied a constitutional challenge to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 which vastly expanded the National Security Agency’s surveillance powers. This law authorizes the recently disclosed surveillance programs which involve the interception of international e-mails phone conversations and social-network communications. The act permits surveillance without having to show that the target is suspected of anything thereby jettisoning the bedrock requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs in Clapper included lawyers human rights advocates and journalists all of whom communicated frequently with people overseas whom the government was likely to be targeting under the statute and therefore had to take expensive and burdensome measures to preserve the confidentiality of their communications.   With a majority comprised of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. Anthony M. Kennedy Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs’ claims could not be heard because they could not show that they had actually been subjected to the surveillance. The catch: The surveillance is conducted in secret so no one can be certain that he or she is subject to it. In a second case  American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant  the same five justices ruled that corporations can insulate themselves from liability for violating federal law by inserting clauses in their contracts that prohibit class-action arbitration. A group of small merchants argued that American Express had violated antitrust laws by using its monopoly power to charge credit card fees 30 percent higher than those of its competitors. But American Express had used the same monopoly power to draft a form contract that directed all legal disputes into arbitration — and then forbade arbitration on a class-wide basis. The merchants argued that because antitrust claims are so expensive to prove they are not worth pursuing on an individual basis and can be vindicated only through collective class-wide proceedings. The Supreme Court previously ruled that contracts may require arbitration rather than court litigation only if the arbitration proceeding provides an adequate forum for individuals to vindicate their rights. In Italian Colors the court’s majority conceded that requiring individual arbitrations would make it too expensive to challenge American Express’s conduct but as Justice Elena Kagan paraphrased the majority’s response in her dissent: “Too darn bad.” In three other closely divided decisions the court’s conservative justices made equality rights decidedly harder to enforce. In Shelby County v. Holder the court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required select states with a history of discrimination to clear any changes in their voting arrangements with the federal government ahead of time by showing that the changes would not dilute the rights of minority voters. This preclearance requirement was the most effective part of the law because it prevented discriminatory actions from taking effect in the first place rather than requiring victims to later sue in court where challenges are often so expensive and time-consuming that they cannot adequately address many discriminatory voting practices. The court previously upheld the preclearance requirement four times but on Tuesday the conservative majority broke with years of precedent and concluded that the rights of states are more important than the equal voting rights of minority citizens. In a pair of less-noticed decisions released the day before Shelby County the court once again by 5 to 4votes issued employer-friendly worker-hostile interpretations of Title VII the section of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in employment. In both cases the court rejected long-standing interpretations of the law by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar the court imposed a more demanding standard on “retaliation” claims brought when an employer responds to a discrimination complaint by punishing the employee for raising the issue. And in Vance v. Ball State University the court narrowed the definition of “supervisors” under Title VII thereby reducing employers’ responsibility for racial and sexual harassment in the workplace. Title VII says employers are more responsible for harassment from supervisors than from co-workers and the EEOC had sensibly defined “supervisor” as a person with the authority to direct another’s daily work. But the court’s conservatives limited “supervisors” to those who have the formal authority to hire fire and grant or deny promotions a much narrower group. The ruling means that victims of harassment by supervisors who lack such formal authority will be significantly less protected. The justices also curtailed our rights against the police. In Maryland v. King the court ruled that the state can take DNA samples from arrestees without a warrant or any basis for suspicion. It reasoned that DNA samples like fingerprints are taken for identification purposes not to investigate a crime and so don’t have to meet the “individualized suspicion” standard that applies to investigatory searches. But as Justice Scalia pointed out in a dissent joined by Justices Kagan Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg DNA samples are not taken to identify arrestees but to investigate whether they are responsible for some other crime. The practice of taking DNA samples if strictly limited to identifying characteristics and not used to determine an individual’s genetic traits may seem reasonable enough as the intrusion is minor. But allowing sweeping searches without individualized suspicion runs contrary to the court’s long-standing Fourth Amendment rules. Meanwhile in Salinas v. Texas the court’s conservative majority ruled paradoxically that Americans’ right to remain silent won’t be protected unless they speak up. The court decided that if someone refuses to answer potentially incriminating questions it’s perfectly permissible for the state to use that refusal in a criminal trial as long as the questions were asked outside the trial or an interrogation in custody. The result is that individuals who believe they have a right to remain silent (having been so informed by countless television shows) and exercise it will be punished for doing so. Of course the high court was not uniformly hostile to individual rights. In addition to striking down the Defense of Marriage Act’s limits on federal marriage benefits it also gave a partial victory to Abigail Fisher a white applicant who challenged the University of Texas’s affirmative action plan; in that case the court compromised concluding that the lower courts had not subjected the university’s plan to sufficient scrutiny and sent the case back for further review. But of course that ruling issued in the name of equal protection actually limits efforts to remove barriers for minorities. The larger pattern is clear: This term the Roberts court regularly favored restricting people’s rights or more insidiously limiting their ability to enforce those rights. Almost all these rulings were 5 to 4 decisions most divided along familiar ideological lines. The close votes reflect the fact that there were reasonable arguments to be made on both sides. But courts play an essential role in safeguarding individual rights and in this term the Supreme Court repeatedly did the opposite. Congress could of course fix many of the problems through legislation — but leaving the protection of individual rights to a polarized and partisan institution offers cold comfort.
