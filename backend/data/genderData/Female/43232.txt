’  ’ ”   Democrats launched a highly promoted redistricting effort on   Thursday, hoping to target one of the party’s biggest failures in   the era of President Barack Obama. ” ’   Announced by former Attorney General Eric Holder, the   National Democratic Redistricting Committee is tasked with   strategizing how to gain advantages at the state level ahead of   the 2021 redrawing of the congressional district map. ’ ”   Ahead of the 2011 redistricting process, Republicans gained many   statehouse seats and governorships, helping to in turn gain an   advantage in the House. Because of the way the congressional map   is structured, many observers view 2022 as Democrats’ first   legitimate chance of taking back control of the body. ” ’   In the 2016 elections, of course, the Republican   Party managed to turn a clean sweep of both branches of   Congress and the presidency. ’ ’   In a speech Thursday from the Center for American Progress,   Holder outlined the three biggest priorities for the group, with   which Obama will be involved: getting Democrats elected at the   state level in a series of targeted states, homing in on legal   strategies, and gaining support for state ballot initiatives. ’ ’   ”This redistricting process will be critical to the future of our   democracy,” Holder said. ”Those who control state governments   draw the lines that shape Congress for the next decade. Fixing   this redistricting problem will involve not just focusing on the   lines, but focusing on the larger effort to win back governance.   This is the path to ensuring Democrats have their rightful seats   at the table in 2021.” ’
