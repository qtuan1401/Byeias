Per a Fox 25 Boston report, a picture of a young child giving a Springfield, MA police officer the finger has gone viral.  The child’s dad reportedly taught his son to give police officers the finger. The photo was posted just days after two   men were killed by law enforcement and five Dallas, TX police were killed in an attack. Sgt. John Delaney with the Springfield Police Department reacted to the picture, saying, “I would go and rescue that little boy if he was drowning, if he was in a car accident, if he was choking on something, and I would do that and not ask for thanks. And there are 400 other police officers in the city of Springfield that would do the same. ” According to Delaney, the Springfield Police Department has received “an outpouring of support. A large crowd of people reportedly joined together in a peaceful march to the Springfield federal courthouse. “Over the last week, we’ve seen an outpouring of support from the public,” Delaney told Fox 25.
