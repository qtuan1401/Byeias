An insider told the paper that staffers at the network are upset that NBC would make significant changes to its Today lineup, given the show’s strong ratings over the last several months.

The third hour was beating every syndicated show across the board,” the insider told Page Six. “They were in over their head and bit off more than they can chew when they hired Megyn. ” Another insider told the paper that “everyone has been left in the dark” regarding the changes. Page Six also reported that Hall is expected to leave NBC next month when her contract expires.

In the absence of The Kelly File, Fox News moved Tucker Carlson into Kelly’s old 9 p. m. primetime slot and gave Martha McCallum the 7 p. m. slot with a new show, The First 100 Days. In its first two weeks, Tucker Carlson Tonight has averaged nearly double the ratings for The Kelly File over the same time period last year in the     demographic.
