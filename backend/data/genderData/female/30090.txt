Lions Gate released the first teaser for Deepwater Horizon on Wednesday, which is based on events surrounding the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  The film, which stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, Kate Hudson, and John Malkovich, is set on the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, which experienced a blowout in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico and created the worst oil spill in U. S. history. While the teaser mainly focuses on the young daughter of Wahlberg and Hudson, it also shows several scenes recreating the disaster, which occurred on April 20, 2010, resulting in explosions and fires onboard the rig. In the trailer, the couple’s daughter describes oil as a “monster” during a dramatic recreation of oil drilling gone awry using a soda can. Eleven men were killed in the Deepwater Horizon accident, which left oil and methane gas spewing from an uncapped wellhead for 87 days. A judge later ruled BP was responsible for the release of 3. 1 million barrels of oil into the Gulf. The federal government estimated the damage was closer to 4. 2 million barrels. Deepwater Horizon is expected to premiere September 30.
