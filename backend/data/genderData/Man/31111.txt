A U. S. Border Patrol agent has been killed in a car crash in the remote Texas county of Hudspeth. [The accident happened in the Big Bend Sector. The area has long stretches of highways and agents in many areas of Texas have long voiced concerns over the long distances some of them must travel to reach the area where they are assigned while coping with often incoherent work schedules. It is not known at this time if the issues that prompted these concerns from agents played a role in the accident.  The Hudspeth County Sheriffâ€™s Department did not want to comment on the matter, however, an El Paso news outlet claims the sheriff confirmed that an accident had occurred without confirming an agent was involved.
