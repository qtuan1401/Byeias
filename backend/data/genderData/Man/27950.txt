This morning it was announced that Islamist extremists will be housed in separate units after a review found that preachers were radicalizing the wider Muslim population while incarcerated. [The same review also found that political correctness was responsible for allowing Islamic extremism and hate to spread in UK prisons, as the Telegraph reports today.  Political correctness in prisons is allowing extremism to flourish because guards are too afraid of confronting Muslims, a report has found. A review into Islamist extremism in the British justice system has found that “cultural sensitivity” towards Muslim prisoners is preventing staff “challenging unacceptable extremist behaviour and views”. The report, by Ian Acheson, a former prison governor, warns that supervising staff are being “pressured” to leave prayer rooms during collective worship. Islamist prisoners are also attempting to prevent searches by “claiming dress is religious” and are also getting access to extremist literature that is available in chaplaincy libraries or from individual prisoners. Mr Acheson’s report concluded that extremists are “exploiting  …    staff fear of being labelled racist”. It also warned that “charismatic Islamist extremist prisoners [are] acting as   ‘emirs’ and exerting a controlling and radicalising influence of the wider Muslim prison population”. The Government has said that it will implement a number of the report’s recommendations. Liz Truss, the Justice Secretary, has already announced that the most dangerous extremists will be locked up in isolated   prisons within prisons to prevent them from radicalising other inmates. On Monday, she will also announce that governors and prison officers will be given new training to “prevent influential extremist prisoners exerting control and radicalising others”.
