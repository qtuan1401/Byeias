MSNBC National Correspondent Joy Reid stated that conservatives “almost infantilize” women by saying they wouldn’t punish them for having abortions if abortion was criminalized on Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Hardball. ”  Reid said, “[T]he doctrine has you don’t make the subtext of the   movement into text. You don’t take it to its logical conclusion, you know, other than Richard Mourdock and Akin, and some of these guys who make a mistake, you’re not supposed to give away the game that the idea is that you want to completely criminalize abortion. You sort almost infantilize the woman and say, no, she’s a victim. We just want to criminalize the provider. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
