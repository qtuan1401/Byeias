D’Angelo Russell may be persona non grata around his Lakers teammates. But one Laker WAG really appreciates him. [hmmm i see D Angelo Russell is trending  …     I actually liked his film. Thanks bro.  —   IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) March 30, 2016, The second pick in last year’s NBA draft surreptitiously recorded teammate Nick Young boasting of his sexual exploits. Young remains, at least at this point, engaged to Aussie rapper Iggy Azalea.  The phone video shot by Russell somehow made its way to a gossip website. The rookie’s teammates immediately began shunning him. ESPN reports that when Russell recently sat down next to Lou Williams in the locker room the veteran immediately walked away and at a breakfast meeting in Salt Lake City no Laker would sit at the rookie’s table. “It’s bad,” a team source told ESPN. “It’s about as bad as it can get. There were trust issues already. Now there’s no trust. ” Ms. Azalea knows the feeling.
