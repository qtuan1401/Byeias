A Brazilian man was arrested on Sunday evening after he tried to extinguish the Olympic flame by throwing a bucket of water on it.  Marcelino Mateus Silva Proenca missed the torch and instead doused the torch bearer and the security guards surrounding him. Proenca was standing on the sidewalk when he tried to extinguish the torch. Proenca told Brazilian police that he was acting on a dare. Last week, Proenca reportedly posted a photo on his Facebook page “of a man holding a bucket with a caption that read: ‘Waiting for the torch to pass. ’”
