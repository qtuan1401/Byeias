Pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday, “There are conflicts all over the place”regarding Hillary Clinton’s ongoing email scandal, which Caddell compared it to the Watergate scandal of the Nixon era. [“Do you want a President who is under investigation from day one?” asked Caddell, pointing out that the email scandal could easily consume any Clinton presidency, just as Watergate did to Nixon’s.  “Last night on Political Insiders on Fox, ” continued Caddell, “my colleague Doug Schoen, who had been for Hillary Clinton, stunned everyone by saying he could no longer consider supporting her because if she were elected, there would be a constitutional crisis. I then equated the situation to Watergate in 1973. ” Added Caddell, “This investigation cannot go away,” pointing out that if there is confidential or classified government emails among the 650, 000 or so discovered on a laptop belonging to former Congressman Anthony Weiner and his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, that alone could be a crime. If someone without a clearance is in possession of that type of information, “that’s a felony,” said Caddell. He went on to discuss at length the conflicts between Clinton, President Obama, and the Justice Department. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
