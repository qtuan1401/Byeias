The Holocaust Museum in Washington, D. C. is attempting to get the area removed from augmented reality game Pokémon Go, after numerous players have been crowding at the location in an attempt to catch Pokémon. [The museum, like many other different national landmarks, has become a PokéStop since the U. S. release of Pokémon Go last Thursday. This means that players who gather at the area can acquire free items, as well as having the usual opportunity at catching Pokémon.  “Playing the game is not appropriate in the museum, which is a memorial to the victims of Nazism  …     We are trying to find out if we can get the museum excluded from the game,” said museum communications director Andrew Hollinger to the Washington Post. “It’s not like we came here to play  …     But gotta catch ’em all,” said one player who was attempting to catch Pokémon at the Holocaust Museum. Another player even claimed to have found “Koffing,” the game’s poisonous gas Pokémon, at the site. Pokémon Go has faced some criticism since its recent launch in the U. S. as the game has even been used by criminals to lure, find, and rob people in quiet areas. Four teenagers were arrested and charged in Missouri after the gang was found armed after robbing their victims using the app. One    girl from Wyoming even stumbled across a dumped human corpse after she climbed a fence in an attempt to catch a Pokémon on the other side. Other players have reported that the   Memorial and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier have also been labelled as Pokémon Go hotspots. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
