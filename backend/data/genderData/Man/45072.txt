’  ’ ’   J. Crew chief executive and chairman Mickey Drexler is leaving his   position as CEO after 14 years in the role. ’ ’   Drexler will be succeeded by West Elm CEO Jim Brett, the company   announced Monday. Drexler will remain chairman of the company. ’ ”   J. Crew’s sales have been plunging for years. ” ’  ’ ’   J. Crew also recently parted ways with its longtime   creative director, Jenna Lyons. ’ ”   In a recent  Drexler said the retailer’s   biggest mistake over the last several years is that it jacked up   its prices at a time when customers were increasingly    . ” ’   ”We gave a perception of being a   company than we   were  —   in our catalog, online, and in our general presentation,”   Drexler told The Journal. ”Very big mistake.” ’ ’   At the height of the Great Recession in 2008, J. Crew unveiled a     line, called J. Crew Collection. ’ ’   The line, spearheaded by Jenna Lyons, at the time the head   designer, debuted with a store on Madison Avenue in New York   City. It featured items such as a $3, 000 jacket ”with French   sequins in various shades of tortoiseshell   into silk   chiffon,” the now defunct magazine Portfolio wrote at the time. ’ ’   The higher prices alienated customers when they were strapped for   cash and increasingly shopping at discount stores. ’ ’   ”We became a little too elitist in our attitude,” Drexler told   The Journal. ’ ’  ’ ’   In December, J. Crew was selling several of its Collection items   at . The website now   features a  of Collection items, many of which are   under $200. ’ ”   Drexler has also attributed the company’s losses to numerous   fashion misses. ” ’   Drexler is now trying to turn the business around by putting an   emphasis on lowering prices and becoming a more ”approachable”   brand, he said. ’ ’   ”We’’re getting back to being who we are  —   much more comfortable,   approachable, democratic, and friendly,” he told The Journal. ’ ’J.
