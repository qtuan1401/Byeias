      "1,2294:'WASHINGTON  The Republicanled House of Representatives approved a farreaching bill to ban a womans ability to seek an abortion after  weeks on a mostly partyline  vote Tuesday It stands no chance of becoming law under the Obama administration The White House issued a veto threat Monday calling the bill an assault on a womans right to choose The Democratic Senate also has not scheduled a vote on the legislation However House Speaker John Boehner ROhio justified the vote as a response to the recent murder conviction of Philadelphia physician Kermit Gosnell for abortion procedures conducted in his medical clinic Listen after this Kermit Gosnell trial and some of the horrific acts that were going on the vast majority of the American people believe in the substance of this bill and so do I Boehner said The bill included an exemption for women who get pregnant through rape or incest as long as they first report the sexual assault to legal authorities It was added at the last minute by House Republican leaders after a broader Democratic amendment to add the exemption was defeated in the House Judiciary Committee last week It shows a distrust of women and a lack of the reality of sexual assaults said Rep Zoe Lofgren DCalif regarding the legal conditions placed on the exemption The legislation stirred a heated debate in the House The majority of Democrats opposed the legislation and argued that House Republicans  of whom are white males were out of touch with women Rep Trent Franks RAriz the sponsor of the bill and a longtime abortion rights opponent was a target of criticism last week when he commented in a June  committee hearing on the bill that the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy is very low He later said he meant that thirdtrimester abortions of pregnancies caused by rape are rare Republicans tapped a woman Rep Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee to moderate the House floor debate although she does not serve on the Judiciary Committee that has jurisdiction over the legislation There are no Republican women on that panel Another Republican woman Rep Ileana RosLehtinen of Florida presided over the debate Democrats also tapped a female lawmaker Judiciary Committee member Lofgren to lead the debate for their party This is an area that has overwhelming public support Blackburn said This is a step that needs to be taken to protect life The debate invigorated outside groups and activists on both sides of the abortion debate Penny Nance president of Concerned Women for America called it the most important prolife bill to be considered by the US Congress in the last  years and expressed confidence that it would eventually become law NARAL ProChoice America President Ilyse Hogue called the bill shameless politics and accused abortion opponents in Congress of catering to the most extreme wing of their political base Most states allow abortions up to the point when the fetus becomes viable generally considered to be about  weeks of pregnancy Franks bill would ban abortions that take place  weeks after conception which is equivalent to  weeks of pregnancy Ten states have passed laws similar to the House bill and several are facing court challenges Last month a federal court struck down as unconstitutional Arizonas law which differs slightly in banning abortion  weeks after pregnancy rather than conception According to the Guttmacher Institute a New Yorkbased reproductive health research organization that supports abortion rights in   of the  million abortions in the country about  occurred  weeks after the fetus was conceived Contributing The Associated Press',1234:WASHINGTON  President Obama is no stranger to talking about race As the nations first AfricanAmerican president Obamas racial identity has remained frontandcenter through the first  years of his presidency Hes spoken of his own improbable story as evidence of how far the nation has come even as hes battled with detractors who have spoken of his otherness as a handicap to leading the nation When the president steps to the dais at the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday to deliver remarks marking the th anniversary of the March on Washington he will undoubtedly note that his own rise connects directly to the blood tears and work of Martin Luther King Jrand his civil rights contemporaries Over the years his most compelling remarks on race stretch from reflections as a young man grappling with his identity to his thoughts last month after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of AfricanAmerican teenager Trayvon Martin Some of these comments have been lauded by his supporters as thoughtful and heartfelt while others have derided them as divisive rhetoric that stoke the nations continued racial divide July  Dreams from My Father A Story of Race and Inheritance Before launching his political career Obama penned a book delving into his own journey as the son of a black African father and white American mother The emotions between the races could never be pure even love was tarnished by the desire to find in the other some element that was missing in ourselves Whether we sought out our demons or salvation the other race would always remain just that menacing alien and apart March   Selma Ala The then longshot presidential candidate Sen Barack Obama spoke from the pulpit of the historic Brown Chapel AME Church of his own claim to a place in the civil rights movement Im here because somebody marched Im here because you all sacrificed for me I stand on the shoulders of giants I thank the Moses generation but weve got to remember now that Joshua still had a job to do  March   Philadelphia After video of Obamas former pastor Jeremiah Wright making a series of racially controversial statements surfaced in the heat of the presidential race Obama spoke about race in the USA I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother  a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe These people are a part of me And they are a part of America this country that I love July   news conference About six months into his first term Obama was asked during a primetime news conference about the arrest of Henry Louis Gates a noted AfricanAmerican scholar who was arrested outside his own home I dont know not having been there and not seeing all the facts what role race played in that Gates case But I think its fair to say number one any of us would be pretty angry number two that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home and number three what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that theres a long history in this country of African Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately Thats just a fact  March   Washington President Obama weighed in on the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin for the first time more than a month after the killing had spurred a national uproar My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin You know if I had a son hed look like Trayvon All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves May   at Morehouse College Atlanta Obama delivered the commencement address at Morehouse the countrys preeminent historically black college and the alma mater of King Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices And I have to say growing up I made quite a few myself Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is theres no longer any room for excuses July   Washington After George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin Obama tried to explain African Americans response When Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me  years ago  When you think about why in the AfricanAmerican community at least theres a lot of pain Its important to recognize that the AfricanAmerican community is looking at this issue through a set

      "3,735:'The premiums for coverage available on the health insurance exchanges created by President Barack Obamas health care reform law will vary widely from state to state according to a new Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of data published by  states and the District of Columbia Retail prices for health insurance can be considerably different based in part on the cost of health care services where a person lives even within the same state the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Wednesday Premiums also vary based on age family size and tobacco use But under Obamacare prices cannot be based on someones medical history and patients with preexisting condition cannot be turned away The law also mandates a set of minimum benefits that includes hospitalizations prescription drugs and maternity care The prices included in the report dont include health benefits provided by employers because the health insurance exchanges are intended for the uninsured and those who dont get jobbased health plans The actual premiums for the health plans on the exchanges have been a chief unknown since Obama enacted the health care law in  and although complete information wont be available until the exchanges open the Kaiser Family Foundation examined detailed data published by state authorities to create a snapshot of what coverage will cost In Baltimore a yearold will be able to buy a socalled bronze health insurance plan for as little as  a month compared to  a month in Burlington Vt not including the savings from tax credits available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level   for a single person this year  according to the report The health insurance exchanges in all  states and the District of Columbia are slated to open Oct  for small businesses uninsured people and for people who dont get health benefits at work to comparison shop and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance People who get health benefits from large employers or who are enrolled in government programs like Medicare dont need to use the exchanges Employers provide coverage to  million US residents according to census data and virtually all large firms are expected to continue doing so next year despite the Obama administrations oneyear delay of the laws requirement that large companies cover workers or pay a penalty The exchanges will sell four tiers of health insurance  bronze silver gold and platinum  indicating how generous the coverage is Bronze plans will tend to have the lowest premiums but expose consumers to the highest possible outofpocket costs and platinum plans will have the highest prices but the lowest additional expenses Those younger than  can purchase socalled catastrophic insurance with minimal coverage at a lower price but cannot apply federal tax credits to these plans  The Kaiser Family Foundation didnt compare the premiums on the health insurance exchange with the cost of health insurance for those who dont get health benefits at work today however The new laws guaranteed benefits prohibition against turning down people with preexisting conditions will make health insurance on this market too different from whats currently available the report says These changes make direct comparisons of exchange premiums and existing individual market premiums complicated and doing so would require speculative assumptions and data that are not publicly available it says Some people most likely young adults who dont qualify for financial assistance may see higher prices as a result The variation isnt limited to bronze plans the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis reveals The lowest cost exchange silver exchange plan available range in cost for a yearold from  per month in Portland Oregon to  per month for a yearold in Burlington Vermont before tax credits the report says  Under Obamacare people whose incomes range from poverty  for a single person this year and  percent of poverty may be eligible for tax credits to buy private insurance Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges while the federal government will at least partly manage exchanges also called marketplaces in the remaining states  Most people buying their own insurance will qualify for premium tax credits which will significantly lower the cost of their premiums the Kaiser Family Foundation report says The foundation also notes that premiums released so far are lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office People who earn up to  percent of poverty or  for an individual this year can enroll in Medicaid if they live in the District of Columbia or one of the  states that are expanding the program under the law  The Kaiser Family Foundation examined insurance company filings to state regulators in  states and the District of Columbia and analyzed the prices in the largest cities in each jurisdiction for people at ages   and  At least two health insurance companies are offering products in all of the locations included in the report California has the largest number of companies participating in its exchange Covered California at  while HealthSource RI in Rhode Island and Maines federally run marketplace each have two companies   Source Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation Eligibility for tax credits via the exchanges is determined based on the maximum amount of a persons income they must spend on health insurance and the price of the secondcheapest silverlevel health insurance plan where they live In addition to the tax credits for annual premiums people who earn up to twoandahalf times poverty can qualify for additional subsidies to cover their outofpocket costs like copayments and deductibles Most legal residents of the United States must obtain coverage or face a tax penalty under the laws individual mandate  Source Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation The full Kaiser Family Foundation report includes breakdowns for each example in every one of the metropolitan areas examined',82:WASHINGTON  The Michigan Republican Party is seeking to increase its visibility in Democratic and minorityheavy Detroit and last week it brought Sen Rand Paul RKy to the city to open the partys AfricanAmerican Engagement Office But if anything the launch event put into stark relief just how much work the GOP has to do when a largely white audience turned out to hear the senator speak Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus has said that attracting more minorities to the GOP is crucial for the partys future He visited Michigan last month hired radio personality Wayne Bradley to head the AfricanAmerican Engagement effort in the state and launched the Michigan Black Advisory Council  In the  election President Barack Obama earned the support of  percent of the black voters who turned out at the polls Paul initially spoke at the new AfricanAmerican Engagement Office on Livernois Avenue in Detroit for about four minutes on Friday According to the progressive site Eclectablog The seats in the tiny space were filled with welldressed supporters most of whom were AfricanAmerican  Todays opening of this office is the beginning of a new Republican Party Paul said This is going to be a Republican Party that is in big cities and small cities in the countryside in the city Its going to be about bringing a message that is popular no matter where youre from whether youre rich or poor whether youre black white or brown Paul then went to a larger grassroots event at the Grace Bible Chapel where there were protesters from the civil rights group National Action Network outside The online invitation said the event was intended to celebrate the opening of our AfricanAmerican Engagement Office in Detroit Tracking footage from the Democratic super PAC American Bridge st Century however shows an overwhelmingly white audience ended up turning out  Detroit is approximately  percent AfricanAmerican Paul also spoke Friday at the Detroit Economic Club where he proposed a plan to revitalize US cities through the creation of economic freedom zones which would cut federal taxes in communities that have an unemployment rate of  percent or higher  The Michigan Democratic Party rejected Pauls advice for Detroit Sen Paul was a vocal opponent of the auto rescue which saved over a million jobs and led the Republican effort to shut down the government costing Michigans economy hundreds of millions said party spokesman Joshua Pugh His special interest tax handout plan is nothing new Here in Michigan Rick Snyder gave  billion to wealthy special interests and paid for it with billions in devastating cuts to our local communities and public schools Its time for our elected leaders to stop the tax giveaways invest in communities and improve education Paul has been trying to do more minority outreach in recent months In April Paul spoke at the historically black Howard University becoming the first Republican elected official to speak on campus in years  Still he continues to generate skepticism in part due to his criticism of the  Civil Rights Act In  he said I think its a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant but at the same time I do believe in private ownership On Sunday Paul said he opposed extending longterm unemployment benefits because doing so would be a disservice to

      "4,3194:'Jonathan Serrie reports from Charleston South Carolina With no incumbent the field was wide open for both novice and experienced politicians to enter the race for South Carolinas Republicanleaning st Congressional District The candidates have poured in two Democrats and  Republicans are running Mark Sanford who represented this district for three terms in the US House from  to  before being elected governor in  is the GOP frontrunner Handpainted campaign signs underscore his reputation as a fiscal conservative Folks have had a lot of fun with it said Sanford also a former Fox News contributor Ultimately campaigns are about messages And its certainly a reinforcement of what people have come to know about me for  years Sanfords apparent lead comes less than four years after he secretly left the country for an extramarital affair Several days into his  disappearance Sanford announced through a spokesman that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail But when confronted by reporters upon his return he admitted he had actually been in Argentina visiting his mistress Maria Belen Chapur The revelation ultimately ended Sanfords marriage At the time many thought it would also end his political career Sanford was among them I for all the obvious reasons  thought that politics was forever over for me said Sanford whos now engaged to Chapur But when the District  vacancy arose Sanford said friends convinced him he had a rare opportunity to do something about spending in Washington using everything he had learned at the statehouse on Capitol Hill and even from his personal scandal If you go through the experience that I went through it humbles you Sanford said And I think that if theres anything thats needed in Washington DC right now its a little bit greater level of humility from either partys perspective in where theyre coming from While Sanford runs on his experience fellow Republican Teddy Turner the son of billionaire media mogul and CNN founder Ted Turner is running against the political establishment We cant send more politicians to Washington Turner said Its the definition of insanity  doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result As a high school economics teacher Turner is no career politician However his family name recognition is a mixed blessing for a Republican trying to distance himself from his fathers liberal views Ive had a lot of access to a lot of great things in my life because of my father Turner said That part is a huge asset I am who I am because of him But in a political race it makes it a lot more difficult because people assume they know who you are Just they hear the name They assume And they also assume unfortunately that Im liberal Turner is not the only candidate with a famous family member On the Democratic side political satirist and comedian Stephen Colbert is bringing his star power to the campaign of his sister Elizabeth Colbert Busch With  brothers and sisters youd better learn how to negotiate Colbert Busch told reporters at a recent campaign event Colbert Busch faces an uphill battle running as a Democrat in a district that favors Republicans However her career in maritime trade and involvement in economic development initiatives have earned the respect of many in the business community according to Kendra Stewart a political science professor at the College of Charleston Theres a lot of Yankee Republicans in this district who are more concerned with fiscal issues than social issues Stewart said So they would be much more willing to consider a candidate who wasnt terribly leftleaning but was a Democrat who had good business values and maybe a little more fiscally conservative Colbert Busch has another advantage in that she faces only one Democratic challenger in the March  special primary perennial candidate Ben Frasier But with  contenders vying for the GOP nomination its unlikely any Republican will pass the  percent of the vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff on April  Colbert Busch can step back and save all her money and watch the Republicans slug it out while she capitalizes on their attacks on each other Stewart said We need to pass a budget said Republican candidate Larry Grooms who currently serves in the South Carolina State Senate It needs to be a responsible budget And we need to learn to live within our budget Thats not happening in Washington All the candidates agree fiscal responsibility is a key issue in this race The debate is over which candidate is uniquely qualified to make it happen in Washington Other candidates in the Republican field include environmental consultant Keith Blandford former Charleston County Councilman Curtis Bostic engineer Ric Bryant military prosecutor Jonathan Hoffman systems engineer Jeff King former State Sen John Kuhn defense contractor Tim Larkin State Rep Chip Limehouse State Rep Peter McCoy Charleston County school board member Elizabeth Moffly former Dorchester County Sheriff Ray Nash State Rep and former Secret Service agent Andy Patrick and attorney Shawn Pinkston I believe in duty said Pinkston an Army veteran who served in Iraq I believe in putting the countrys interest above my own The winners of South Carolinas st District primaries will face each other in a general election on May  Jonathan Serrie joined Fox News Channel FNC in April  and currently serves as a correspondent based in the Atlanta bureau',59:FILE March   In this photo on the Twitter account of  Ariz GOP Sen John McCain he and Sen Charles Schumer DNY left stand with US Border Patrol agents in Nogales Ariz AP The deal was brokered by New York Democratic Sen Chuck Schumer who also was on the phone call and is one of eight senators working on bipartisan reform legislation This issue has always been the dealbreaker on immigration reform but not this time Schumer said The strength of the consensus across America for just reform has afforded us the momentum needed to forge an agreement in principle to develop a new type of employer visa system Trumka said in a statement late Saturday We expect that this new program which benefits not just business but everyone will promote long overdue reforms by raising the bar for existing programs Despite the breakthrough Florida Republican Sen Marco Rubios office cautioned Saturday that Congress still has a long way to go before passing legislation in the Democratcontrolled Senate and the Republicancontrolled House Rubio sent a letter Saturday to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy DVt calling for a deliberate hearing process on the new legislation and cautioning against a rush to legislate Senate negotiators are making good progress on immigration reform but were not done yet Rubio press secretary Alex Conant tweeted Saturday White House spokesman Clark Stevens said Obama continues to be encouraged by the progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators We look forward to seeing language once it is introduced and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible he said A source told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity the deal resolves disagreements over wages for new lowincome workers and which industries would be included All members of the socalled Gang of Eight are expected to sign off on the agreement The remaining big hurdles to passage are securing the US borders cracking down on employers who hire illegally and creating a pathway to citizenship for  million illegal immigrants already in the country The bipartisan group is expected to introduce the bill officially the week of April  after Congress returns from a twoweek recess The AFLCIO and the Chamber had been fighting over wages for tens of thousands of lowskilled workers who would be brought in under the new program to fill jobs in construction hotels and resorts nursing homes and restaurants and other industries On Friday officials from both sides said there was basic agreement on the wage issue and Schumer said a final deal on the worker dispute was very close Were feeling very optimistic on immigration Aspiring Americans will receive the road map to citizenship they deserve and we can modernize future flow without reducing wages for any local workers regardless of what papers they carry AFLCIO spokesman Jeff Hauser said in a statement earlier this week Future flow refers to future arrivals of legal immigrants Under the emerging agreement between business and labor a new W visa program would bring tens of thousands of lowerskilled workers a year to the country The program would be capped at  a year but the number of visas would fluctuate depending on unemployment rates job openings employer demand and data collected by a new federal bureau pushed by the labor movement as an objective monitor of the market The workers would be able to change jobs and could seek permanent residency Under current temporary worker programs personnel cant move from employer to employer and have no path to permanent US residence and citizenship And currently theres no good way for employers to bring many lowskilled workers to the US An existing visa program for lowwage nonagricultural workers is capped at  per year and is supposed to apply only to seasonal or temporary jobs The Chamber of Commerce said workers would earn actual wages paid to American workers or the prevailing wages for the industry theyre working in whichever is higher The Labor Department determines prevailing wage based on customary rates in specific localities so that it varies from city to city The lowskilled worker issue had loomed for weeks as perhaps the toughest matter to settle in monthslong closeddoor talks on immigration among the senators including Republicans John McCain Arizona and Rubio The issue helped sink the last major attempt at immigration overhaul in  when the legislation foundered on the Senate floor after an amendment was added to end a temporary worker program after five years threatening a key priority of the business community The amendment passed by just one vote  Obama a senator at the time joined in the narrow majority

train wreck were told consumers will face a terrible shock Republicans one hears are already counting on the laws troubles to give them a big electoral advantage No doubt there will be problems as there are with any large new government initiative and in this case we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform Yet important new evidence  especially from California the laws most important test case  suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success Before I can explain what the news means I need to make a crucial point Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform not in a political sense although it was originally a Republican proposal but in terms of leaving most peoples health care unaffected Americans who receive health insurance from their employers Medicare or Medicaid  which is to say the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all  will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect There are however millions of Americans who dont receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs They can get insurance only by buying it on their own and many of them are effectively shut out of that market In some states like California insurers reject applicants with past medical problems In others like New York insurers cant reject applicants and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history community rating unfortunately this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured Obamacare closes this gap with a threepart approach First community rating everywhere  no more exclusion based on preexisting conditions Second the mandate  you must buy insurance even if youre currently healthy Third subsidies to make insurance affordable for those with lower incomes Massachusetts has had essentially this system since  as a result nearly all residents have health insurance and the program remains very popular So we know that Obamacare  or as some of us call it ObamaRomneyCare  can work Skeptics argued however that Massachusetts was special it had relatively few uninsured residents even before the reform and it already had community rating What would happen elsewhere In particular what would happen in California where more than a fifth of the nonelderly population is uninsured and the individual insurance market is largely unregulated Would there be sticker shock as the price of individual policies soared Well the California bids are in  that is insurers have submitted the prices at which they are willing to offer coverage on the states newly created Obamacare exchange And the prices it turns out are surprisingly low A handful of healthy people may find themselves paying more for coverage but it looks as if Obamacares first year in California is going to be an overwhelmingly positive experience What can still go wrong Well Obamacare is a complicated program basically because simpler options like Medicare for all werent considered politically feasible So there will probably be a lot of administrative confusion as the law goes into effect again especially in states where Republicans have been doing their best to sabotage the process  Also some people are too poor to afford coverage even with the subsidies These Americans were supposed to be covered by a federally financed expansion of Medicaid but in states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion such unfortunates will be left out in the cold Still heres what it seems is about to happen millions of Americans will suddenly gain health coverage and millions more will feel much more secure knowing that such coverage is available if they lose their jobs or suffer other misfortunes Only a relative handful of people will be hurt at all And as contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it the sheer meanspiritedness of the Obamacare opponents will become ever more obvious So yes it does look as if theres an Obamacare shock coming the shock of learning that a public program designed to help a lot of people can strange to say end up helping a lot of people  especially when government officials actually try to make it work',423:The Affordable Care Act a k a Obamacare goes fully into effect at the beginning of next year and

      "9,36:'WASHINGTON  President Obama expanding his push to curtail severe penalties in drug cases on Thursday commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates who were convicted of crack cocaine offenses Each inmate has been imprisoned for at least  years and six were sentenced to life in prison It was the first time retroactive relief was provided to a group of inmates who would most likely have received significantly shorter terms if they had been sentenced under current drug laws sentencing rules and charging policies Most will be released in  days The commutations opened a major new front in the administrations efforts to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and to help correct what it has portrayed as inequality in the justice system  In a statement Mr Obama said that each of the eight men and women had been sentenced under what is now recognized as an unfair system including a to sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses that was significantly reduced by the Fair Sentencing Act of  If they had been sentenced under the current law many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society Mr Obama said Instead because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust they remain in prison separated from their families and their communities at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year The commutations have come during a pendulum swing away from tough mandatory minimum sentencing laws enacted a generation ago amid the crack epidemic The policies fueled an  percent increase in the number of prisoners in the United States They also carried a racial charge Offenses involving crack which was disproportionately prevalent in impoverished black communities carried far more severe penalties than those for powder cocaine favored by affluent white users According to Families Against Mandatory Minimums about  federal inmates are serving time for crack offenses committed before Congress reduced mandatory minimum sentences going forward in the  law The commutation recipients included Clarence Aaron of Mobile Ala who was sentenced to three life terms in prison for his role in a  drug deal when he was  Mr Aarons case has been taken up by civil rights groups and congressional critics of severe sentencing for nonviolent drug offenses and has receivedsignificant news mediaattention  Margaret Love his lawyer said she received a call informing her of the decision on Thursday morning and called her client who along with his family was very grateful He was absolutely overcome Ms Love said Actually I was too He was in tears This has been a long haul for him  years He just was speechless and its very exciting Rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union which had profiled several of the recipients in a recent report on nonviolent offenders serving life sentences greeted the announcement with praise and calls for additional efforts  Reaction among conservatives who in states like Texas and South Carolina have been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders was muted The top Republicans on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees declined to comment The commutation recipients also included Reynolds Wintersmith of Rockford Ill who was  in  when he was sentenced to life in prison for dealing crack and Stephanie George of Pensacola Fla who received a life sentence in  when she was  for hiding a boyfriends stash of crack in a box in her house In both cases the judges criticized the mandatory sentences they were required to impose calling them unjust In December  The New York Times published an article about Ms Georges case and the larger rethinking of the social and economic costs of long prison terms for nonviolent offenders Mr Obama mentioned the article in an interview with Time magazine that day and said he was considering asking officials about ways to do things smarter Around that time a senior White House official said Mr Obama directed Kathryn Ruemmler his White House counsel to ask the Justice Department to examine pending clemency petitions to assess whether there were any in which current inmates serving long sentences would have benefited from subsequent changes to sentencing laws and policy The deputy attorney general James M Cole who oversees the pardon office worked on the policy shift and ultimately returned the eight cases with positive recommendations from the department the official said In  there was bipartisan support in Congress for reducing the disparity in sentences between crack and powder cocaine against a backdrop of crime rates that have plunged to the lowest levels in four decades And in August Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr instructed prosecutors to omit listing any quantities of illicit substances in indictments for lowlevel drug offenses in order to avoid triggering mandatory minimum sentences  But those moves have left unanswered what if anything to do about federal inmates serving lengthy sentences for crack offenses committed before the Fair Sentencing Act A bill cosponsored by Senator Richard J Durbin Democrat of Illinois and Mike Lee Republican of Utah would make the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive for some offenders allowing inmates to apply to a judge for a review of whether a reduced sentence would be appropriate  The Obama administration supports that bill the White House said on Thursday as an orderly way to ensure casebycase analysis in addressing the broader problem  In the new year lawmakers should act on the kinds of bipartisan sentencing reform measures already working their way through Congress Mr Obama said Together we must ensure that our taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and that our justice system keeps its basic promise of equal treatment for all Mr Obama who has made relatively little use of his constitutional clemency powers to forgive offenses or reduce sentences also pardoned  people who completed their sentences long ago Those cases involved mostly minor offenses in line with his previous pardons',37:In  Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act which reduced the vast disparity in the way the federal courts punish crack versus powder cocaine offenses Instead of treating  grams of cocaine the same as  gram of crack for sentencing purposes the law cut the ratio to  to  Initially the law applied only to future offenders but a year later the United States Sentencing Commission voted to apply it retroactively Republicans raged charging that crime would go up and that prisoners would overwhelm the courts with frivolous demands for sentence reductions Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said the commission was pursuing a liberal agenda at all costs  This week we began to learn that there are no costs only benefits According to a preliminary report released by the commission more than  federal prisoners have had their sentences shortened under the law The average reduction is  months meaning that over all offenders are serving roughly  years fewer than they otherwise would have And since the federal government spends about  per year to house an inmate this reduction alone is worth nearly halfabillion dollars  big money for a Bureau of Prisons with a  billion budget In addition the commission found no significant difference in recidivism rates between those prisoners who were released early and those who served their full sentences  Federal judges nationwide have long expressed vigorous disagreement with both the sentencing disparity and the mandatory minimum sentences they are forced to impose both of which have been drivers of our bloated federal prison system But two bipartisan bills in Congress now propose a cheaper and more humane approach It would include reducing mandatory minimums giving judges more flexibility to sentence below those minimums and making more inmates eligible for reductions to their sentences under the new ratio But  to  is still out of whack The ratio was always based on faulty science and misguided assumptions and it still disproportionately punishes blacks who make up more than  percent of
