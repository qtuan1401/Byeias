Saturday on MSNBC’s “Melissa ” former Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner (D) accused GOP presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Gov. Chris Christie ( ) of calling President Barack Obama “boy” during Thursday’s GOP debate.  “To call the president a boy, those of us who understand   history, that’s exactly what they called him, was a boy,” Turner stated. “You don’t do that to anybody, but especially an   man who’s going to walk out of the White House in the same way he walked into the White House. The only Republican on that stage that didn’t call the president out was Governor John Kasich, my governor. ” One of the problems with Turner’s accusations is the clips shown by MSNBC at the beginning of the segment have Cruz saying, “Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child,” while Christie says in his clip, “The President wants to do things without working with his Congress. This guy’s a petulant child, that’s what he is. The American people have rejected your agenda and now you’re trying to go around it. That’s not right. It’s not constitutional and we’re going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
