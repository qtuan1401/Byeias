On Thursday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton struggled to use a MetroCard before boarding the subway in New York City while on a campaign visit to the city.  Former Rep. Michele Bachmann posted a video on her Twitter page Friday that was directed at the former New York senator to show her just how “easy” and “quick” the subway turnstiles are to use. “This is for Hillary Clinton. I know you had a tough time, Hillary, trying to figure out how to do the subway system even though you were the U. S. Senator from New York,” Bachmann said as she successfully swiped her card. “It’s just that easy just that quick. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
