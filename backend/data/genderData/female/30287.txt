MSNBC Political Correspondent Kasie Hunt stated that Democratic presidential candidates former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) are “extraordinarily frustrated” with each other and are no longer maintaining a “facade of sort of civility” on Thursday’s “Place for Politics” on MSNBC.  Hunt said, “I think you’ve seen this flare underneath the surface of this Democratic race for last couple of weeks. You saw it bubble up when Hillary Clinton was asked by that Greenpeace activist about fossil fuels, and she got angry, and you saw Sanders’ anger spill out into the open today, and last night, when he first made these remarks. I think the two of them, despite the fact that they’re maintaining in public this  —   or have at least, until the last 24 hours, this facade of sort of civility, and oh we’re having a   conversation, they’re both extraordinarily frustrated with the other, for different reasons. ” (  GOP War Room) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
