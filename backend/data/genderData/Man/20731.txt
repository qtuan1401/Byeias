Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press, former “Nightly News” anchor Tom Brokaw commented on the mass shooting in Florida that killed 50 and injured over 40 more and said that a conversation in America about guns “absolutely belongs on our political debate. ”  Brokaw said, “We don’t have any dialogue going on in America about all these mass shootings that have occurred since San Bernardino. And they have been going on around the country, three or more at a time. This absolutely belongs to a political debate and it ought to be a place where both parties can talk about it in a rational fashion. You’ve got a problem, get a gun. that’s what goes now, it’s got to come to an end. It’s a terrible commentary. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
