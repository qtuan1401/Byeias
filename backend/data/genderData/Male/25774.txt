The father of the radical Islamic terrorist who murdered 50 people at an Orlando gay bar has posted a video on Facebook claiming ignorance for his son’s motives, arguing that God will punish gays, according to CBS News. [In a video posted early Monday, CBS reports, Seddique Mir Mateen  —   the father of Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen  —   expresses sadness for the shooting during Ramadan and says that he was “not aware what motivated [his son] to go into a gay club and kill 50 people. ”  Seddique Mateen further notes that “God will punish those involved in homosexuality,” adding it is “not an issue that humans should deal with. ” According to CBS’ report, Seddique Mateen also hosts a program on a satellite Afghan TV show called the “Durand Jirga Show,” largely view by Pashtun Afghans in the U. S. and Europe. A senior Afghan intelligence source told CBS that Mateen’s show has an   and   slant. The Taliban Islamic extremist movement is comprised almost entirely of Pashtuns, and Mateen’s show takes a decidedly Pashtun nationalistic,   slant full of  . S. rhetoric and inflammatory language aimed at   and at Pakistan, the source told Logan. The elder Seddique’s Monday video is one of many in which he does not speak English and dons military garb. In his Facebook videos, the alleged gunman’s father has often appeared wearing a military uniform and declaring himself the leader of a “transitional revolutionary government” of Afghanistan. He claims to have his own intelligence agency and close ties to the U. S. Congress  —   assets he says he will use to subvert Pakistani influence and take control of Afghanistan. After watching his videos  —   none of which were recorded in English  —   CBS News’ Ahmad Mukhtar said it seemed possible that Seddique Mateen is delusional. “He thinks he runs a government in exile and will soon take the power in Kabul in a revolution,” notes Mukhtar.
