BERLIN (AP)  —   German police say they have arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive   New Year’s party. [Using the hashtag “#nichtlustig”  —   meaning “not funny”  —   Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us. ”  Tens of thousands of people are celebrating the New Year near Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate amid tight security. Large concrete blocks have been place around the security cordon to prevent a repeat of the truck attack that killed twelve people in Berlin before Christmas. The suspected attacker,    Tunisian, was shot dead in Italy days afterward.
