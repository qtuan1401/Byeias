Saturday during the GOP Debate on ABC News, presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson was asked about fellow candidate Ted Cruz’s campaign spreading false rumors about the suspension of Carson’s campaign.  Carson, citing Ronald Reagan’s “11th commandment” to not attack fellow Republicans, said he was “disappointed” in Cruz’s campaign. In response, Cruz explained his team’s mistake, saying they were just following the report made by CNN on live television. “When this transpired, I apologized to him then and I do so now. Ben, I’m sorry. Let me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night, about 6:30 p. m. CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina, rather, he was, quote, ‘Taking a break from campaigning.’ They reported that on television, CNN’s political anchors, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNN’s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television. Now, at the time, I was at the caucuses I was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like Ben was, just like everyone else was. I knew nothing about this. A couple hours later, I was told that Ben was unhappy. I called him that evening because I respect him very, very highly. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
