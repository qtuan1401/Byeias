Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign is outraged after a supporter of Bernie Sanders referred to her as a “corporate whore. ”[Health care activist Dr. Paul Song made the comment as he introduced Sanders during a rally in Washington Square Park:  Now Secretary Clinton has said that Medicare for all will never happen. Well, I agree with Secretary Clinton that Medicare for all will never happen if we have a president who never aspires for something greater than the status quo Medicare for all will never happen if we continue to elect corporate Democratic whores who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry instead of us. Song tweeted an apology last night, but the Clinton campaign demanded that Sanders address the remark. I am very sorry for using the term ”whore” to refer to some in congress who are beholden to corporations and not us. It was insensitive.  —   Paul Y. Song (@paulysong) April 14, 2016,  By Thursday morning, Clinton Communications director Jennifer Palmieri called for Sanders to disavow the remark, calling it “very distressing language to say the least. ” On MSNBC this morning, Clinton surrogate Sen. Claire McCaskill told viewers that it was “totally unacceptable” and that Sanders should have condemned the remark immediately. “There was a huge cheer that went up when Hillary Clinton was called a corporate whore,” she complained. “And that’s when the candidate has to step in and go, wait a minute, guys, remember what the real enemy is here. ” By 8:30 a. m. Sanders delivered his own statement on the comment on Twitter. “Dr. Song’s comment was inappropriate and insensitive. There’s no room for language like that in our political discourse,” he wrote.
