Wednesday at the CNN Democratic presidential debate, candidate Hillary Clinton said the 2012 Benghazi terror attack was “influenced” by an   YouTube video.  “I emailed with my daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi,” Clinton said. “Within   hours, they rescinded taking credit. They did it all on social media. And the video did play a role. We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video. This was fog of war. This was complicated. The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that. Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans and I of course sympathize with members of the families who are still very much grieving and I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time but we learned a lot and the intelligence kept improving and we learned enough to say what we think happened at Benghazi.
