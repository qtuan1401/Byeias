Washington (CNN) Jeb Bush has tapped a Republican communications operative with to run his campaign, as part of a shakeup that has left the presumptive operations chief to run early primary election strategy instead.  Danny Diaz will become campaign manager for the former Florida governor’s campaign    which is expected to be announced June 15    and David Kochel will serve as chief strategist, Bush aides confirmed to CNN Monday.  Diaz was a deputy communications director on 2008 nominee John McCain’s campaign, a communications director of the Republican Party and a senior adviser on Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign. But the top campaign post had been originally expected to go to Kochel, when he and Diaz were both hired by the Bush Super PAC this past February.

The   adjustments preview a formal campaign announcement from Bush that is now just days away. Mike Murphy, a veteran Bush strategist, has already been tapped to run the Bush super PAC. Other top staff picked by the Bush campaign include Tim Miller as communications director, Heather Larrison as finance director, Jon Downs, who will run media operations, Brenda Gianiny will direct polling and Alex Lundry will oversee data analysis.
