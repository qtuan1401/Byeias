On Wednesday night a clown in an SUV put his hands in the shape of a gun, pointed them at a woman, mouthed the words “bang,” then sped off when she pulled a real gun and pointed it toward him. [The incident occurred around 5:30 pm in Auburn, Maine.  According to the   Sun Journal, the woman was sitting on her porch when the SUV stopped in front of her house. “The vehicle’s rear window went down” and a “scary clown” was in the backseat. She observed, “He had a red Afro wig on and a red nose” and “the smile was creepy  —   the   one. ” She first responded to the incident by laughing and saying, “I’m not afraid of clowns. ” Then the clown formed his hands in the shape of a gun, pointed his fingers at her and mouthed the word “bang. ” At that point the woman responded by pulling a 9mm handgun and pointing it toward the clown. The SUV sped away. The woman said, “I picked up my 9 mm  —   I didn’t point it at him directly,” the woman said, “and said, ‘Back at ya, clown. ’” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
