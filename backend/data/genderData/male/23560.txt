Police found graffiti in Detroit that specifically threatened police and the Detroit police chief’s life Thursday. [Detroit Police Chief James Craig addressed reporters Friday afternoon in response to a graffiti message found in the area of W. State Fair Avenue and John R. Street, reading, “Kill All Police. Kill James Craig,” WWJ reported.  “Is it troubling? Absolutely. Do we take it serious? Yes we do,” Craig said. “Given the environment that we’re in today, we don’t take threats lightly. Any time you threaten a Detroit police officer  —   and now the Detroit Police Chief  —   that’s a threat on all of us. ” Craig said that despite the personal threats, he is not “deterred” in stopping the culprit of this crime. “Whatever your motives or reasons for that, we will continue to do what we do, we will continue to fight this fight.   …     We will continue to reduce violent crime in the city of Detroit, regardless of what idle threats individuals might make,” Craig said. Police are investigating the threat and looking at nearby surveillance footage. Craig said the owner of the building has already painted over the graffiti. Craig said that whoever was responsible for the graffiti is looking at felony terrorist threat charges. “The coward that did this, just know, it’s a matter of time  —   we’ll find you,” Craig said.
