 (CNN) A woman is hospitalized in critical condition after an alligator bit her hand at a fish camp in the Florida Everglades, authorities said.  The unidentified    woman was bitten Friday night near Fort Lauderdale, according to Mike Jachles, spokesman for the Broward Sheriff’s Fire Rescue. The victim, who was on a dock, dropped a can in the water and when she reached her hand in to retrieve it, the alligator struck. Crowds rushed to her rescue, pulling her back and preventing her from falling into the water.  The woman lost a lot of blood and was in shock when authorities arrived.  ”Her right hand was almost totally amputated,” Jachles said.  The alligator was about 4 to 5 feet long. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is investigating.
