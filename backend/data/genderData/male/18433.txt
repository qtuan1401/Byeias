The father of the man suspected in multiple bombings throughout New York and New Jersey this weekend says he reported his son to the FBI as a potential terrorist. Officials have confirmed that Mohammed Rahami reported his son Ahmed Khan Rahami in 2014, but law enforcement took little action following the alert.   The New York Times confirmed with U. S. federal officials that Rahami did indeed report his son as a potential terrorist. Ahmed Rahami had allegedly stabbed his brother in the leg, and spent three months in jail over the incident, though he was never charged and, thus, did not have a criminal record. Rahami’s report on his son was reportedly “passed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Newark. Officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of F. B. I. investigations, and interviewed the father, who then recanted. ” The Times quotes their sources as saying that the elder Rahami later said he had only reported his son “out of anger. ” “It is not clear if officers interviewed Ahmad Rahami” over the report, the Times notes.
