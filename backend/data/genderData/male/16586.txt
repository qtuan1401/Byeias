A video tape that is sweeping social media revealed a giant brawl that began after what one patron said was a fight over $5 chips and red or green salsa. The fight took place shortly before 3 a. m. last Saturday morning and the live video coverage now has nearly 2 million views. [While the red or green salsa may not actually be the motive for the fight, an argument can be seen in the video below, taken by Isael Rojas and posted to his Facebook page. It all began early Saturday morning at the El Paisano Restaurant and Taqueria in northwest Dallas, according to the Dallas Morning News. The video reveals some men trying to control an angry woman. Shortly after that, another woman runs into the mix and begins fighting. One woman can be seen being dragged around by her hair as punches begin to fly.  Several skirmishes broke out between different groups and soon chairs were flying in all directions. Drinks and other food items spilled to the floor creating a surface that appeared more like an   surface than a restaurant floor as people began falling after throwing punches. Soon, tables were also being thrown as patrons tried to either protect themselves or attack another person in the brawl. Officials finally arrived to attempt to restore order, but by that time, many of the people involved had fled the scene. The videographer, Isael Rojas, initially said that the fight was over the $5 chips and the choice of red or green salsa. He later told a Telemundo reporter that he was just joking and he didnâ€™t really know what caused the melee. Management of the El Paisano would not comment on camera, but told Fox4 reporters they believe the fight was more likely drunken stupidity. No arrests were made and no injuries were reported.
