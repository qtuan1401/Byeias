The White House has enlisted veteran actor Bill Murray to get the word out during the final days of open enrollment to receive health insurance next year under the Affordable Care Act. [In a video tweeted by the official White House account Sunday evening, Murray and President Obama take turns putting into a glass in the Oval Office as the president reminds viewers that open enrollment for the health care exchanges ends on December 15.  So Bill Murray walks into the Oval Office  …     #GetCovered https:  .   —   The White House (@WhiteHouse) December 12, 2016,  “Generally, I don’t let Cubs fans into the Oval Office,” Obama jokes as the    actor lines up a shot. “It’s probably not a coincidence that your popularity is at an   high,” Murray jokes back. “So I would just stick with this if I were you. I would just ride this baby. ” When Murray bends down to retrieve his ball, he winces, telling Obama his knee has been bothering him. “I don’t have anyone to look at it,” Murray tells Obama. “You don’t have health insurance?” Obama asks the actor. “Look, Bill. You don’t have to go without health insurance because these days  —   because of the Affordable Care Act  —   anybody can get health insurance and it doesn’t matter if you already have something wrong with you because insurance companies have to take you even if you have a   condition. ” After sinking another putt, Murray jokingly asks Obama where First Lady Michelle Obama keeps his money. This isn’t the first time Obama has enlisted celebrity star power to help promote the Affordable Care Act. Shortly after the launch of the legislation, the White House called on celebrity supporters to promote it with the hashtag #GetCovered, which is still in use. In 2014, Obama appeared on Funny or Die’s popular web series “Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis” to similarly promote the health exchanges.    Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
