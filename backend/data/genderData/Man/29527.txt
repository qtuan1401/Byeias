Faulting Washington, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee tells Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon: “Things never change whether it’s Republicans or Democrats because the same donor class that gives to Democrats also gives to Republicans. It’s almost like a strip club. If you throw dollars at the dancers, they’ll dance the dance you want. ”[Huckabee also said South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley missed an opportunity at the State of the Union address when she said there was a lot of anger in the country. She could have said the anger is because people are tired of Republicans acting like Democrats.  Continuing his   theme, said Huckabee, “When Paul Ryan was growing his beard back in December, I wondered if maybe he was preparing to play the role of Santa Claus, which he did when the Republicans gave Obama and Pelosi and Reid everything that they wanted in the budget deal. And all we got was a lump of coal in our stocking. ” Bannon also asked Huckabee how he could fight the Clinton machine in a general election if he were the Republicans nominee. “There are no rules. There are no boundaries. There are no limits” in fighting the Clinton machine politically,” he said. The rest of the interview can be heard below.
