Hillary Clinton stated Friday that she did not know if she could even stand up because she was so exhausted during the disastrous Democratic convention in Philly. [“By the end of those two weeks that’s exactly how I felt, it was, ‘Oh my gosh, I don’t know that I can get up, let alone what I will do if I am vertical,’” Hillary Clinton said in a campaign podcast.  “I, knock on wood, am pretty lucky because I have a lot of stamina and endurance, which is necessary in the kind of campaign I’m engaged in,” Clinton stated. “But I also   …     try to eat right, not always succeeding but try, try to get enough sleep, try to get exercise. Now I’m not going to pretend that I like it because I don’t but between yoga and walking, getting on the treadmill, some weights, I try to keep up,” Clinton added. Photographic evidence of Clinton being helped up a flight of stairs in South Carolina recently set the Internet on absolute fire, inciting alarms about the candidate’s health. Clinton is still on medication after suffering a blood cot.
