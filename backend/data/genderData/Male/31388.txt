On January 9, determined gun show attendees outside San Francisco’s Cow Palace stood in a   line that stretched across the parking lot to buy tickets to get inside. [The show was held just four days after President Barack Obama announced executive gun controls. The attendance was reportedly predicted to be 7, 000 —  “double the usual 3, 500” that attend.  According to the Contra Costa Times, “The sprawling exhibit hall was packed with vendors selling everything from ear plugs and   to kits that allow you to make your own    . ” The gun show’s owner, Bob Templeton, is a Utah resident. He explained to the Times that the huge crowd in attendance was there “for two reasons  —   the safety of their family and President Obama’s call for more gun control. ” President Obama has proven to be the gun industry’s most effective, if inadvertent, pitchman —  even in the Golden State of California, where many of the restrictions he would like to see implemented nationwide already exist.
