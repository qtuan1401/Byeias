A 911 call came in to authorities around 4:30 p. m. Friday, Los Angeles police Detective Meghan Aguilar told CNN affiliate  . When USC officers arrived, they found the victim suffering multiple stab wounds and a male suspect still on the scene, she said. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to a local police station, according to Aguilar. Information on a motive wasn’t immediately available, but police told the station they believe the attack was not random. ”This victim was targeted by the suspect so the safety of this campus is not in question,” Aguilar told KABC. The stabbing happened in the Seeley G. Mudd Building on the last day of classes before final exams. Tjan was an expert in the field of perception, vision and vision cognition who had been affiliated with the university since 2001.

L. Max Nikias wrote to the USC community. Varun Soni, the university’s dean of religious life, will lead an   gathering for reflection and prayer Monday.
