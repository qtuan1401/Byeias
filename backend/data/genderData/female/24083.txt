On Tuesday’s broadcast of “MSNBC Live,” Representative Raul Grijalva ( ) who supported Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) but is now supporting Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that if the Clinton Foundation is “an extraneous issue, that goes to the heart of whether it’s trust or transparency, then get rid of it. ”  Grijalva was asked if he believes it’s time for the Clintons to take a different course of action regarding the Clinton Foundation. He responded, “Yeah, I do, and I think that there is a lot at stake in this election. And I think if anybody knows that, it’s Secretary Clinton, and I think her positions, and the strength of  —   she’s been speaking to on issues, is powerful, and certainly has my support. But, we’ve got to get rid of extraneous issues, and if this foundation is an extraneous issue, that goes to the heart of whether it’s trust or transparency, then get rid of it. Because there is so much on the table right now for the American people and for the future of this nation that extraneous issues such as the foundation, which if that is something that needs to be cut off, then it should be cut off. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
