An   old girl who fled from a correctional facility in Australia messaged the news to ask them to use a better mugshot. [Amy Sharp, who was being held at Surry Hills Corrective Services Cell Complex in Sydney, escaped from the facility on August 19th.  The police consequently released mugshots of the woman and “urged members of the public not to approach Amy, but to contact  triple zero (000) immediately. ” However, soon after releasing the mugshot and accompanying statement, Sharp commented on the post for 7 News Sydney, asking them to use a different photo of her before thanking them for their cooperation.  The news service later confirmed that she had been arrested by police and was “being taken to Newtown Police Station where it is expected she will be charged. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
