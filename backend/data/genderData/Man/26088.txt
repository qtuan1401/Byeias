Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame wide receiver and NFL Network analyst Michael Irvin told TMZ Sports that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones could fix troubled Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, who is speculated to be released by the team who drafted him in the first round as soon as possible.  “I do believe whenever a man connects with the right person, and Jerry Jones is one of the right people, that can reach down inside the kid and pull out the king. There’s a king in every kid, even though he runs astray,” Irvin said. He then blasted the Browns for not doing more to help Manziel with his struggles. “Cleveland doesn’t have any d —   body that can help him do that. They’re trying to save their own life. Forget about trying to save his. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
