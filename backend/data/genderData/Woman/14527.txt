On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Hardball,” host Chris Matthews stated that the Republicans’ White House ceremony after the passage of the AHCA was like North Korea “where you have to have the same expression for Kim   or else you get executed. ”  Matthews said, “I was thinking, when I watched those forced smiles yesterday at the White House, this is what it’s like in Pyongyang, in North Korea, where you have to have the same expression for Kim   or else you get executed. They didn’t look truly spontaneously happy, but fixed grins and smirks all around. ” Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus responded, “Well, maybe like in North Korea, they were simply relieved to manage to be there, and not be hauled off in some way. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
