A woman has died after a masked man wielding a knife and a   shotgun stormed a retirement home for Catholic Monks in Montpellier in the South of France. [According to local news sources, armed police scrambled to the Maison de Retraite des Missions Africaines on Thursday night.  “An individual, who was masked and armed with a knife and a   shotgun came into the retirement home where 70 monks live,” a source told Agence France Presse. Police have said there is as yet no evidence to suggest the attack is   but it comes just months after Islamic State supporters murdered a priest in Rouen. The gunman is believed to have been wearing a hood, entering the home at around 9:45pm local time. “A supervisor inside the building raised the alarm very discreetly,” the Mail reports a local police source as having commented. The victim was stabbed and found gagged and bound outside the home, French police said.
