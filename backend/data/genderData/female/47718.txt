’  ’ ’   Tech investors are increasingly writing veto rights into their   term sheets to make sure a company goes public at a certain price    —   or else. ’ ’   In  a review of 136 term   sheets found that the practice is on the rise as venture capital   funding chills. ’ ’   In  only 15% of the term sheets of   highly valued companies had IPO blocking rights during the first   three quarters of 2015. From when the  in venture capital began in Q4 of 2015 into the   new year, the number rose to 24%. ’ ”   What does this mean for companies? Investors can basically veto   an initial public offering if the price isn’t to their liking.   Fintech company Affirm, for example, gave some of its investors   rights to block an IPO if it wasn’t priced at 2. 5 times as much   as its latest valuation. DoorDash investors can veto if it’s less   than three times its latest valuation. ” ”   It’s not a lost cause if a company prices too low. Investors   could negotiate for extra shares to let it go through at the last   minute. The rise of veto rights, though, means startups have yet   another hurdle to clear before going public. ” ’. ’
