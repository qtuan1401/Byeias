’  ’ ’   Walker Percy was a great, cosmopolitan southern novelist and   essayist who died in 1990. ’ ’   Born in Alabama, he lived much of his life in Covington, a town   near New Orleans. ’ ”   That’s pretty far from Kentucky and the annual Run for the Roses,   which takes place on Saturday at the magnificent Churchill Downs   racetrack. ” ’   But the signature drink of the Derby, the first leg of the Triple   Crown, is the mint julep. And Walker Percy knew mint juleps. ’ ”   A julep is actually a pretty simple variation on the basic   whiskey cocktail. We’re talking about Kentucky here, so the   whiskey of choice is Bourbon. ” ”   Typically, some sugar and mint is muddled at the bottom of a   glass, and then in goes the ice and the booze. Cool, sweetened   Bourbon, a good bit of it.

And mind you,   this is a Bourbon drinker’’s mint julep  —   there isn’’t enough sugar   in it to take the edge off the liquor. In fact, it comes from   Percy’’s short 1975 essay ”Bourbon.” ’ ”   I love that last line! Cumulative bliss! Sounds pretty good to   me.
