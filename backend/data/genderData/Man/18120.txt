Wednesday on his Fox Sports Radio show “Outkick the Coverage,” Clay Travis responded to San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick saying his national anthem protests have made “an impact on a lot of people’s lives. ”  Travis, who said he agrees with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that the protests are “dumb and disrespectful,” called the   49ers starting quarterback “absurdly delusional” to believe he made an impact with his protest. “He believes that kneeling is having a huge impact on a lot of people’s lives?” Travis stated. “All he’s doing is demonstrating how little he actually understands how the world works. I just find this guy to be totally unlikable, thoroughly unintelligent and absurdly delusional in his belief that ‘taking a knee is having an impact on a lot of people’s lives.’ I agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It’s dumb and disrespectful. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
