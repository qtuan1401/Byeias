New York (AFP)  —   Troubled singer Chris Brown has released a song shortly after his arrest for allegedly threatening a woman  —   and the lyrics may obliquely take aim at her. [Brown, who was released on $250, 000 bail, late Wednesday put out for free a dance track entitled “What Would You Do?”  Set to an infectious electronic beat, Brown addresses an unnamed person as he says that he “needs some answers  —   answers from you. ” “What do you do fighting for your life? And no one’s on your side,” he sings. “Yeah baby, I can’t stand to lose you   See, you’re in too deep   And no, nowhere to hide. ” Police headed to Brown’s palatial Los Angeles home early Tuesday after Baylee Curran, the winner of the Miss California Regional contest, said that the singer pointed a gun at her. Brown, 27, kept the officers waiting for hours as he demanded they produce a warrant and denounced police brutality in a series of   Instagram videos. Curran said that she had partied previously with Brown and that he grew angry after she admired a piece of jewelry. Brown has been as well known in recent years for violent incidents and legal   as for his music. Most notoriously, he pleaded guilty in 2009 to beating up pop star Rihanna, his then girlfriend, ahead of the Grammy Awards.
