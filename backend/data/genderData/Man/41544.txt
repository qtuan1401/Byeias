 (CNN)”The Walking Dead” has begun shooting its sixth season, but not without incident. Seth Gilliam, who joined the cast last season as the morally conflicted Rev. Gabriel Stokes, was arrested early Sunday in Peachtree City, Georgia. According to the Peachtree City police, Gilliam was speeding 107 mph in a   zone, and a marijuana cigarette was found in the car. He was taken to the Fayette County Jail and charged with DUI, drug possession and speeding. Gilliam was near Senoia, Georgia, where the hit AMC series is shot. Peachtree City is about 30 miles southwest of downtown Atlanta. A representative for Gilliam has not returned calls for comment.
