 (CNN) A California beach was invaded over the weekend by a terrifyingly cute horde of waddling corgis. Around 500 of the fluffy, stubby pooches scampered onto Huntington Beach for the annual So Cal Corgi Beach Day, immediately melting the hearts of all humans there. Fans could hardly contain their excitement, tweeting and Instagramming the corgi orgy with #SoCalCorgiBeachDay, which trended on Twitter. According to organizers, only 12 corgis attended the first Beach Day in 2012. But this time, the corgis were spread over nearly a mile of the coastline. Many came in style. The one on the left is Sneakers, a    corgi who has over 8, 000 followers on Instagram. Corgis came from all over the country for the party    some tried out a first dip in the waves.  Others couldnâ€™t resist frolicking in the sand. All of them made new friends. It was a good day.
