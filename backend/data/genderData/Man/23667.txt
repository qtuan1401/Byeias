The Orlando terrorist’s father Seddique Mateen was not an invited guest of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, according to the campaign, even though he sat directly behind the presidential candidate turning a rally in Florida. [“This individual wasn’t invited as a guest and the campaign was unaware of his attendance until after the event,” an anonymous Clinton campaign official said in a statement to reporters, noting that it was an “ ” rally open to the public.  A WPTV reporter recognized Mateen at the rally and interviewed him after the event. “It’s a Democratic party so everybody can enjoy,” he said, when asked why he decided to attend the rally. It is unclear how or why Mateen made his way onto the stage behind Clinton, although traditional staffers select diverse supporters to serve as a backdrop.
