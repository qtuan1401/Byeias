Washington (CNN) Republican presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz apologized for an   joke about Vice President Joe Biden Wednesday night. While speaking at a GOP dinner in Michigan on Wednesday, Cruz delivered an   stump speech line poking fun at Biden, mentioning his name and then saying, ”You know the nice thing? You don’t need a punchline,” according to the Detroit News. ”Honestly, it works,” Cruz said, according to the news report. ”The next party you’re at, just walk up to someone and say, ’Vice President Joe Biden’ and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing.”  While the line is often   on his campaign trail, this time it fell flat. Biden’s son, Beau, passed away from brain cancer on Saturday.
