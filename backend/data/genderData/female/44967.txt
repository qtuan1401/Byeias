’  ’ ’   Thousands of Americans will be putting chairs in the backyard and   firing up the grill for Memorial Day weekend.  ’ ’   Plumes of savory smoke will surely dot the nation  —   and   many will be heading to a warehouse store like Costco to buy   barbecue and party supplies in bulk beforehand.  ’ ’   Racks of ribs and   packs of hot dogs will be flying off   the shelves in a celebratory   frenzy. ’ ”   Yet so many shopping for dogs to grill themselves will breeze   right past perhaps the best hot dogs in the country: Costco’s. ” ”   I’m no   connoisseur, but of all I’ve tried in my life thus   far, Costco’s is .  ” ”   How is the nation’s best hot dog from such a   place as   the Costco cafeteria?   ” ”   First of all, it’s a great value. You can order a hot dog   and a drink for $1. 50  —   that’s it. And considering how large the   hot dog is, it’s definitely an outrageous deal.  ” ”   But a deal alone isn’t enough to sway most. The expectations are   understandably low for a Costco meal. But on that first bite,   it’s abundantly clear that this is no     hot   dog.  ” ’  ’ ”   The dog is unexpectedly flavorful. Gone is the bland, hollow   taste of the average hot dog; instead, a delightful smoky   taste pervades, similar to a kielbasa sausage but not as   fatty or rich. There’s a slight charred taste to it that   isn’t overpowering. It’s juicy, and there’s a satisfying snap   with every bite. ” ”   This is not the lifeless frankfurter that one microwaves for 30   seconds before chopping up and throwing in some        dinner. Nay  —   this dog has vitality. The   condiments aren’t needed to mask the   saltiness   that they normally would, but simply to compliment the already   delicious hot dog.  ” ”   Speaking of condiments: Ketchup, mustard, relish, onions,   and sauerkraut  —   if you’re into that  —   are all at your   disposal at Costco’s commissary. Such freedom is truly a   national treasure worthy of our patronage.  ” ’  ’ ”   The bun is deceptively simple  —   what’s in a bun, after all? It’s   seen as the vehicle, not the cargo. Yet the bun is the   unsung hero of this hot dog. ” ”   It’s soft and pliant, and tastes lightly sweet, which complements   the dog itself perfectly. But the real magic happens when the   condiments are dumped on the dog with wild abandon  —   precisely   because nothing happens. The bun is immune to shabby sogginess or   untimely breakage. It’s truly miraculous.  ” ”   By all means, grill your own hot dogs in the backyard  —   char them   if you must. But if you find yourself heading to Costco to stock   up on huge amounts of paper napkins, meat for the grill, etc. do   yourself a favor and grab a hot dog on the way out. You’ll be   surprised.  ” ’Thousands of Americans will be putting chairs. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
