Progressive superhero fans took to Twitter Monday to petition Marvel to change Captain America’s sexual orientation in an upcoming film. [Using the hashtag #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend, thousands of people asked the company behind the popular superhero to   him as a gay man in an upcoming installment.  Some Twitter users were quick to offer a candidate who could capture Captain America’s heart Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier, played by actor Sebastian Stan in the latest installment in the Marvel cinematic universe, Captain America: Civil War. #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend  Options are:1. Bucky barnes2. James buchanan barnes3. The winter soldier 4. Bucky5.

Twitter users in that campaign used the hashtag #GiveElsaAGirlfriend. While the majority of tweeters used the Captain America hashtag earnestly, a vocal contingent of critics questioned why the character’s sexual orientation needed to be explored at all. Why do people feel a need to put sexuality with everything making someone ”gay” isn’t going to include you :3#GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend,  —   Amora Bunny (@AmoraBunny) May 24, 2016,  #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend is the most ridiculous hashtag I have ever seen,  —   Rick Parker (@RicardoCantill0) May 24, 2016,  Instead of #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend how about we introduce an actual gay character. Wiccan, Hulkling, Moondragon,   anyone?  —   The Adapter (@TAdapter) May 24, 2016,  #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend has to be one of THE DUMBEST things ever. If he didn’t start out gay then don’t make him gay.  —   tyrus (@tysattley) May 24, 2016,  Of course, there is some recent precedent for gay Disney characters last month, an episode of the   television series Once Upon a Time featured a lesbian “true love’s kiss” between Ruby and the Wizard of Oz‘s Dorothy.
