Police said they arrested seven University of Albany students for alleged hazing, after investigating a sorority for a noise complaint. [Police arrived at the   sorority and found four women being forced to eat mud and garbage, CBS New York reported.  Sorority members are also accused of pouring liquids with an extremely unpleasant smell onto the women. A student, who did not want to be identified, dropped out of the pledging process early on because of what she described as abuse. “They would say like ‘you’re worthless,’ or ‘you’re a stupid (expletive).’ Some of us got stepped on and they’re all wearing heels,” she said. Seven women, ages 19 to 21, were arrested. “Hazing is not only dangerous, it’s against the law,” Albany Police Officer Steve Smith said. A university spokesman denounced the hazing and said the sorority, Alpha Omicron Pi, is not recognized by the university. This is not the only time hazing rituals have gone amok. In October 2015, five members of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity at the University of Mississippi were arrested for beating a member of another fraternity. Some of the men who beat him allegedly wore pledge gear. At Penn State University, Kappa Delta Rho was banned until 2018 for sexual harassment and hazing rituals that included boxing matches and persistently harassing two women.
