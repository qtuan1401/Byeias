Rudy Giuliani: This is the most     enforcement convention I’ve ever seen in my whole life. https:  .  Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” in an appearance from the site of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani called the convention “the most  ” and “the most   enforcement” he had ever seen.  However, he also said that according to “  police officers” in Philadelphia, uniformed law enforcement was not allowed on the floor of the convention. “This is the most     enforcement convention I’ve ever seen in my whole life. There was not a uniformed police officer allowed on the convention floor. I was told that by four   police officers, two of whom I’ve known for a very long time. And then I walked the floor for very long time and I couldn’t find a single officer. Go look at your footage.  You find me a uniform. Hillary Clinton didn’t want uniformed police officers on the convention floor. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
