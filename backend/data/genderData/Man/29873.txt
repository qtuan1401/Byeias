A man carrying a gas can, matches, and a book by the son of a terror group founder was arrested for allegedly making terroristic threats near the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree in New York. [Police caught Yuriy Alterman, 38, acting erratically near the Rockefeller Center tree on Tuesday afternoon, the Daily Mail reported.  When officers approached him, he became combative and screamed expletives at the officers after he threw a bottle into the street, police say. Police state the red can he was carrying contained a liquid that smelled of gasoline and matches. Alterman, of the Bronx, also carried a book called Son of Hamas, which is about the son of one of the founders of the deadly terrorist group Hamas, police say. Authorities found Alterman near a building at Sixth Avenue and 48th Street and followed him to 49th Street and Rockefeller Plaza before arresting him, the New York Post reported. According to police, he did not get close to the Christmas tree, as they arrested him before he got a chance to do so. Alterman told officers he had no intention of setting anything on fire. Police charged him with making terroristic threats, obstruction of government administration, and disorderly conduct. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday night. Alterman has been arrested twice this year on criminal mischief and criminal trespass charges.
