’  ’ ”   AOL founder and current venture capitalist Steve Case has words   for Silicon Valley: you won’t be the only game in town for   much longer. ” ’   ”Last year 75% of VC went into 3 states, California, New York,   and Massachusetts, and that’’s not going to be the case 10 years   from now,” Case told Business Insider in an interview at Vanity   Fair’’s New Establishment Summit, where he is speaking. ’ ”   The reason: it’s no longer enough for a young tech company to   specialize in software alone. To thrive,   tech startups need to partner with a wide range of   companies with specific expertise in the areas they want to   conquer, he believes. ” ’   ”This next wave of entrepreneurship, what I call the third wave,   is going to require more partnerships,” Case said. ”The      wave is basically about the software   and virally spreading it. But if you’’re trying to impact health   care, education, food, energy, transportation, smart cities,   driverless cars, they’’re all going to require partnerships.” ’ ’   Those partnerships are more likely to happen in cities with   companies that already compete in these industries. As cities to   watch, Case pointed out: ’ ’’ ’   He also pointed to the example of   virtual reality   startup Magic Leap, which has raised more than $1 billion in   venture capital, as an example of how big tech companies no   longer need to be started in traditional tech hubs like Silicon   Valley. ’ ’   ”The conventional wisdom was you could never build an     company in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, you had   to do it in Silicon Valley, or maybe you could do it in Boston.   They’’ve proven that wrong,” he said. ”Talent is ready to   move, capital is ready to flow, we just need more of these   tentpole breakout stories that will help accelerate.” ’
