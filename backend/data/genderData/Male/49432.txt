’  ’ ’   Fidel Castro, the former Cuban leader who  once   requested that the leader of the Soviet Union consider   launching a nuclear strike against the US in the event the   country attacked Cuba. ’ ’   During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Castro  detailing his   concerns that an attack on Cuba was ”imminent.” ’ ’   He suggested two possible variants  —   the first being an air   attack meant to destroy specific targets, and the second a ”full   invasion,” though he acknowledged that was less likely. ’ ’   ”This would require a large force and is the most repugnant form   of aggression, which might restrain them,” he wrote. ’ ’   Castro went on to explain that should the US attempt to   invade and occupy Cuba, the country and the policies that   would ensue would pose such a threat that the Soviet Union could   not risk the possibility of a preemptive nuclear strike by the   US. ’ ’’ ’   He continued:  ’ ”   The crisis was ultimately averted after weeks of negotiations   between the Soviet Union and the US, which resulted in the   removal of the Soviets’ missiles from Cuba. ” ’   In a 2010  Castro   appeared to concede that such an attack on the US would have been   a mistake. ’ ’   When asked by Goldberg whether his recommendation to Khrushchev   still seemed logical to him, Castro responded, ”After I’’ve seen   what I’’ve seen, and knowing what I know now, it wasn’’t worth it   all.” ’
