During a statement on Tuesday, former Vice President Al Gore argued that the Electoral College should be abolished in favor of a popular vote system.  Gore said he supported keeping the Electoral College even after the 2000 election, because it tied the states together, but now he has changed his mind and thinks the Electoral College should be eliminated. He added that moving to a popular vote system wouldn’t be completely perfect, but that the balance of the “balancing act” has shifted in favor the popular vote. Gore further argued that switching to the popular vote would “stimulate public participation in the democratic process like nothing else we could possibly do. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
