Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held a brief   press conference to address the news that the FBI was revisiting the investigation into her email server after they received new information in the case. [Clinton was asked if she was aware of reports that the new information was found on devices owned by her close staffer Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner.  “You know, we’ve heard these rumors, we don’t know what to believe, and I’m sure there will even be more rumors,” she said. “That’s why it is incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what they are talking about  …     because right now your guess is as good as mine, and I don’t think that’s good enough. ” Clinton said that she didn’t know about Comey’s decision, asserting that her campaign learned about it in news reports. In a short statement, Clinton referred to Comey’s letter, adding that she was “confident” that there would be no new information to change the conclusion of the investigation in July. “I’m confident, whatever they are, will not change the conclusion reached in July,” she said, referring to the new information. Clinton signaled that the news did not matter, as voters already knew about her emails, and she urged them to vote in the upcoming election. “You know, I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails,” she said, urging “everybody to get out and vote early in all the states that have early voting. ” The Democratic presidential nominee took only three questions after her statement an aide abruptly ended the press conference. According to a reporter present, Clinton only laughed when she was asked if the news would sink her campaign. Clinton is returning to her home in New York this evening.
