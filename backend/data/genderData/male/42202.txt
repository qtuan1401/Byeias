Carroll, Iowa (CNN) Even when you’re the defending champion of the Iowa caucuses, there’s no guarantee you’ll find big crowds at every stop. When Rick Santorum stopped by Sam’s Soda and Sandwiches in Carroll, Iowa, on Monday afternoon, he was met with three of his own staffers, two Democratic campaign trackers, a waitress, two diners and one CNN reporter.  Though it may not have been the reception he hoped for, the former Pennsylvania senator took it in stride, spending about an hour drinking a chocolate milkshake and chatting with the two diners.

Afterwards, she said she was impressed by Santorum, but it was too early to decide who she would caucus for.  But Santorum’s efforts were rewarded on another front. The former senator spoke with a young man who had supported his 2012 candidacy, but this time came to Sam’s to take on a more active campaign role. Santorum declared him his new county chair.  ”It’s a lot of miles and it’s a lot of    small group conversations to get people interested in the vision that you have, and buy into that vision . .. and be willing to make a difference,” Santorum said.  And so it goes for the most recent Republican Iowa caucus victor.
