MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas  —   Mexican marines managed to rescue a kidnapping victim who had been held by cartel gunmen since the weekend. Despite much governmental rhetoric, the Gulf Cartel continues to terrorize the citizens of this border city with   ransom kidnappings for profit. [Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas and Coahuila to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “J. A. Espinoza” from Matamoros.   As Breitbart Texas previously reported, since last year the Gulf Cartel has been carrying out a series of ransom kidnappings targeting average civilians not tied to organized crime. In many of the cases, cartel gunmen have killed their victims even after the ransom money has been delivered. Despite the onslaught of kidnappings and the increasing number of victims, the crime is largely ignored by news outlets in a city that remains under the control of organized crime. According to information released by the Tamaulipas government, a squad of troops with the Mexican Navy had been patrolling the city when they came across a suspicious white Chevrolet Silverado with two gunmen inside. According to authorities, when the gunmen spotted the military convoy they sped off only to pull over a few blocks down. The gunmen ran away but left behind the SUV. When authorities searched the SUV they found a    man who had been bound, gagged and blindfolded. The military officers released the man who stated that he had been kidnapped at gun point on Saturday. Inside the vehicle, authorities also discovered a bag filled with ammunition.
