Refugees and migrants have been held at the hillside detention centre under terms of a March 20 deal between the European Union and Turkey to stem the migrant flow into Europe. It stipulates that migrants who do not qualify for political asylum must be returned to Turkey. “Riot police are conducting an operation in and out of the camp at the moment,” the police spokesman said. #Greece: More images of ongoing protest over poor conditions, by refugees, at #Moria detention camp #Lesbos pic. twitter.   —   ѕyndιcalιѕт (@syndicalisms) April 26, 2016,  Pope Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the   leader of the world’s Eastern Orthodox Christians, met migrants begging for help as they toured the Moria camp on April 16.
