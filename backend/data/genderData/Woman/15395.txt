Senator Mike Lee ( ) released a statement opposing House Speaker Paul Ryan’s American Health Care Act, or what is now being referred to by most conservatives and Republicans   as “ . ”[Lee said in a statement:  This is not the Obamacare repeal bill we’ve been waiting for. It is a missed opportunity and a step in the wrong direction. We promised the American people we would drain the swamp and end business as usual in Washington. This bill does not do that. We don’t know how many people would use this new tax credit, we don’t know how much it will cost, and we don’t know if this bill will make health care more affordable for Americans. This is exactly the type of   dealing and rushed process that we criticized Democrats for, and it is not what we promised the American people. Let’s fulfill our Obamacare repeal promise immediately and then take our time and do reform right. Let’s pass the 2015 repeal bill that Republicans in both houses of Congress voted for and sent to the White House just 15 months ago.

Roy Blunt ( ) a member of Senate GOP leadership, has already said he fears the bill may not have enough Republican support to pass Congress.
