 (CNN) Ryan Lochte is in the news again, for all the wrong reasons. The Olympic swimmer may have hoped to repair his reputation after all that negative publicity during the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games by performing on ”Dancing with the Stars.” But his dancing skills weren’t what attracted the most attention during his debut performance    it was the two protesters who crashed Monday night’s show on ABC. The incident happened   during the live broadcast, and social media immediately erupted. Fans and critics couldn’t get enough of the incident, making jokes and taking sides. Did he get ”fake robbed” again? many asked. Another poked fun at his outfit. While some are not ready to forgive and forget, others think Lochte deserved a second chance and offered words of encouragement. Whether Lochte will sink or swim after the first round of voting remains to be seen, but ”Dancing with the Stars” host Tom Bergeron is giving the security team who tackled the protesters high marks. On Tuesday, Bergeron tweeted ”Kudos again to our   security team. Their ”quickstep” gets a 10!”
