’  ’ ”   When New York City’s Elmhurst Dairy opened in 1925, founders Max   and Arthur Schwartz   milk from 200 cows. They then   delivered the bottles, which sat in containers of ice, in a truck   throughout the city. ” ’   Over the next few decades, Elmhurst became one of the biggest   dairy companies in NYC. ’ ”   But these days, making milk isn’t as profitable as it   used to be. Business declined in recent years to the point   that Elmhurst wasn’t making enough money to keep operating.   CEO Henry Schwartz (son of Max) shut down the plant in the   outer borough of Queens in late 2016.  ” ”   The company isn’t dead, however  —   it’s now producing     milks (made from almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, and cashews) and     as . ” ’   ”After 92 years in business, it was time to embrace a new model   and look toward the future,” Schwartz, age 82, tells Business   Insider.  ’ ’   The company has only launched in a few New   grocers so   far, but according to Mike Brown, senior vice   president ’ ’   Before it closed, Elmhurst  ’ ’   The closure reflects larger hardships in the US dairy industry,   which has suffered in recent years due to changing consumer   preferences. ’ ’        ’ ”   Elmhurst’s new    foot facility will be in   Elma, a Central New York town that’s 360 miles north   of Manhattan. ” ’  ’ ’   At the plant, the company has developed its own process   of making the nutmilks, which it calls ”milking.” Cold milling   machines extract all of the protein, fat, and micronutrients   from the nuts, which means Elmhurst doesn’’t need to fortify   the milks with additional vitamins. Its milks also are   free of the stabilizers, whiteners, and gums that some     milks contain.  ’ ’   ”It’’s about transforming with the times,” Schwartz says. ”As   awareness and demand for vegan products continues to grow, we’re   seeing   options become mainstream.” ’ ’   Though the company only sells its milk in Publix stores in New   York for now, it plans to distribute to other grocers   in Miami, Tampa, and Atlanta this year. It will also ship   online orders nationally in coming weeks. Quarts of almond   and walnut milk cost $4. 99, while hazelnut and cashew milk cost   $5. 99  —   about twice the price as most nutmilks (though   some of these are fortified with preservatives or   vitamins).  ’ ’   Now called Elmhurst Nutmilk,  features a suited man that   clinks a wine glass full of milk with a spoon. ’ ’   ”Introducing the world’’s finest nutmilk,” it reads. ’ ”When New York City’s Elmhurst Dairy opened in. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’
