Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign implied that F. B. I. Director James Comey was meddling in the presidential election, after he sent a letter to Congress informing them of new information in Clinton’s investigation into her private email server,  “It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,” Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta said, in a strongly worded statement to reporters. Podesta argued that Comey did not use the word “reopening” when discussing the new information in the investigation. He reminded reporters that Comey “completed” the case in July, finding Clinton innocent. Podesta also called into doubt the new information that was discovered, calling for Comey to release it immediately. “[W]e have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant,” Podesta said. Podesta suggested that Comey was falling prey to Republicans who repeatedly questioned his investigation, and demanded he release further details. “The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining,” he said. “We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July. ”
