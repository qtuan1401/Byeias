Texas Black Lives Matter protesters called for the “lynching” and “killing” of white people and white cops in August 2015, less than one year before the tragic sniper attack on cops in Dallas, Texas. The Dallas Police Department has reported that a motive of the Dallas   was to kill white police officers. [The calls for killing white cops were first reported by Breitbart Texas’ Lana Shadwick. She transcribed a recording of the calls for assassination (recording embedded below). She wrote:  An unidentified black man said “when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that’s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin’ one of us out, that’s how we should roll up. ”  He said, “Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. Let’s turn the tables. ” They conspired that if “cops started losing people,” then “there will be a state of emergency. ” He speculated that one of two things would happen, “a   [R’s? ????] war,” or “ni**ers, they are going to start backin’ up. ” “We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose?” Sunshine could be heard saying, “Yep, that’s true. That’s so f**king true. ” He said, “We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side. He said, “Everybody ain’t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like I say, everybody has a different position of war. ” He continued, “Because they don’t give a f**k anyway. ” He said again, “We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. ” He said, that way “we can start lookin’ like we ain’t havin’ that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. ” “They are out their killing black people, black lives don’t matter, that’s what those mother f**kers   …     so we got to make it matter to them. ” “Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. ” We “just need one example,” and “then people will start watchin’. ” This will turn the tables on s**t, he said. He said this will start “a   effect. ” He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just “” that will start the “  effect. ” He continued, “Black people are good at starting trends. ” He said that was how “to get the  . ” Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill “cops that are killing us. The first black male said, “That will be the best method right there. ” Follow Brandon Darby on Twitter and like him on Facebook.
