’  ’ ’   A   hedge fund founded by a Steve Cohen acolyte sent a   letter to investors explaining all the reasons for its   underperformance. ’ ’   In a January investor letter, Folger Hill’’s Sol Kumin   set out why his firm’’s flagship fund dropped 17. 5% last   year. Among the cited reasons: a difficult environment for stock   pickers, hedge fund ”crowding” and the US election. ’ ’   ”I am truly sorry that we have not delivered better results thus   far to our investors who put their faith in me,”Kumin wrote in   the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Business Insider.   ”I  ’ ’  ’ ”   The firm’s flagship fund, Folger Hill Partners LP,  fell   17. 5% last year net of fees, compared to a 12% rise in the   S&P 500, according to the letter. In the fourth quarter   alone, the fund fell 10% compared to a 3. 8% gain for the S&P   500.  ” ’   ”[T]he Fund’s net short positioning (1. 7%) served as a material   headwind, as U. S. equity markets generally moved higher   throughout the year,” Kumin wrote in the investor letter. ”In   addition, our short book performance was particularly poor   following the U. S. election results in November.” ’ ’   The firm also chose the wrong sectors to invest in, Kumin wrote,   focusing on ”out of favor” sectors like healthcare, consumer   staples, and technology, media, and telecoms rather than sectors   ”with greater overall momentum” such as energy, financials and   industrials. ’ ’  ’ ’   Still, the firm expects a turnaround this year. ” ’ ’  ’ ’ The firm lost about a third of its assets last year,   . The firm managed about $1 billion as of     according to the Hedge Fund Intelligence Billion Dollar   Club, and assets fell to about $600 million just three months   later, according to Reuters. Its current assets under management   were not clear.  ’ ’   Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Folger Hill, declined to   comment. ’ ’A   hedge fund founded by a Steve. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
