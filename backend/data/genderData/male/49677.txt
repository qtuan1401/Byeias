’  ’ ’   A federal jury has convicted Dylann Roof in the racially   motivated slayings of nine black church members in South   Carolina. ’ ’ They convicted the    white man of    obstruction of religion and weapons charges. ’ ’   The same jury will reconvene next month to decide whether Roof   should get the death penalty or be sentenced to life in prison. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’   Roof just stared ahead as the verdict was   read, much as he has throughout the trial. ’ ’    ’ ’   He confessed to   officials shortly after he was   arrested that he ultimately decided he ”had to go through with   his mission.” ’ ’  ’ ”   Jurors heard from witnesses who testified Roof made multiple   trips to Charleston in the months before the June 2015 attack at   Emanuel AME Church. They also heard from two survivors. Roof’s   attorneys called no witnesses. ” ’   Prosecutors said in their closing arguments Roof was filled with   hate and has already confessed to the FBI to his role in the   shootings. Defense attorneys portrayed Roof as a suicidal loner   who never fully grasped the severity of what he has done.  ’
