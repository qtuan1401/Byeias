In a clip that was aired on Friday’s “CNN Newsroom,” former President Bill Clinton said that “even with” moderator Matt Lauer, Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “did just fine” during Wednesday’s    Forum.  Clinton was asked if he was, “confident in the moderators after the other night?” He responded, “Well even with that, she did just fine. And, you know, the only thing that bothered me was that I thought there should have been more discussion about that Mexico trip, because he said his trip was a success because the finance minister got fired. ” (  Washington Free Beacon) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
