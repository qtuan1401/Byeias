Despite all the White House hype promising that last night’s State of the Union would be different, early ratings show that America just isn’t all that into their failed president, even though this was his farewell State of the Union. If these numbers hold, last night will be the lowest State of the Union audeince ever for Obama. The previous low was last year.  With an average audience of 18. 1 million watching the 9  —   10 PM coverage on ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, Obama’s speech was down 8% from last year’s January 20 talk to Congress. Heading into the twilight of his term in office that continues the POTUS downward viewership trend. Obama’s 2015 SOTU was down 7% from his 2014 speech in the early Big 4 audience averages  —   which was down from the year before. In the final viewership numbers, the 2015 speech ended up being a SOTU low for the President  —   which we could see as the case this year. Final ratings will be released later today.
