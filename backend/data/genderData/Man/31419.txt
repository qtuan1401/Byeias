The lawyer for a Somali immigrant living in Minnesota who was arrested for ties to terrorism has filed a motion to have his client released on bond. [Abdirizak Mohamed Warsame, 20, of Eagan, Minnesota, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.  But now, Warsame’s attorney is asking for his client to be allowed bond out of prison. The attorney filed papers which ask the court to release Warsame, on an unsecured bond, to his mother in Eagan. The attorney claims that there is no need to worry if he will continue his terror activities, as the terror suspect will be monitored day and night by relatives. Authorities charge that Warsame was engaged in aiding other local men to travel to Syria to join ISIS. Nine of those Warsame is connected with have already been charged. Federal investigators said that after being appointed as a community leader, or “emir,” Warsame used his position to urge locals to become terrorists. “As the new emir, Warsame immediately encouraged those with passports and money to travel to Syria by the end of the upcoming summer,” a government affidavit alleged earlier this month. Authorities charge that Warsame gave a man $200 for an expedited passport application and applied for a U. S. passport of his own on an expedited basis but was denied. Later, in August of 2014, the “emir” was approved for a passport. Officials say that Warsame then made plans to fly from Minneapolis to Istanbul, Turkey, where they say he intended to proceed on to Syria to join the jihad.
