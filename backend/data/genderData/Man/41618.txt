 (CNN) When will the world learn that you cannot beat Beyoncé? The superstar wowed the crowd at Monday night’s Met Gala in New York City with her   hairstyle and   custom Givenchy Haute Couture by Riccardo Tisci gown. She was just one of the many sights to behold at the event, which marks fashion’s biggest night. Beyoncé even gave her fans a sneak peek on her Instagram account prior to the paparazzi shots (and hopefully silenced the seemingly endless speculation that she is pregnant again, which seems to pop up at least every three to six months).  But when you come to be seen, social media is going to take the opportunity to go hard. So while Johnny Weir was positively living for ”Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker’s Philip Treacy custom headdress, others were not. And let us not even get started on the memes that singer Rihanna wrought. She wore a yellow, embroidered   cape by Guo Pei. She told Vanity Fair it was ”Chinese couture” and was ”handmade by one Chinese woman and it took her two years to make. I found it online.” Oh Internet, sometimes we just can’t with you.
