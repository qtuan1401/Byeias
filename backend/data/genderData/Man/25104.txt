  World Series Champion and New York Yankees legend Derek Jeter calls owning a Major League Baseball team “ultimate goal. ”[“I think baseball is taking somewhat of a back seat to some of the other sports,” Jeter lamented on Wednesday. “Some of the other sports are the sexy sports. ”   Jeter told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that MLB isn’t as sexy as football and basketball and he wants to help the game of baseball grow.  “I think kids, nowadays they look at players playing in college and the next year they’re in the NFL or the NBA,” he remarked. “Baseball, you sort of get lost, because you have to play in the minor leagues for a little bit. Kids in this generation are into instant gratification. ” Jeter insists that the rigors of professional baseball mirror life much more than other sports. “It’s every day. It’s 162 games, plus 30 games in spring training, plus the postseason. There’s a lot of work that goes into it. ” One of the most popular players to ever don the Yankee pinstripes, Jeter passed Lou Gehrig in 2009 with his 2, 722nd hit  —   the most in franchise history.  Jeter ended his MLB career sixth   in hits with 3, 465. Known for his excellence in   situations, the    former shortstop maintains that “baseball is the greatest sport in the world. ”
