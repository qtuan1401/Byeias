KABUL, Afghanistan  —   A suicide bomber managed to sneak onto the main American military base in Afghanistan on Saturday and kill four Americans, according to American and Afghan officials. The attacker entered on foot hidden among a group of workers reporting for duty at Bagram Air Base early in the morning, said Abdul Wahid Sediqi, spokesman for the governor of Parwan Province, where the military base and airfield are. Once inside the base, the attacker detonated explosives, Mr. Sediqi said. The blast killed two American service members and two American contractors working on the base, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said in a statement on Saturday morning. The explosion also wounded 16 American service members and a Polish soldier serving with the NATO coalition forces, the statement said. A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the attack on the militants’ behalf and said it had killed a large number of American soldiers. The Taliban often give inflated casualty figures after an attack. Mr. Sediqi said that the suicide attacker “was able to pass from the first check post at the gate of the base and enter the base. ” Bagram is heavily guarded, with several layers of security and a series of gates and check posts controlling entry. Attacks inside the base are rare, although there have been a number of episodes near its outer gates, and rockets have been fired into it. The bulk of the roughly 10, 000 American soldiers still in Afghanistan are believed to be based at Bagram.
