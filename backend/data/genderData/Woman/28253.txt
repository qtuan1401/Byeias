From the Washington Post:[A charity affiliated with the Clinton Foundation failed to reveal the identities of its 1, 100 donors, creating a broad exception to the foundation’s promise to disclose funding sources as part of an ethics agreement with the Obama administration.  The number of undisclosed contributors to the charity, the   Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, signals a larger zone of secrecy around foundation donors than was previously known. Details of the organization’s fundraising were disclosed this week by a spokeswoman for the Canadian group’s founder, mining magnate Frank Giustra. The Canadian group has received attention in recent days as a potential avenue for anonymous Clinton Foundation donations from foreign business executives, including some who had interests before the U. S. government while Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary of state. The partnership, named in part for Bill Clinton, sends much of its money to the New   Clinton Foundation. Two of the partnership’s known donors  —   Giustra and another mining executive, Ian Telfer  —   are featured in the     book “Clinton Cash” for their roles in a series of deals that resulted in Russia controlling many uranium deposits around the world and in the United States.
