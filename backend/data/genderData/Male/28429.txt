The Chicago White Sox now boast a trifecta of triple plays this season. [In the top of the third, Atlanta Braves 1B Freddie Freeman bounced a hard hit ball that ricocheted into shortstop Tim Anderson’s glove. Anderson applied the tag to Chase d’Arnaud as he retreated to second, stepped on the base to force out the runner from first, and then gunned a throw to first to beat Freeman.  The team’s third triple play of the season —  and before the   break! —  comes as the first such triple play of triple plays since 1979 when the Boston Red Sox and Oakland A’s both accomplished the fielding feat. The White Sox recorded three outs on one play against each Texas team earlier this season. They also caught Kansas City in a triple play during spring training but, alas, the record books don’t remember that. Though the top of the third infield heroics preserved a   White Sox lead, the Atlanta Braves answered Chicago’s gloves with their bats. They won the otherwise offensive affair  . No, this isn’t a replay. The @WhiteSox turn their THIRD triple play of 2016. Mercy: https:  . :  .   —   MLB (@MLB) July 9, 2016,
