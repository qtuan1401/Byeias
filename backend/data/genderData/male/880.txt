HOUSTON  —   Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was named the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player on Saturday, 24 hours before he was to try to cap his superb season with Super Bowl glory. Ryan, 31, got his first M. V. P. Award by collecting 25 of the votes while his opposite number in Sunday’s Super Bowl, the New England Patriots’ Tom Brady, finished with 10. Brady has won the award twice, for the 2007 and 2010 seasons. Ryan’s award came after a dazzling season for Atlanta’s offense in which he finished with 4, 944 passing yards, 38 touchdowns and only seven interceptions. Super Bowl LI on Sunday will be his first appearance in the title game. Brady, who is chasing his fifth Super Bowl victory, finished the season with 3, 554 passing yards, 28 touchdowns and two interceptions but played in four fewer games than Ryan because of his Deflategate suspension. Unsurprisingly, Ryan also picked up the Offensive Player of the Year Award. Ryan had the best season of his career after spending last summer working intensively on his throwing motion at a Los Angeles training camp. He averaged slightly over nine yards per pass, the highest rate ever for a quarterback with more than 400 completions in a season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award went to the Oakland Raiders’ Khalil Mack, whose season included 11 sacks, five forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and an interception returned for a touchdown as the Raiders reached the playoffs. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was a surprise pick, ahead of his teammate Ezekiel Elliott, for offensive rookie of the year. Prescott, who played the entire season for Dallas after Tony Romo injured his back in the preseason, drew 28 of 50 votes, beating out Elliott, who finished as the   with 21 votes. The Cowboys, who were beaten in their opening playoff game by the Green Bay Packers after finishing the regular season at   also saw their coach, Jason Garrett, pick up coach of the year honors.
