.@SheriffClarke: Middle America does not share Hillary Clinton’s sentiment in having sympathy for criminalshttps:  .  During Monday’s “Fox  Friends” on the Fox News Channel, Milwaukee Co. WI Sheriff David Clarke called Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “a straight up cop hater” who is “all in with the criminal element. ”  Clarke said, “She has made it clear from the convention that she is all in with the criminal element, she doesn’t care about victims of crime, she’s a straight up cop hater and so she is, like I said, rolling the dice on not having support of law enforcement. The problem for her is that middle America, mainstream America does not share her sentiment in having sympathy for criminals. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
