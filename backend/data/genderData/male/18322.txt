Three Pakistani men were apprehended after crossing into the U. S. from Mexico in the Tucson Sector. A combination of sources  —   including official confirmation from Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  —   revealed the men were in fact apprehended and are currently in U. S. federal custody. [Breitbart Texas sources first released the information and CBP confirmed via email. CPB responded:  U. S. Border Patrol agents in Nogales, AZ, apprehended three Pakistani nationals on Nov. 11. As a standard procedure, agents processed the individuals and checked their identities against numerous law enforcement and national security related databases. Record checks revealed no derogatory information about the individuals. The individuals are currently in Federal custody while they await the outcome of their immigration cases. Additional information on the individuals was obtained by federal agents working under the umbrella of CBP, but it is important to note that the additional details were not confirmed by CBP. “One of them had a shit load of hits from a bunch of places he’s been. He had entered and exited numerous countries that were not in his route to the U. S. This raises red flags because people leaving a foreign country to come here usually take the quickest route, but one of them did not,” said one of the sources. The source continued, “One of the men had his hair died blonde to disguise his appearance and all of the men spoke perfect English. ” Breitbart Texas previously broke the news that five men from Pakistan and one from Afghanistan were caught within 17 miles of the U. S.  border in the same vicinity as the current apprehensions of Pakistani men. In that case, the FBI later confirmed to other news outlets that the details from Breitbart Texas sources were correct.
