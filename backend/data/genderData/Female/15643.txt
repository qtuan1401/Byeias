Actress Lindsay Lohan has demanded a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and nearly a million dollars to appear on the popular Russian talk show Let Them Talk. [The Mean Girls actress’ lawyers sent a contract to the talk show’s network demanding a   fee of $860, 000, “full and effective security” and a “fully paid suite at the Ritz Carlton” hotel, according to a report from The Hollywood Reporter.  In response to Lohan’s demands, Let Them Talk host Andrei Malakhov said he hopes Lohan reconsiders and comes up with more reasonable ones. “I don’t know what she wanted to discuss with [Putin] probably Amur tigers or issues of people suffering from drug abuse,” Malakhov reportedly said. Malakhov speculates that Lohan’s demand to meet with Putin was a condition to appear on the show, although it did not appear in the written contract. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson.
