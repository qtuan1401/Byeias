Emails traded between staffers at the Democratic National Committee confirmed the April 26 Breitbart News article that pointed out that Democratic voter turnout in the primaries was way off compared to the 2008 primaries. [“Do we have any helpful turnout numbers yet? Fox Business cited this Breitbart article that posted yesterday,” asked Mark Paustenbach, the DNC’s deputy communications director in an email.  The Breitbart article pointed out:”Election data compiled by Breitbart News on the Democratic Party’s primaries and caucuses in 2016 and 2008 show that turnout in is down significantly, nearly 20 percent, from the last contested election. The data also show that the about 4. 5 million fewer people have voted in the Democratic presidential contest this year versus 2008. ” Paustenbach wanted some ammunition to push back, in addition to the spin by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D. .) who is the chairwoman of the DNC, that it was merely a function of fewer Democrats running for the White House. “Chair emphasizing that the GOP this cycle had so many presidential candidates compared to the few Dems. ” Sadly for Paustenbach, his DNC colleague confirmed the reportage by Matthew Boyle and Andy Badolato. Jeremy Brinster, a DNC researcher, replied back: “Comparing vote totals, turnout was down everywhere compared to 2008 Dem primaries. Only slightly down in some states. Way down in PA, way down in RI. ”
