A new report indicates that San Francisco has the lowest percentage of children of any major city in America. [The report by the New York Times indicates that only 13 percent of San Francisco’s population is under 18 years old.  “Sometimes I’ll be walking through the city and I’ll see a child and think, ‘Hey, wait a second. What are you doing here? ’” Courtney Nam, who works downtown at a tech   told the New York Times. “You don’t really see that many kids. ” The combination of   and distance of public schools has resulted in what can be regarded as a mass exodus of families with   kids to cities that are more affordable. The Times notes that the San Francisco has invested millions in upgrading parks, according to Phil Ginsburg, the general manager of the city’s Recreation and Parks Department. San Francisco Chronicle writer and San Francisco resident Amy Graff  —   who is also a mother to three kids  —   relates her own experience in the city: I was elated when one of my dearest friends finally had a baby, but crestfallen when she decided to move to Lafayette before her son started preschool. I’d assumed her son would grow up with my kids. Same thing happened with another best friend who fled for Mill Valley. My heart eventually numbed to the the mass exodus and I now approach new friendships in the way an army brat might at her third high school. I’m eager to meet new people but hesitant to get too close to protect myself from future partings.
