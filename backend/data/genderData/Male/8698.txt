During the Australian Open last month, ESPN3 fired Mike Adler from his job calling tennis matches over a comment he made when Venus Williams faced off against Stefanie Voegele. [Adler used the term “guerilla” when referencing a move used by Venus Williams, likening the play to a military maneuver or tactic. However, on social media people reacted angrily, believing Adler had meant to liken Williams to the animal “gorilla. ”  Specifically, Adler said, “You see Venus move in and put the guerrilla effect on   …     charging. ” According to TMZ, Adler says the social media freak out was misguided, “Adler says Twitter freaked out and misunderstood what he was trying to say  —   wrongly interpreting the comment as racist. Instead, Adler says the term is NOT racist, but rather a “frequently used” word in tennis to describe an aggressive style of play. In fact, Adler says Nike ran a tennis campaign back in the ’90s called “Guerrilla Tennis. ” Adler says ESPN understood what he meant but made him apologize anyway, only to fire him a short time later. Adler says he’s screwed professionally because of the way his termination played out in the media, saying, “No one will hire a ‘racist. ’” For the record, Adler says he’s “anything but a racist. ” He’s suing for unspecified damages. Here’s the video of the “guerilla” ad campaign Adler referenced: Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
