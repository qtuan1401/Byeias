NBA Commissioner Adam Silver addressed rumors that the NBA could move its 2017   game out Charlotte, NC to protest the controversial North Carolina bill that requires public school and university students to use public bathrooms according to their biological sex.  Silver called the law “problematic for the league. ” He also said that he is working with Charlotte Hornets ownership seeking to “effect change in North Carolina. ” “The law as it now stands in North Carolina is problematic for the league. There was no discussion of moving the   game. What the view in the room was, we should be working towards change in North Carolina. I have been working very closely with the Charlotte Hornets, with Fred Whitfield who’s the president of the team and together with ownership down there to seek to effect change in North Carolina,” Silver said.
