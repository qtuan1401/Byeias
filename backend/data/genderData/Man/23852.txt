The South Korean government revealed Wednesday that it had fired 20 machine gun rounds at an unidentified drone widely believed to have come from North Korea that had entered South Korean territory. The incident follows international condemnation of a weapons test Pyongyang claims was the successful detonation of a hydrogen bomb. [South Korean military officials initially attempted to make contact with the drone and warn it not to cross into South Korean territory. The drone continued its trajectory, CNN notes, until South Korean soldiers fired the warning shots, after which the drone immediately turned around, flying back towards North Korea.  Others were more profane. “Don’t get caught up with bitch Park Keun Hye’s   Korea provocations that only bring calamitous results. Only miserable death awaits for those who slander their same people,” read one. North Korean official state media has repeatedly referred to the South Korean president as “bitch,” notably in the   column series, “We Accuse Park the Bitch. ” New sanctions, Park said Wednesday, must be “strong enough to change North Korea’s attitude. ” “We will make every effort for the strongest sanctions against North Korea by taking new actions. China’s role is significant here,” she added, pressing China to “play its role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. ” While China has previously blocked sanctions at the Security Council, it has issued stern condemnations of North Korea’s latest nuclear test. The Chinese government’s words appear to have reached Pyongyang, as evidence has surfaced that at least one   Chinese official has been “disappeared” from North Korean propaganda.
