 (CNN) How many times can you pull off the same disappearing act? An unlimited number of times    if youâ€™re Chinese artist Liu Bolin.  For over a decade, Liu has continued to work within the same unique medium    camouflaging himself into various backgrounds with the aim of raising awareness on political and societal issues. He has built up an impressive arsenal of works, is well received on the international art circuit, and has extended his work to commercial ventures    including collaborations with top fashion houses. His most recent series, Art Hacker, is inspired by classic works of art.  See highlights from his work in the gallery above.
