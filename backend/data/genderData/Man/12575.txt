We’re endangered now on fronts that were inconceivable eight years ago. ” He went on to call the decline “systematic” and “reflective of the Obama ideology, that the United States historically has been as much of the problem as it’s been the solution, that we’re just one nation among many, not exceptional in any respect. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
