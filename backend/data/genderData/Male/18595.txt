Former Assemblyman and current congressional candidate Tim Donnelly believes Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom’s gun control ballot initiative will serve to drive GOP voters to the voting booth, thereby providing a boon for GOP candidates. [Donnelly explained his theory by pointing to the 1982 gubernatorial election, an election in which “a strong turnout of voters opposed to a   measure   …     helped Republican George Deukmejian defeat Democrat Tom Bradley. ”  According to The Sacramento Bee, Donnelly believes the gains possible for the GOP are so great that Newsom’s      approach will end up as “a warning to the left. ” Newsom is seeking to outlaw all ammunition magazines in California that exceed the   limit Elliot Rodger used in his May 2014 Santa Barbara attack. Moreover, Newsom’s initiative also seeks to implement background checks for all   ammunition purchasers. Donnelly said he believes Californians are waking up to the fact that     is an empty promise. The Santa Barbara attack and more recent San Bernardino attacks occurred in spite of myriad gun controls, not for lack of them. Donnelly said: I am not going to call it   legislation. What it is is   legislation because, essentially, people have figured out that the government can’t and won’t protect us. So the only way we could do that is protect ourselves. That means we have to have the ability to keep and bear arms. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
