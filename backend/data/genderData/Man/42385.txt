 (CNN) Take note, aspiring singers: You never know who might be listening.    Sydney Bourbeau was singing the Ed Sheeran hit ”Thinking Out Loud” at the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta on Sunday when the pop star jumped on stage to join her. It turns out Sheeran was in a store nearby when he heard the familiar tune and decided to do an impromptu duet.  Lucky for us, Sheeran’s cousin Murray Cummings recorded the moment, even joking on Twitter that the star had ruined Bourbeau’s performance.   Bourbeau, who was performing as part of her music school’s fundraiser for the Edmonton Humane Society, told the Edmonton Journal that she couldn’t believe it when Sheeran showed up. ”I was like, should I stop? I didn’t want to stop, but I wanted to talk to him,” the young singer said. ”This is, like, the best thing that’s ever happened to me.” Michael Cathrea, president of Resonate Music School and Studio, which hosted the fundraiser, told the Journal that the school did not know that Sheeran would be in the mall and that the fundraiser was not planned to coincide with the Grammy nominee’s concert that weekend. Sheeran’s generosity didn’t stop with the singing. His manager later contacted Bourbeau and invited her to the concert.
