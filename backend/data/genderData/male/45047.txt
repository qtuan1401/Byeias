Miller, who plays   Erlich Bachman, would be leaving the show after the current   fourth season.  ’ ’   Over at  Miller explained why he decided to leave the show,   which he called an amicable split. ’ ’   “I would love to do ’’The Emoji Movie’’ and things like that and   have the time to develop animated features,” Miller said. ”I   would like to keep offering up [Comedy Central’s ’’The Gorburger   Show’’] and letting people see a very different side of talk show   guests. And that was a big part of why I said, ‘I’ve learned   everything I can from this show. ’’ I would love to continue to be   involved with it, if only because fans really do enjoy the show,   and they seem to enjoy the character. But ultimately I just have   to make more things and different things. ’” ’ ’   Along with voicing a character in the upcoming movie, ”The Emoji   Movie,” and his talk show series, ”The Gorburger Show,” Miller is   also starring in ”Deadpool 2,” and Steven Spielberg’’s anticipated   movie, ”Ready Player One.” ’ ’Fans of the popular HBO series ”Silicon Valley”. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
