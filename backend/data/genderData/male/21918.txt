California rapper Snoop Dogg is teaming up with longtime TV personality Martha Stewart to host a new cooking show on VH1 this fall. [The   weekly series Martha  Snoop’s Dinner Party  —   ordered straight to series by the network  —   will see Stewart and Snoop cooking and hosting dinner parties for their famous friends, according to Variety.  “We’re thrilled to partner with Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg, two of pop culture’s biggest icons,” VH1 and Logo president Chris McCarthy said in a statement. “Good parties are filled with fun, food and unexpected guests. Wait til you see what happens at ‘Martha and Snoop’s Dinner Party’ it will be unforgettable. ” Incidentally, the     legend and the homemaking maven have joined forces on TV in the past. In November 2008, the Martha Stewart Show host invited Snoop on to help make her mother’s mashed potatoes. The rapper came on the show again in December 2009 to bake Christmas brownies. The two were also recently paired on ABC’s revival of $100, 000 Pyramid. “At our dinner party, we will exemplify America’s fascination with food, entertaining and celebrity,” Stewart said in a statement. “Martha  Snoop’s Dinner Party will redesign the traditional food competition shows in a new, different and very funny way. ” Added Snoop: “My homegirl, Martha and I have a special bond that goes back. We’re gonna be cooking, drinking and having a good time with our exclusive friends. Can’t wait for you to see how we roll together!” Martha  Snoop’s Dinner Party is the second television project in which Snoop is currently involved. He’s also set to executive produce the scripted   comedy Mary + Jane, premiering in September on MTV. The rapper is currently out on his “High Road Tour” with fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa.
