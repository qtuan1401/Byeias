Former Sen. Alfonse D’Amato ( ) said Sunday on New York AM 970 radio show “The Cats Roundtable” that he is concerned about “riotous conditions” outside of the Republican National Convention.  “I am concerned about what will take place outside of the convention. I think you’re gonna see the same kind of desperados and groups who, in California, were flying Mexican flags, burning American flags,” D’Amato told host John Catsimatidis. “Some of the hooligans will be armed, and I think they’ll look to create real trouble there. I think you’re going to have riotous conditions outside caused by these absolute degenerates who don’t give a darn about this country and are trying to rip us apart. ” D’Amato added that Cleveland may need to add more police to the area or else a “horrendous situation” could unfold around Quicken Loans Arena, the site of the convention.
