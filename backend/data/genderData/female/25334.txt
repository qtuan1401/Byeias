Thursday on AM 970’s “The Joe Piscopo Show,” Rep. Peter King ( ) criticized Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) calling him a “phony” and saying his supporters in New York would need their heads examined.  King said, “Let me say something about the New York primary, any New Yorker who even thinks of voting for Ted Cruz should have their head examined. Oh no Really, here’s a guy who refused to sign onto the   health care act for the cops and fireman. Here’s a guy who talks about New York values. To me, New York values is what people did after    —   the cops the fireman, the National guard units that were over in Iraq and Afghanistan. ” He continued, “New York keeps going froward. We’re tough, and to have some guy like Ted Cruz with cowboy boots walk around criticizing us. So listen, I hope he gets the cold shoulder and other things from every New Yorker. Send him back where he belongs. And he’s a phony,” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
