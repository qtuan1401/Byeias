Thursday at her weekly press briefing, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said if the Republican Party rejects the will of the voters and does not nominate the eventual   Republican presidential candidate, Democrats would reap the benefits in November.  Pelosi said, “So I do believe the person that wins in the public arena  —   in the campaigns —   will be the person who will be our nominee. On the Republican side, where they really don’t have so much as super delegates, I dont think they have any. On the Republican side, if they reject the public will, they will really hand us a bigger victory than I’m even anticipating now, because that will be an implosion of the Republican Party. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
