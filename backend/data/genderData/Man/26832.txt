Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino had his hand and footprints immortalized in front of the iconic TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles this week however, he left his mark in an unusual way. [The controversial —  and often vulgar —  Hateful Eight director left a subtle “F —  k you” written on the sidewalk in front of the historic Hollywood landmark.  According to CBS Los Angeles, Tarantino became the the 292nd artist to leave his impression in wet cement at the location on Tuesday morning. TMZ reported Wednesday Tarantino celebrated the occasion by wearing a pair of shoes with the letters “    U” imprinted in the soles. The shoes were reportedly replicas of the same pair Uma Thurman’s character wore in his 2003 hit movie Kill Bill: Vol. 1. Tarantino’s impression joins those of stars like Clark Gable, Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, and Clint Eastwood, who are all displayed in the sidewalk in front of the theater. The honor came less than a month after Tarantino received the 2, 569th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The director was joined at the Chinese Theatre by actors Channing Tatum, Christoph Waltz, Robert Forster, Uma Thurman, and Tim Roth. No word yet on whether or not Tarantino’s impression will be allowed to stay, according to TMZ. Formerly known as Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, the film venue first opened its doors in 1927 and is a hot spot for tourists.
