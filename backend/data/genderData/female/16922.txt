Sunday during the Democratic Debate on NBC, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was asked by host Lester Holt how he would win a general election while labeling himself a “Democratic Socialist. ”  “The Democratic party needs major reform,” he replied. “To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a   strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need. Instead of being dependent on Super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and   people. Not wealthy campaign contributors. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
