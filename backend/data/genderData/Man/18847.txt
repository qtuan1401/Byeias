On a special edition of Breitbart News Daily entitled “The Global War on Christianity,” Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon interviewed legal editor Ken Klukowski, who is also senior counsel and director of strategic affairs for First Liberty Institute, the largest law firm in the United States dedicated exclusively to protecting religious liberty for Americans. [Asked how widespread attacks on Christianity are, Klukowski said the attacks are “proliferating,” adding, “If people go to my law firm’s website, firstliberty. org, they can download a new book from us, called Undeniable, which documents over 1, 200 separate instances of hostility to Christians in the United States because of their faith. ”  As Klukowski recounted various examples, Bannon responded that they were “making my head blow up,” and he urged listeners to visit the website to get more information. Bannon and Klukowski discussed several issues, such as the organized effort to purge religious faith from the U. S. military. He also mentioned Aaron and Melissa Klein —  the Oregon bakers who for reasons of conscience could not participate in a   wedding with a cake and are being punished by the government. Kuklowski also brought up the  persecution of Christians in Syria and the   West Bank region of Israel. The entire interview is available here: Ken Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.
