Former UN Ambassador John Bolton told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon he would “be in jail right now” if he did what Hillary Clinton did, adding, he has seen people who handled much less sensitive information “prosecuted and not only their careers ruined, but put in jail for far less than this. ”[Concerning FBI Director Comey’s decision not to recommend prosecution for Hillary Clinton, he thought “it was cowardice on Comey’s part. ” He said:  I hope that the questioning he’s going to get today on the House side —  and I’m sure there will be other hearings as well —  can help penetrate it because even to give Comey the benefit of the doubt to say he was trying to protect the FBI, I think he has harmed the FBI in a very serious way. As for Hillary Clinton and the State Department, said Bolton: I think there is a systemic problem at the State Department, a lack of concern for classified information. Comey referred to that in his statement on Tuesday. But that doesn’t exonerate the Clintons or anybody else. In fact, given that Hillary Clinton was the secretary of state, it was her obligation to change that culture. And instead, through the email server and a number of other things she did, she made the culture even worse. Bolton also called Comey’s statement “schizophrenic,” saying, “In the first   he was almost giving a kind of opening statement to the jury in a prosecution that should have been brought against Hillary and a number of her aides. ” He added, “And then in the last third, he basically said they weren’t going to do it because of factors that he named that were utterly irrelevant to a decision whether to go forward with a case. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
