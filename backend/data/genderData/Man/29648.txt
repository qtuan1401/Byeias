MSNBC’s “Hardball” host Chris Matthews stated that he doesn’t get Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy with regards to the Iraq War, Libya, and Syria on Tuesday.  Matthews said, “My hit list begins with, why did we go into Iraq? My list, by the way, continues along your line with why we messed around with Gaddafi. Why did we get involved with overthrowing a government without any idea of the bedlam to come? And what side are we on in Syria? Please tell me somebody, please tell me what we want to happen in Syria, because I don’t get it. I don’t get Hillary’s foreign policy in any of those three regards. ” (  The Right Scoop) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
