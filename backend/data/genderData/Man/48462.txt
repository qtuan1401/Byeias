’  ’ ’  ’ ’    ’ ’  ’ ’     “Ships get arrested on occasion, and container companies have     gone bust in the past, but the difference here is a matter of     scale,” says James Baker, editor of Containerisation     International, a publication of the British shipping     journal .     “We’ve never seen such a larger line go down so comprehensively     in such a large way. ”   ’ ’     These “,” which     typically carry crews of about 15 to 25, are now starting to     run low on food and water while the company’s managers scramble     to find a solution.  for Hanjin ships in Sydney and Singapore as creditors     try to recover unpaid bills.   ’ ’     Hanjin that it     would spend about 90 million dollars, with more than a third of     that coming from its chairman’s personal assets, to help     resolve the disruption, but that sum still falls short of what     it will take just to unload the cargo currently on its vessels;     the South Korean government may have to step in with more     financing. The company’s lawyers are tying to arrange legal     cover in dozens of countries for the ships to dock.   ’ ’     A U. S. judge  to bring     the company under the umbrella of U. S. bankruptcy protection,     allowing ships to dock in the States without the company’s     assets being seized. But the cargo on those ships, including     toys, tires, clothes, and computers, probably won’t make it to     stores, since railroads and truckers don’t want to touch Hanjin     containers without guarantees they’ll be paid. Most of the     vessels are  of major     ports, awaiting instructions.   ’ ’     While Hanjin’s bankruptcy has stranded boats and roiled     boardrooms, consumers probably won’t notice the effects of the     mess. “I don’t think the shelves are going to be empty at     Christmastime. It will get sorted,” says Baker. Hanjin’s     competitors will be more than happy to swoop in and take the     business Hanjin vacated. Share prices for South Korea’s other     major shipper, Hyundai Merchant Marine,  and other     lines have  to pick up     Asian cargo in the wake of Hanjin’s collapse.   ’ ’  ’ ’       As for the ships themselves, some are merely operated under       charter by Hanjin and will revert back to their original       owners. Those that are actually owned by the company will be       sold off. Which means that the shipping industry’s biggest       underlying problem —  overcapacity —  isn’t going away.     ’ ’       Essentially, the global supply of ships has been growing much       faster than the amount of goods that need to be shipped.       According to a  global   capacity grew by 8. 6 percent       in 2015, a year when global trade grew by only 2. 6 percent.     ’ ’       Despite low demand, companies continue to order         vessels. Shipping capacity is measured in “        equivalent units” with the largest ships able to transport       more than 18, 000 TEUs. In the 12 months through May 2016, the       number of these   vessels increased to 37 from 22.       The next class down, 14, 000 to 18, 000 TEUs, increased from 51       to 70.     ’ ’       Larger ships are far more efficient and drive down the rates       that their operators can afford to charge manufacturers,       which has led to a race to the bottom: Supply now vastly       outstrips demand, and shipping rates are sitting at         lows.     ’ ’       “It’s very much a commoditized industry. A box is a box is a       box,” says Moody’s analyst Maria Maslovsky. “It really       doesn’t matter from a customer perspective who moves it as       long as it’s reliable. So for the container liners, the       primary thing is to provide reliable service. There’s this       ongoing race to keep the fleet young and large, which doesn’t       help the capacity issue. ”     ’ ’         How did we get here? “Hubris and ego and insanity in the         shipping industry,” says Baker. “It happens over and over         again, cycle after cycle. Thus it was and ever will be. ”         The arms race was ignited by wildly optimistic global trade         forecasts made in the waning days of the global recession,         notably by Denmark’s Maersk, the world’s largest shipping         company. What they didn’t count on was China’s recent         economic slowdown. “We had a generation of people working         in shipping that have lived under the China effect,” says         Baker, referring to the years when the country’s         construction boom and skyrocketing manufacturing sector         kept the global commodities market humming. “To a large         degree, everyone thought it would remain like that. ”       ’ ’  ’ ’         There’s also the impact of the recent . The locks of the canal, originally built in         1914, used to limit the size of ships passing through it to           Panamax size —  about 3, 000 to 5, 000 TEUs. But the         recent expansion of the canal has spurred companies to         build newer, bigger,   ships.       ’ ’Not surprisingly, the         global shipping slowdown is cause for alarm in Panama,         which spent $5. 25 billion on the canal retrofit, a plan         approved more than a decade ago under very different global         economic circumstances. Egypt has also spent more than $8         billion, raised by selling investment certificates to           citizens, to improve the Suez Canal, a                  promoted by President Abdel Fattah  . Traffic through the canal has dropped         since its expansion. Then  over a troubled Chinese project to build a         second Central American canal in Nicaragua, which is         looking less likely to actually happen by the day. “I don’t         think Nicaragua will ever happen,” says Baker. “I’ve joked         that if it opens in my lifetime I’ll swim the length of         it. ”       ’ ’         As for the shipping industry’s woes, the obvious solution         would be to just scrap a large amount of capacity, giving         more business to the on the coast of Bangladesh. Scrapping is         increasing, but companies are still reluctant to do this,         since iron ore prices are also low due to China’s slump.         It’s cheaper to let the ships float rather than melt them         down, so at the moment many companies are simply having         them do nothing. A record 352 500+  ships are          around the world. An estimated 25 percent of the world’s         container capacity .       ’ ’         The Hanjin situation also raises the question of whether         more companies will follow. Baker says a cascade effect         from the bankruptcy is likely but that it certainly isn’t         the only company in trouble. “The next big issue is Japan,”         says Baker. “They have too many shipping companies for         their own good and far more than needed. ”       ’ ’           Shipping, as an industry, isn’t going anywhere, of           course. Nearly 80 percent of the world’s goods and           commodities still travel by ship. “The way the global           economy is organized now, most of the goods are not           produced in the place where they’re consumed, so they           need to be moved, and ocean shipping is the most             way to do it,” says Maslovskt I think the           overcapacity is something that will persist for some           time. I don’t think there’s a quick and easy fix for it. ”         ’ ’           For the time being, hundreds of ships will continue to           sit idle on the world’s oceans, waiting for something to           carry across them.         ’
