London (CNN) If you don’t want to be heard making soft cooing noises in the middle of the office, best to save this story for later. Prince William and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, have released four new official photographs from the christening of Princess Charlotte, who was born on May 2.  The photographs were taken by Mario Testino in the gardens and drawing room at Sandringham House after Charlotte’s baptism at the Church of St Mary Magdalene on Sunday. The pictures are unbearably cute, certain to provoke oohs and ahhs among those prone to making such sounds when they view photographs of babies. Photos posted on Instagram, In one, all four members of the family    including Prince George, who is closing in on age 2    pose together. In another, Charlotte, swathed in lace, lies cradled in her mother’s arms and looking at the camera. Party princess or dutiful daughter: The difficult life of the ’spare heir’ Testino, the photographer, did some oohing and ahhing of his own on his Instagram account. ”I am overwhelmed and honoured to be chosen to take these portraits on the occasion of Princess Charlotte’s christening, to carry on the documentation of the family that is the soul of this country, a country that has given me so much,” he wrote. Testino is a Peruvian photographer who, among other career highlights, was chosen by Princess Diana in 1997 to photograph her for Vanity Fair.
