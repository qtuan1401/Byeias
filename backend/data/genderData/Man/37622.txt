 (CNN) Almanzor continued its blistering 2016 with an upset win at  Leopardstown, narrowly edging last year’s   Found at the finish line.  Almanzor got off to a slow start, but came from behind on the outside track and raced neck and neck with Found until breaking ahead with no time to spare.  Favorite Minding finished third, while English and Irish Derby winner Harzand, who was also expected to place, finished further back.  Minding, the   favorite, had six major wins to her name before going into the race, including the Nassau Stakes and the Pretty Polly Stakes.  It was Almanzor’s fourth victory of the year, following its impressive run at the French Derby in June. The horse was jockeyed by Christophe Soumillon and trained by   Rouget for owner Ecurie Antonio Caro.
