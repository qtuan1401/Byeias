President Barack Obama revealed his 2016 NCAA basketball tournament brackets hours before revealing his choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. [Obama has made an annual spectacle of his bracket picks, leading critics to content that he spends more time on basketball, and on pop culture in general, than he does on addressing the nation’s urgent priorities.  This year, as Breitbart Sports reported, Obama chose a conventional bracket, choosing just one upset (Hawaii over California) and picking Kansas to win it all. His Final Four for the men’s side are Kansas, Texas AM, North Carolina, and Michigan State. On Friday, Obama revealed his “final three” Supreme Court candidates, including frontrunner Sri Srinivasan, who grew up in Kansas. It seemed possible Obama might pick Kansas to win twice in one day. But in the end, he chose Merrick Garland, Srinivasan’s colleague on the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
