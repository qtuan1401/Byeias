”Cartier’s New York beauty is shining once again.” ”The French brand’s flagship boutique in New York City reopened in September after two and a half years of extensive renovations.” ’The building, which dates back to 1905, was originally a   mansion home to the Plant family, and is situated on 52nd Street and 5th Avenue. As the area became the commercial corridor we know it as today, the Plants moved uptown and sold the house to Cartier in 1917.’
