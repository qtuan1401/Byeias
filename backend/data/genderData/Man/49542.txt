’  ’ ”   The Kansas City Chiefs beat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday,     thanks to a   interception return by Eric Berry on a   Falcons’   conversion attempt late in the fourth   quarter.  ” ’   Because the NFL only changed the rule to allow defenses to   score   conversions in 2015, Berry’’s returned marked the   first ” ” ever. And it won them the game.  ’ ’   With 4:37 left in the fourth, the Falcons found the back of the   end zone to take the lead,  . They tried to go for two to   push their lead to three, and instead wound up down one   point. ’ ”   Here’s the play:  ” ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’t1) ATL scores TD, takes lead2) ATL goes for 23) Berry PICKS IT OFF, goes the distanceKC takes the lead. UNREAL!  ’ ’   Along with his   Berry also intercepted Matt Ryan in the   first half and took it to the house. He was responsible for eight   Kansas City points, and is the first player this season to have   two   plays.  ’ ”   After Berry’s play, Chiefs got the ball back and ran the   clock out to win. It’s a massive win, too: they’re now     comfortably in possession of a wild card spot and (if the Raiders   lose) will take over atop the AFC West.  ”
