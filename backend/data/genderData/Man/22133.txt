Monday on ABC’s “The View,” while commenting the Orlando mass shooting that killed 50 people,   Whoopi Goldberg railed against the Second Amendment of the Constitution arguing the Constitution doesn’t “say you can carry hundreds of guns. ”  Goldberg said, “It’s about a lot of different things, you know. It’s about an amendment in the Constitution that people misread. The Constitution doesn’t say you can carry hundreds of guns. It says you can protect your home. It says you can protect yourself. It doesn’t say get 55 guns  —   or military style  —  you know, people say, well, we need to have our guns because we can go shoot  —   you can’t hunt anything with an assault rifle. There’s nothing left after you can’t do it. you  —   it’s gone and not for nothing, all you people on Twitter that like to come after folks, back up, because you can’t explain this.  You can’t explain this away. You couldn’t explain it in Sandy Hook. You can’t explain it here. There’s no reason for anybody to have a machine gun basically to do that  —   I’m sorry. So keep your stuff to yourself. I don’t care what you think. Back off me, I don’t care. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
