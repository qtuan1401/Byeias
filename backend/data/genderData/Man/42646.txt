The photos showed his face and   outstretched arms illuminated, first, by a North African desert, and, captured just a few moments later, by the Mediterranean Sea.  The space station travels at five mile per seconds, and is the   object in the sky after the sun and the moon, outshining Venus. You can even spot it at night if you look up at the right time. Kelly is on a   mission to study the impacts of prolonged weightlessness    or the absence of gravity    on the human body. The New Jersey native is joined by Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka on board, and his twin brother, former astronaut Mark Kelly, on Earth.  Scientists will gather and compare data about the Kelly brothers to identify physical and mental changes in the body caused by   spaceflight. The information collected from these studies will be used for future missions to Mars, which would take at least 2. 5 years.
