The shooter at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, whom the abortion business and its allies have claimed is a “domestic terrorist” member of the   community, is mentally incompetent and unfit to stand trial, said psychologists who evaluated him. [One of two state psychologists who assessed Robert Dear, 57, and concluded he was not fit to stand trial says he suffers from “widespread and   delusions that shaped his view of reality,” reported The New York Times. Dear believed the FBI had been following him for years and that the judge and his own defense attorneys were conspiring to keep him quiet.  According to NBC News, Dear’s paranoid delusions led him to live in a trailer with no electricity in the mountains of Colorado so he could be left alone. He reportedly also believes his longtime girlfriend had become a government spy. “He cannot trust anyone, basically,” testified Thomas Gray, one of the psychologists who evaluated Dear. “He’s quick to include anyone into that list of suspect individuals. ” Dear acknowledged he killed three people at the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic. He is charged with 179 counts, including murder, attempted murder, and assault. Nine people were also injured during the November 27 shootings. Immediately after the shootings, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains attempted to blame the   community for provoking Dear to commit the shootings. The abortion facility released a statement via Twitter, which said, “Extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country. ”
