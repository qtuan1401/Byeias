A group of kids in Wyandotte, Michigan, organized a car wash to help a man who is homeless and down on his luck. [A neighborhood resident named Shannon Isa told FOX 2 that a group of children were outside washing her car, when a man named Larry passed by them on his bike.  Larry is a local resident who had suffered a heart attack about a month ago. As if things were not bad enough for Larry, his house burned down while he was in the hospital recovering. He has been living on the streets ever since, with nowhere else to go. “I made him a big sandwich, a fruit cup and some yogurt and when I brought it out to him, he started crying, and I think that really touched everyone, all the kids especially,” Isa said. The kids, Isa said, began to think of ways they could do more to help Larry. That’s when they came up with the idea to organize a massive neighborhood car wash. “We just asked the neighbor, Ms. Kelly, to clean her car for $5 for the [fundraiser],” said Joshua Cagle. What started out as a five dollar endeavor quickly turned into a $500 undertaking after information about the car wash was shared on the Downriver and Friends Facebook Page. Downriver and Friends is a   member “community group that supports the people, places and things of Downriver, Michigan, and our friends in surrounding areas,” according to the group’s information page on Facebook. “The kids are really excited they’re non stop. I thought they’d run out of steam by now, but, not so much,” Isa said about the fundraiser. Larry will reportedly receive additional help from a local shelter called Nimi’s Mission. “I’m really proud of the community for coming out and coming together to help this guy, and I can’t wait for us to organize something for us to give this to him,” Isa says.
