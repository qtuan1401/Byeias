The Clinton campaign posted the tax returns to their website on Friday afternoon, along with an itemized list of all the paid speeches Clinton and her husband delivered in 2013. With this release, the campaign says 38 years of Clinton tax returns have been available to the press over the course of her career, dating back to 1977. Not all of the tax returns are currently online, but a campaign official said the tax forms were made available during the Clintons’ first run at elected office. Charitable donations, From 2007 to 2014, nearly 99% of the Clintons’ charitable giving went to their foundation, ”The Clinton Family Foundation,” which is used to distribute the family’s philanthropic giving to different charities. In total, the Clintons donated $14, 959, 450. 00 to charity over that period, with $14, 769, 000 of that going to the foundation. And most of the 1% of donations that didn’t go to their foundation went to Clinton associated groups. In 2013, the Clintons donated $57, 000 to the Clinton Global Initiative and $21, 000 to the Humana Challenge, a Clinton   golf tournament. In 2012, the couple donated $25, 000 to the same golf tournament. But there are donations to more seemingly random charities. In 2014, the Clintons gave $2, 500 to St. Stephen’s Armenian Apostolic Church and $20, 000 to First Methodist Church. They also gave $200 to Hot Springs High School Class of 1964. Bill Clinton attended his high school reunion that year in Arkansas. In 2012, the couple gave $650 to ”various” charities that were not itemized. And in 2007, they gave $4, 100 to the Exploring the Arts Foundation and $60, 000 to the Nelson Mandela Foundation. Clinton knocks Bush, Rubio, By comparison, campaign aides were quick to note, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush released 33 years of tax returns last month. Clinton, who has been more willing to go after Republicans of late, used the release of her tax documents to tout her tax principles and knock Republicans.

She also revisited past proposals she has made, including raising the   capital gains tax on top earners. ”I want more Americans to have the chance to work hard and get ahead, just like we did. And reforming the tax code can help,” she wrote before noting ”we hear very different principles from the Republican candidates running for President.” ”They want to give me another tax cut I don’t need instead of putting middle class families first,” Clinton wrote before hitting Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio by name. ”Jeb Bush supports eliminating or dramatically lowering capital gains taxes for wealthy investors with no incentives for   holding. Marco Rubio’s plan would cut taxes for households making more than $3 million a year by almost $240, 000    more than four times the earnings of a typical family. That’s a     to the   and the sort of bad economics you’re likely to get from any of the Republican candidates.”
