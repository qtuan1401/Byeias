Syria’s Ministry of Tourism has released a video highlighting the possibility of holidays in   Aleppo. Set to the Game of Thrones theme music, the one   clip shot by an overflying drone boasts lush parks and greenery, clear blue skies, and towering minarets. [The new promotional tool has been released with the title “Aleppo  …    Will of Life” to showcase the   areas of west Aleppo which have largely remained untouched by the brutal civil war that has engulfed the rest of the city.  The clip ignores the loss of human life and appalling carnage being experienced elsewhere within Aleppo’s city boundaries. It comes as civilians under bombardment in east Aleppo are facing “a level of savagery that no human should have to endure,” the UN aid chief said Sunday. The video was posted on the ministry’s Facebook page  —   which is also promoting a festival in the   city this weekend  —   boasting the hashtag #Aleppo_Will_Of_Life. A bizarre tweet from Syria’s official news agency also showed people partying at an outdoor dance music event, seeming to claim that life continues as normal in Aleppo despite the killing and terror that is the signature of the Syria civil war.
