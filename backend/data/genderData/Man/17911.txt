Friday on MSNBC when asked about the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from a hack of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee ( ) mistakenly denounced the free online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, instead of WikiLeaks.  Jackson Lee said, “You know, I’m going to first of all denounce the utilization of this intrusion by Wikipedia through the Russian intrusion. This is what it’s about. Espionage just like what was said over these last couple of days. We need to be concerned about the intrusion of Russia and Putin in these elections. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
