Veteran actor Martin Sheen will produce and narrate a new documentary television series exploring new evidence in the infamous O. J. Simpson case that producers say could be enough to prove that the former football star was completely innocent of any crime.  Investigation Discovery has greenlit the documentary Hard Evidence: O. J. Is Innocent for a   series slated to premiere early next year, according to Variety. The project is reportedly based on the   investigative work on the Simpson case done by   private investigator William Dear, who authored the 2012 book O. J. Is Innocent and I Can Prove It. The new series comes as interest in the case has reignited following the debut of the popular FX limited series The People vs. O. J. Simpson earlier this year. “Hard Evidence is just that  —   it may be hard for many of us to accept a fresh perspective and new angle to the story that has transfixed our nation for decades,” Investigation Discovery group president Henry Schleiff said in a statement. “With an intriguing theory based on new and never disclosed details, Hard Evidence will leave viewers   everything they have ever known about the case, questioning yet again  —   did he do it?” Simpson was memorably acquitted in the deaths of his   Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman during what became a   trial in  . But that hasn’t stopped the success of fictionalized series like The People vs. O. J. Simpson, which marks its series finale on Tuesday. In his own statement, Dear said his decades of work on the case has turned up new evidence, including the existence of a previously “undiscovered eyewitness. ” “This revealing series will now show you what may have really happened based upon all the facts, so for the first time, you will be able to judge for yourself,” the investigator said. “I am certain viewers will be shocked to learn who O. J. may have actually been covering up for. ” No release date for the series has been set.
