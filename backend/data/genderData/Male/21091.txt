In a preview from and interview that will air on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Vice President Joe Biden defended Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private unsecured email server during her tenure as secretary of state for the Obama administration.  Biden said, “Well, I think it’s a combination of a couple of things. One, I don’t think she understood the gravity of setting it up. She thought it was you know this is okay to do. This woman has been so battered over 30 years. I think then when faced with, ‘This is a problem,’ I think instead of just cutting it and dealing with it immediately, there’s always an inclination to overthink it. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
