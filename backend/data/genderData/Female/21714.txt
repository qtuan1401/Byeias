Reynolds with invasion of privacy after Target department store workers said they saw him placing a basket with a mirror attached to it on the floor next to female shoppers and using the mirror to look up the dresses and skirts of unsuspecting female shoppers.  According to Ocean PD Detective Lt. Timothy Torchia, Reynolds was arrested on May 16 and is being held at Monmouth County Correctional Institution on a $7, 500 bail.
