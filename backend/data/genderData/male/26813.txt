Almost 94 percent of donations by Ivy League university employees since 2012 have gone to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. [The data analyzed by Campus Reform revealed that contributions to political campaigns from Ivy League employees have totaled almost $12 million since 2012. Just $1, 283, 151, or six percent, of the $11, 688, 209 in donations were given to political groups outside the Democratic Party.  In this year’s election cycle, Democrats have received $3, 536, 424 in donations, compared to just $230, 610 received by the GOP. That’s just 6. 1 percent of the donations for the GOP. Harvard University has been the principal contributor to Democratic causes, with $4 million in donations from Harvard employees. Those donations comprise more than 25 percent of total Ivy League donations. The findings should come as little surprise, as the   bias at American universities are well documented. The majority of university establishments actively discriminate against conservatives with regard to holding events on campus.
