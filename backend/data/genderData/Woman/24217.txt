Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Outnumbered,” while discussing the possibility of Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton being indicted as a result of the current FBI investigation into her handling of classified material on an unsecured email server during her tenure as secretary of state, Fox News senior political contributor Brit Hume said there were enough questions about the circumstances of Clinton’s case that an indictment isn’t a slam dunk.  Partial transcript as follows: HUME: Worth remembering, David Petraeus was convicted of a misdemeanor. Now that was bargained down no doubt. But if you look at —  I read various legal analyses of these —  and a good case can be made there is an indictable felony here, and very good case can also be made there is not. My guess is that she won’t be indicted. HARRIS: Agreed. HUME: Think about this for a minute. If you come down to it, and she is nominated by one of the major parties, and you have not a huge case, and you don’t have any criminal intent, are you going to indict? Is it wise to indict a nominee of a major party? Is that the right way to do it? Is that the right thing to do? HARRIS: Well it is if there is a crime. TANTAROS: Not only that, Brit, the fact that her staff took the classified information and moved it to a public server, and then the conspiracy to try and hide it, that alone is a felony punishable up to 10 years. HUME: It is. Who is likely to be indicted?  I think  —   (cross talk) TANTAROS: I agree she won’t get indicted. (cross talk) HUME: They might indict members of her staff. Whether they will indict her I think is very much in doubt. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
