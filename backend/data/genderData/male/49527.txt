’  ’ ”   In some ways, kids are weird   like in the way they   blurt out whatever they’re thinking and think a joke is even   funnier the twelfth time you tell it. ” ’   In other ways, kids are just  . Motivation is a key   example of this similarity: The things that encourage us to   perform better at work are the same things that encourage them to   . ’ ’   That’’s according to Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and   behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of the new   book on human motivation, ”.”   Ariely visited the Business Insider office in November and   explained that the best way to motivate kids  —   or really, anyone    —   to achieve success is to praise their effort over the   outcome. ’ ”   That means that when your kid studies hard for a spelling test   but comes home with a C, you’ll still want to let them know that   you recognize and applaud their effort. (You might also want to   diagnose what went wrong and see how you can help them improve   next time.) ” ”   Here’s Ariely: ” ’’ ’   ”Often what we do is we reward or punish the outcome. And we do   it in the business world as well: We  if what they did was successful,   regardless of whether the process was good or bad.” ’ ’   This strategy, Ariely added, is a mistake. He went on: ’ ”   Ariely’s insights recall research by the psychologist Carol   Dweck, who has found that  especially in kids, can result   in greater success. In fact, kids that receive praise for being   smart can end up steering clear of challenges later on. ” ”   Ariely acknowledged that it can be tempting when you’re talking   to your kid (or your employee) to tell them how smart and   talented they are. But it’s important to keep in mind the   potential   outcome of this kind of interaction. ” ’   Said Ariely: ”It’’s true for kids; it’’s true for adults. It’’s   harder to do, which is why we don’’t do it. But it it is the right   way.” ’
