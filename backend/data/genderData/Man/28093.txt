Twitter has reinstated the account of the hacker responsible for the latest Democratic Party leak, Guccifer 2. 0, after previously suspending him in what was seen as a politically motivated move. [The hack, which revealed information such as personal cell phone numbers and email addresses of senior Democrats as well as information from Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s private computer, was another blow to the Clinton campaign, following WikiLeaks’ release of over 19, 000 emails from the DNC which revealed their tactics in trying to derail the Bernie Sanders campaign.  However following Breitbart‘s coverage of the suspension, Twitter has once again backtracked on its decision and lifted the ban. #Guccifer2 Here I am! They’ll have to try much harder to block me! #DNCleak #dccchack,  —   GUCCIFER 2. 0 (@GUCCIFER_2) August 14, 2016,  Twitter has refused to disclose the reason for banning Guccifer or why he was reinstated. The company is known for its disdain of conservative voices under CEO Jack Dorsey, as well as its disdain for conservative media. Alleged political bias at the company recently flared into a major issue again after the recent permanent suspension of Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos. On returning to the site, Guccifer wrote, “Here I am! They’ll have to try much harder to block me!” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos. net
