Former U. S. Secret Service agent Dan Bongino spoke to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Monday morning about Hillary Clinton’s medical condition. [Asked for his thoughts on a seemingly incapacitated Hillary Clinton being dragged into a van by Secret Service agents Sunday morning, Bongino said, “This  is severe. I was in the Secret Service for twelve years. I must have done security, or been part of a security plan, at close to   sites, if not more. I’ve never seen a protectee go down like that, ever. ”  Continued Bongino: I’ve seen protectees get thirsty, get hungry, get a little woozy, sit down in a hold room. I have never seen a protectee literally faint. I don’t think there’s any reasonable person would question that she would have fell if it wasn’t for the agents. And one of the things about that video that kind of dictates to me how severe the situation was, is, if you look at that video of her getting in the van, look to the left, and you’ll see two white shirts with the NYPD. That means they’re supervisors. They’re probably lieutenants, or sergeants, meaning they probably have ten years on the job, or above. These are seasoned street cops. They see her and watch how quickly. They move right over to the vehicles. They don’t care about the Secret service, or anything. They walk right over to her. “That says to me,” Bongino concluded, “they saw something not in that camera angle, and they knew she was in a health crisis. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
