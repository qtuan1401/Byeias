 (CNN) There was a time last fall when Creed lead singer Scott Stapp claimed he was ”penniless,” had taken to living in a Holiday Inn and was convinced his family was involved in ISIS. ”I was out of my mind,” he told People magazine. Stapp now has an explanation for that period of upheaval. The singer revealed to the magazine he’s been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The events of last year were related to substance abuse and mental illness. ”I had a psychotic break that was brought on by alcohol and drug abuse,” he said. ”I was hallucinating. I drove around the United States for a month, following an angel that I saw on the hood of my car.”  In November, Stapp    best known for such Creed songs as ”With Arms Wide Open” and ”Higher”    released a video on Facebook in which he alleged that he was under ”some kind of vicious attack” because the funds in his bank accounts were stolen by people he knows or frozen by the IRS. In the video, he detailed how he had to sleep in his truck for a couple of weeks and, at one point, didn’t have enough money to eat for two days. Stapp is now in recovery, he told People, working through issues with therapy, medication and a   program. ”Nothing is more important than my sobriety,” he said.
