The FBI publicly released their findings on Hillary Clinton’s private email server, but 14 pages in the   investigative summary are redacted. [Of the 58 total pages released by the FBI, several were heavily redacted portions, including a puzzling redaction of Clinton’s date of birth.  That means over 30 percent of the report remains secret, despite the FBI’s effort at transparency.  Earlier this month, Clinton’s campaign urged the FBI to release the material to the public, after Republican lawmakers began leaking portions of the documents to the press. “If these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks,” Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign said in a statement at the time.
