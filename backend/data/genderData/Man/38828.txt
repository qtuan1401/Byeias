 (CNN) Taylor Farms announced a recall of some of its products Tuesday that contain previously recalled Sabra hummus. This is an expansion of the Sabra Dipping Co. recall announced Saturday of some hummus products and spreads because of possible listeria contamination. The products were manufactured before November 8 at a plant where listeria monocytogenes have been found, but the bacteria have not been found in products that have been tested, the FDA said. The products were distributed to retail outlets in the United States and Canada. Consumers are urged to discard any product with a ”Best Before” date through January 23, 2017. That date can be found on the lid of each package. A list of the products recalled can be found on the FDA or Sabra websites. In addition, Taylor Farms Veggie and Hummus Bistro Boxes and Schnucks Vegetable and Hummus Snack Trays are recalled because they contain   containers of Sabra Classic Hummus. These items were distributed in 23 states and the District of Columbia between October 30 and November 18.  Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, the FDA says. Symptoms of listeriosis vary but usually include fever, muscle aches, stiffness, abdominal pain and diarrhea.  No cases of illness have been reported, according to both companies.  Sabra products not included in the recall are Sabra Organic Hummus, Sabra Salsa, Sabra Guacamole and Sabra Greek Yogurt Dips. Sabra recalled 30, 000 cases of hummus in April 2015 because of fears of listeria contamination.
