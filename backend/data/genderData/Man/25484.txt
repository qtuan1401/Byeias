Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said Sunday night at the CNN debate in Michigan that, “when you are white   …     you don’t know what it’s like to be poor. ”[Sanders was answering a question about racial blind spots when he made the claim.  “When you are white, you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto, you don’t know what it’s like to be poor, you don’t know what it’s like to be hassled when you are walking down a street or dragged out of a car,” Sanders argues. “We must be firm in making it clear that we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system. ”
