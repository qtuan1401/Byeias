’  ’ ’   It’s rare for a woman to make it to the very top of a large   corporation these days, and it’s rare for an adult human to have   blond hair. ’ ’    ’ ’     Just 2 percent of the world’s population and 5 percent of white     people in the U. S. have blond hair, but 35 percent of female     U. S. senators and 48 percent of female CEOs at S&P 500     companies are blond.   ’ ’     Female university presidents are more likely to be blond, too.   ’ ’     Jennifer Berdahl and Natalya Alonso, who presented their     research at the Academy of Management’s annual meeting early     this month, say some of this blond overrepresentation can be     explained by race and age biases in leadership pipelines.   ’ ’     Blond hair is primarily found in white people, and white people     take up a disproportionate amount of space in the top tiers of     business and politics, so it makes sense that there are a     disproportionate number of blondes.   ’ ’     And children are more likely to be blond than adults, meaning     the trait signals youthfulness. But whatever blond     privilege may exist in the upper echelons of power, it doesn’t     apply to men: A study published in 2005 revealed that  of male     Fortune 500 CEOs were blond.   ’ ’     There would seem to be a paradox between the   stereotype     of the dumb blonde and this preference for blondes in     leadership positions. But  Berdahl     suggests that the two concepts aren’t so contradictory after     all —  the dumb blonde paradigm might actually explain blond     overrepresentation.   ’ ’     “Our data suggest that blonde women are not only assumed to be     younger than their darker haired counterparts, but are also     judged to be less   and less willing take a     stand than other women and than men,” she writes. “In other     words, Barbie can be CEO as long as she is young   docile,     or being blonde might allow her to be older and more forceful     than she otherwise could be. ”   ’ ’       Of course, many women —  especially those around the age of the       average CEO or senator —  dye their hair, so there are far more       people with   hair than naturally occurs. Still,       that dyed proportion wouldn’t come close to accounting for       one in three female senators or one in two female CEOs being       blonde. Berdahl  that a     population would       do more to support her conclusions than disprove them.     ’ ’  ’ ’       “If women are choosing to dye their hair blonde, there’s       something strategic about the choice,” she said. “If the       package is feminine, disarming and childlike, you can get       away with more assertive, independent and [stereotypically]       masculine behavior. ”     ’ ’       In their research, Berdahl and Alonso got 100 men to rate       photos of blond and brunette women on attractiveness,       competence, and independence.     ’ ’       The two groups of women scored equally on the first measure,       but blondes fared worse on the latter two.     ’ ’       Then, the men were shown photos of the same woman with blond       hair and brown hair.     ’ ’       The majority chose to recommend the brunette over the blonde       for a job as a CEO or senator.     ’ ’       But when the men had to rate   female       leaders —  photos of the same woman with blond or brown hair,       paired with quotes like “My staff knows who the boss is” —  they       thought the blond woman was warmer and more attractive than       her brunette twin. Berdahl’s blog calls this “. ”     ’ ’       The conclusion of these studies —  that people are better able       to stomach a female leader if they perceive her to be       gentler, less demanding, and   than her   or         peers —  aligns with earlier research on black men       in positions of power.     ’ ’       A study published in 2009 found that black male Fortune 500       CEOs were (a round face, large forehead, and smaller nose)       than their peer CEOs, while a previous study showed that       white men are lesslikely to make it to top spots in       business if they had those traits.     ’ ’       Researchers posited that people felt more comfortable with a       black man in charge if he had a “disarming,” “nonthreatening”       appearance.     ’ ’       White men seem to be the only ones who can’t look or act too       threatening for their positions of power, probably because       we’re used to seeing them there. If someone says “my staff       knows who the boss is,” I’d usually guess it’s the white guy.     ’
