Joining other Silicon Valley tech companies such as Microsoft, Google and Twitter, internet radio service Pandora has expressed their support of the Black Lives Matter movement. [Pandora tweeted from their official Twitter account saying “We stand together. #BlackLivesMatter  #LoveAboveAll” followed by an image with the following message,   “Our hearts ache for all those who unfairly lost their lives. We stand with marginalized communities. We stand for racial justice. We stand for equity. And we stand together to make this world a better place. #BlackLivesMatter #LoveAboveAll”  We stand together. #BlackLivesMatter #LoveAboveAll pic. twitter.   —   Pandora (@pandora_radio) July 9, 2016,  Users however did not all share the same sentiment as Pandora, many of them feeling that this post was particularly insensitive following the murder of 5 police officers in acts of   and   hatred.  Here are just a few of the tweets,   @pandora_radio a day after BLM killed 5 officers and wounded many more.  Very classy Pandora.  —   Space Doge (@wackiestcamper) July 9, 2016,  @pandora_radio @TheAnonnMessage shut up and play music  …    no one is paying for your political views.  —   c taylor (@TaylorCtaylor67) July 9, 2016,  @pandora_radio everybody switched to spotify,  —   Jeremy Longoria (@LongDaddy_J) July 9, 2016,  @pandora_radio and I’m deleting now,  —   Big_Blue_Nate123 (@BlueNate123) July 9, 2016,  @pandora_radio so you’ll speak out against the black on black violence and Chicago that claims many lives each week #AllLives,  —   Christopher Sosa (@chrissosa32) July 9, 2016,  Once again it seems that users don’t take kindly to tech companies pushing their political views on their userbase and further dividing their community by taking a stance on issues that do not relate to them. With companies such as Twitter adding Black Lives Matter emojis to their platform and other tech giants announcing their support of the BLM movement, it’s no surprise that a failing music service such as Pandora would attempt to jump on this particular bandwagon, but just as it did with Microsoft, it seems that this liberal pandering may backfire.
