Sex industry entrepreneur Bradley Charvet has revealed his plans to open a sex robot café in London, where visitors will be able to receive “cyber fellatio” while drinking tea. [Charvet, who is also launching a “fellatio café” in Switzerland at the end of the year, claims that the café will sell drinks, “sex, pastries  —   and nothing more” in London’s Paddington from 6am to 11pm.  “Sex robot will always be pleasing and could even become better at technique because they would be programmable to a person’s need” said Charvet in an interview with the Daily Star. “It’s totally normal to see a new way of using robots and others sex toys to have pleasure. ” “The bar is the place to meet people, to extend your network and the way to start the morning” he continued. “What could be better than meet your friends around a cafe and to enjoy a nice blowjob from a sex robot?” Charvet also claims that if the London branch is a success, he will start a café in Manchester, with the potential for a   service. He also said that each robot will be dressed in a different outfit, claiming “Uniforms are going to be worn: nurse, police, student and secretary. ” “Nothing is better to start a working day than engaging in sexual action” declared Charvet. “People like to chat before they make love. It makes sense the robots will speak and tease men’s desire. ” Prices will start from just £60 for a hot drink and a fifteen minute fellatio session, with snacks and pastries available on top.
