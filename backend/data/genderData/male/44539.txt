’  ’ ’   Uber is in crisis. ’ ’   After the stunning debut of its  last   year, CEO Travis Kalanick and his company have shifted into   serial   mode, culminating in Kalanick admitting, after    in a video   that went viral, that he needed personal and professional help. ’ ”   As a onetime avid Uber user who now almost never uses the   service, I can easily explain why Uber’s crisis was preordained.   It comes down to a simple   word. ” ’   Tipping. ’ ’   Until I was told otherwise, I assumed Uber was baking a 20% tip   into every ride. Then I learned that there were no Uber tips. ’ ’   In short order, this made me question the entire company. (For   the record, I also decided that because I mainly used Uber in New   York City, it was much easier to simply raise my hand and hail a   cab than fiddle with my phone for five minutes.) ’ ”   In New York, Uber’s antipathy to tipping may soon change. The   city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission is pressing for       services like Uber to . A vote by the TLC board could come   later this year. ” ’   Uber has opposed tipping based on the argument that eliminating   it reduces ””   about the cost of a ride. But that’’s nonsensical. A tip in a cab   is typically just math  —   usually your fare plus 20%. In the good   old days, you could be precise by taking 10% of your fare and   doubling it, or you could just give the driver a few bucks. It   was the opposite of uncertain. ’ ’  ’ ”   I lived in New York for 14 years before moving to Los Angeles for   a decade and moving back in 2014. In all my New York years, I’ve   taken countless cabs, and of late, they’ve become my main   indulgence. I suppose I have failed to tip a few times, back when   the taxi economy was   and I couldn’t tell the cabbie to   wait for me to go into my apartment to shake loose some change   from the couch cushions. ” ’   New York is a tipping town. If you don’’t want to tip, you live in   Paris. Tipping in New York is assumed for pretty much all service   industries, from cabs to bars to restaurants to moving companies.   The idea that Uber would ”disrupt” the taxi business in New York   and other   US cities but not include a tipping   feature is disturbing and tells you everything you need to know   about the company’’s values. ’ ”   I could go retro and tip my Uber driver in cash. But in New York   and in other US cities, tipping has become a frictionless   experience  —   you swipe your credit card in the cab and add a tip   at the end of your journey. You can tip the driver in cash if   that’s your thing, but the point is that tipping in a taxi in   major US cities is easy. ” ’   With Uber, tipping is a convoluted, political, and I would   suggest even a moral undertaking. For decades, those who drive   for a living have enjoyed a positive financial relationship with   their customers. Tipping was part of the bargain. The tip could   be above average, which in New York is 20% for exceptional   service. ’ ’  ’ ’   I’’m not saying taking a taxi in New York is always pleasant.   Uber’’s pitch to its many, many users has always been that its   product is superior  —   a   ”black car” service replacing   the   yellow cab. That was what initially reeled me in. ’ ”   This is what was good about Uber: Kalanick wanted to improve     with technology and a better experience. But you can   tell much about a company from its earliest expression of values,   and in Uber’s case, ditching the tipping was one of those       moves that work well for the people   being served but undermine the psychology of the workers  —   in   this case, Uber’s drivers. ” ’   The user is paramount; the customer comes first. The customs of   the drivers, be they professionals or   become   antiquated folkways, a vestige of an earlier, grubbier time, even   if in the days of assumed tipping a sort of beneficial circle of   trust had been established between drivers and passengers. ’ ”   Adding a tipping feature wouldn’t make Uber’s manifold problems   vanish. It would, however, be a step in the right direction, even   if it’s long overdue. ” ’   Every company crisis leaves a trail, one that usually leads back   to the beginning. The business world is rife with examples:   BlackBerry clinging to its keyboards in a world of proliferating   touchscreens. Railroads being outmaneuvered by automobiles and   airplanes because they were in the railroad game, not the      game.   firms pushing cheap calories   at a time when   is surging among consumers. ’ ”   Uber’s sin was to break the sacred bond between drivers and   passenger, made real by the tip. If you think about it, we’re not   talking about much money here  —   two bucks on a $10 ride. But Uber   thought tipping was onerous. And in truth, if you aren’t used to   it, tipping is sort of intimidating. ” ’   But so is New York. You get over it. Uber should have gotten over   it from the very beginning. ’ ’Uber is in crisis.
