’  ’ ’   Earlier this week,  jumped into a bull market. ’ ’   But this latest rally is based on ”shaky foundations” and will   revert soon, according to Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at   Capital Economics. ’ ’   We were here just a few months ago. ’ ’   In April, oil producers in OPEC and   nations met to try   and reach a freeze agreement on output levels, which were too   high. ’ ’   Ahead of the meeting, chatter from Russian officials and others   that suggested the meeting would end with an agreement drove   traders to buy oil futures. ’ ’’ ’   The meeting  because Saudi Arabia did not want to   enter one without Iran. ’ ’   ”The recent rally in oil prices has been primarily driven by   speculation about a possible deal between OPEC and   major   producers to freeze production,” Pugh wrote in a   note on Friday. ’ ’   West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained nearly 23% through   Thursday from the bottom in early August, when they fell below   $40 per barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose   above $50. ’ ”   It wasn’t a sudden disappearance of excess inventories that   sparked the current rally. Instead, it was the same thing that we   saw in oil markets leading up to the failed April OPEC   talks. ” ’   Some pessimism is warranted about a pact to slow down production. ’ ’   ”As a result, we think that prices will fall back over the   next few months as the outcome of next month’’s unofficial meeting   underwhelms market expectations,” Pugh wrote. ’ ’   Meanwhile in the US, oil producers have been bringing rigs back   online. This week, the  extending the     streak of this year. ’ ’   In short, crude oil is rising on hopes of talks between OPEC that   may result in a production freeze but very well may not. And the   supply imbalance in the market has not been dealt with. ’
