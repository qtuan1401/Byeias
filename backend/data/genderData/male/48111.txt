’  ’ ’   Simone Biles has done it again, winning gold at the Rio Olympics   in dominating fashion. ’ ’   Needing only to average more than 15. 253 to win gold in the   vault, Biles scored a 15. 900 on her first attempt and then did   even better on her second with a 16. 033. ’ ”   Biles’ average score of 15. 966 was 0. 713 points better than     Maria Paseka of Russia, a huge margin in the world of   gymnastics. ” ’   When Biles saw her second score and confirmation that she had won   her third gold medal, her reaction was great. She just shrugged   her shoulders. It may be hard to tell here, but her shoulders   definitely went up a bit in a shrug in the middle frame. ’ ’  ’ ’   Biles did eventually crack a smile during a high five with one of   the coaches. ’ ’  ’ ’   Biles is not done yet either. She still has two individual events   left, the beam and the floor exercise, and still has a shot to   leave Rio with five gold medals. ’
