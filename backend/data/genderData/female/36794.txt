 (CNN) The first gold medal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro has gone to an American teenager. Ginny Thrasher, a    West Virginia University sophomore, won the women’s   air rifle event on Saturday morning at the Olympic Shooting Center in Rio’s Deodoro neighborhood, edging out silver medalist Du Li of China.  Thrasher’s score of 208 set a record for a final round in an Olympics. She was one point ahead of Du Li, who won a gold medal in 2004. China’s Yi Siling took the bronze with a score of 185. 4. It’s been remarkable year of success for Thrasher, who won the NCAA’s air rifle title as a freshman in March as a member of WVU’s rifle team.
