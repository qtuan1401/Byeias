Beyoncé led her band of backup dancers to form an X in the middle of Levi’s Stadium in an apparent tribute to Malcolm X. After Beyoncé’s performance  —   which former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani called a “platform to attack police officers”  —   the hashtag #BoycottBeyoncé began trending on social media. Several Pittsburgh police officers have reportedly refused to work security for Beyoncé’s May 31 concert at Heinz Field, due to what they call the singer’s   lyrics. Many Facebook users expressed anger over Governor Dayton’s decision to honor Beyoncé, after she “promoted violence against police” and law enforcement officials.    After the  .
