Longtime aide to former president Bill Clinton Doug Band called Chelsea Clinton a “spoiled brat kid” in a heated email sent to John Podesta, saying she’s causing problems because she “has a lack of focus in her life. [Referring to Chelsea by her initials “cvc,” Band wrote in a 2011 email:  I realize it is difficult to confront and reason with her but this could go to [sic] far and then we all will have a real serious set of other problems. I don’t deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for me to explain these things. She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she’s doing because she, as she has said, hasn’t found her way and has a lack of focus in her life. Podesta replied in part advising against dragging in who sided with or against Chelsea Clinton. As reported previously by Breitbart News, Band helped the former president found the Clinton Global Initiative, which “obtained approval from the State Department for a paid consulting arrangement between Bill Clinton and Band,” one of the many examples of cronyism that occurred during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. Huma Abedin, Hillary’s extremely close aide who later separated from her husband Anthony Weiner, advised Teneo while working in Hillary’s State Department  —   while also working as a consultant for the William J. Clinton Foundation. Wikileaks released the second batch of Podesta emails Monday, the morning after the second presidential debate.
