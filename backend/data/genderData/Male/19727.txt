LAS VEGAS  —   Catherine Frazier, National Press Secretary for Ted Cruz ( )’s presidential campaign, was visibly upset on Monday when she spoke with Breitbart News in the Durango Hills YMCA. [Asked if she could comment on Communications Director Rick Tyler’s resignation, news of which broke just minutes before Cruz took the stage at a Nevada rally, she said “Not right now. I haven’t been able to follow up with the office. ”  It is unclear whether Tyler, a talented man and   political operative, will remain on board with Cruz’s team in a different capacity. Tyler was reportedly asked to resign after he published a false story about Sen. Marco Rubio ( )’s faith on Monday and was later forced to publicly apologize. Breitbart’s John Nolte reported earlier on the incident: Tyler posted a video that falsely claimed (using subtitles) Rubio told a staffer that there are “not many answers” in the Bible. The truth is that Rubio said, “all of the answers” are in the Bible. Once the truth came out Monday morning, Tyler published an apology on Facebook. Rubio didn’t let it go. The Florida Senator demanded accountability, and now Tyler is out. Cruz reportedly told reporters prior to speaking at the YMCA, “Our campaign should not have sent it. That’s why I’ve asked for Rick Tyler’s resignation. ” After Cruz spoke, a group of journalists recognized Frazier and flocked to her. In the corner of the lobby of the YMCA, two reporters could be overheard discussing that she seemed to have been crying. A Cruz staffer told Breitbart News that State director Robert Uithoven showed him a tweet and then walked away. “I don’t think Rick is with the campaign anymore,” Uithoven reportedly told him.
