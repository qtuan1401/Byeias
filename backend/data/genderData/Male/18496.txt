During the question and answer portion of a town hall event Wednesday in Minnesota, Chelsea Clinton referred to Hillary’s Democratic rival as “President Sanders. ”[Chelsea was addressing Bernie Sanders’ vote for “prosecutorial immunity to gun manufacturers” when the Freudian slip occurred.   This isn’t the first time Chelsea Clinton has felt the “Bern,” if you will. Chelsea Clinton claimed, on January 12, that Bernie Sanders’ health care plan would “empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid” and undo Obamacare. That line of attack was deemed “mostly false” by the     at Politifact. The Clinton healthcare attack on Sanders last month also turned into a huge money maker for the Sanders campaign. “As of now, we are at about $1. 4 million raised since yesterday when the panic attacks by the Clinton campaign began,” Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said, according to the Washington Post. “We’ve gotten 47, 000 contributions. We’re projecting 60, 000 donations. Even for our   campaign, this is pretty darn impressive. ” Bernie Sanders is nearly tied with Hillary Clinton in the latest national polls. The socialist senator from Vermont also has a commanding   point lead over Clinton, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
