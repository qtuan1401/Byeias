’  ’ ”     Pity America’s gas station owners. They may not be with us for     much longer.   ” ’     Yes, despite the recent spike in the price of oil, gas still     remains historically cheap. And Americans are  and they are  ’ ’     But gas stations have been in decline for decades. Between 1994     and 2013, the number of retail fueling sites in the U. S. fell     from 202, 800 to   25 percent decline. In 2015, the     number had slipped to about 150, 000. (See page 31 of from the National     Association of Convenience Stores.) And with several powerful     megatrends arrayed against them, there are signs that their     numbers could shrink significantly in coming years.   ’ ”     Let’s start with gentrification. (And this is the good news.)     In many urban areas, gas station owners are finding it simply     doesn’t make economic sense to keep selling       reasons having nothing to do with demand for their product. As     America’s great cities revitalize and attract more wealth, land     is becoming exceedingly expensive. In many cities, and     especially in New York, a gas station falls far down on the     list of the best things to do with a piece of land.   ” ’     Owners realize they can run their businesses at modest profits     for years to come or sell out to developers for giant premiums.     In Manhattan, where the best use for a  the number of gas     stations fell by a third between 2004 and   just 39. As     the New York Times reports, ”Today there is not a     single operating gas station left on the city’’s East Side from     the southern tip of the island to 23rd St.” The     conversion of gas stations into apartments and offices is also     starting to happen in other   cities such as     ; ; and especially      where at     least   gas stations have made way for other     developments over the past six years.   ’ ’  ’ ”       Several other trends are afoot that will lessen the       underlying demand for gas stations’ core product. Gasoline,       which was pretty much the only transportation fuel for       vehicles until very recently, is slowly being displaced by a       couple of sources, neither of which relies on gas stations to       deliver them.     ” ”       First, there’s natural gas. Cheap and abundant thanks to       fracking, compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas       are emerging as   so much for consumers and       individual cars but for fleets. One of my favorite sites,        documents how operators of huge       delivery fleets such as  or giant armadas of       garbage trucks such as  are       systematically switching their fleets to run on natural         fuels instead of gasoline.     ” ’       NGT News is also filled with news of the new infrastructure       springing up to service all these fleets. According to the       Energy Department,  in the U. S. And there are hundreds more on the       way.  Cities and municipalities are       building their own stations to fuel .     ’ ’  ’ ”       The other force is electricity, of course. The penetration of       electric cars in America’s fleet is still very low. But every       month, several thousand new cars hit the           don’t use any gasoline at all and will never,       ever, ever stop at gas stations (unless their drivers need to       make a pit stop for a Fresca or beef jerky).     ” ’       Sales of   cars are running at about 6, 500 month,       according to . But there are signs       of greater electrification. About 6, 000   hybrids,        are sold every       month. And there are many, many more to come. Tesla has       already taken .     ’ ”       Off in the distance, the prospect of   and       autonomous cars also poses a threat. Driverless cars may take       much longer than people think to develop into a real thing,       because of issues surrounding licensing, insurance,  and infrastructure. But it’s       not too   to imagine that a decade from now,       people, rather than owning cars, might subscribe to some sort       of mobility service that runs fleets of autonomous vehicles.       Will those cars refuel at the local Sunoco? Or will they go       back to base at night where their owners will gas them up?     ” ’       And if you want to really look to the future, look no further       than Norway. The     deployed some of the       wealth from its vast North Sea oil resource into generous       incentives for electric cars,  Now come reports that       several political parties may propose  would forbid       the sales of cars that run on gasoline by 2025.     ’ ’  ’ ”         Gas stations won’t greet all of these developments lying         down, of course. Many of them occupy locations that will         enable them to continue fulfilling their fueling function.         The gas stations on Connecticut’s Merritt Parkway, for         example, have already been fitted out with Tesla charging         stations. Some convenience stores are  CNG pumps to         their array of gasoline pumps. We’ll likely see much more         of this.       ” ’         But these are expensive efforts for   businesses         to undertake. Future government   prospect of the         Environmental Protection Agency enforcing the new           limits or offering new incentives for         alternative fuel   likely help push greater         consolidation and contraction in the industry. Ten years         from now, gas stations may be pushed out of central cities         and concentrated near highway  . Players such as         Walmart and Costco, which already sell gas on very low         margins, will gain market share.       ’ ’         Like those other fixtures of our           downtowns and main   neighborhood soda fountain,         bookstore, and     local gas station         may be fading into memory in the 21st century.        ’ ’Pity America’s gas station owners.
