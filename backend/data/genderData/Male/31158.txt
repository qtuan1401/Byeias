  protesters gathered outside the British Parliament in London Wednesday calling for Article 50 to be triggered as soon as possible. [Activists were addressed by politicians such as Conservative MPs Jacob   and David Davies, and UKIP politicians including leadership candidate John   and London Assembly member David Kurten, to mark five months since the vote to leave the European Union.  The protest came as MPs look set to vote on whether to trigger Article 50 following a court ruling that the government must consult parliament. Hundreds of activists waved flags and held placards saying “Keep calm and accept our vote” and “Theresa May don’t delay. We want Brexit right away”. David Davies MP addressed the crowd, saying: “I was proud to fight with people of all races and all religions and all political backgrounds for Brexit and I love all the people of this great country of ours”. Meanwhile UKIP London Assembly Member David Kurten said: “We want our laws made in Westminster, not in Brussels”. Conservative MP Jacob   said it was a “great time to be British”. “The future of our country is fantastic and will lead to a golden economic age,” he added.
