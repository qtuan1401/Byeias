TheRichest, a popular YouTube “vidbait” channel, compared Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos to paedophiles, rapists, attempted murderers, and even ISIS, including him in a list of “evil people who should be banned from the Internet. ”[Channels such as TheRichest produce videos such as “10 Things Most People Can’t Do With Their Body” and “Top 10 Terrible And Sometimes DANGEROUS Internet Crazes,” enticing people to watch the video with their   headlines and preview images.   In the video, TheRichest proclaims that Milo was banned from Twitter for “targeting Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones  …     [with] bullying and hurtful tweets” that “encouraged” his followers to “harass” her. However, not only has Milo condemned the abuse of Jones, but in fact, Twitter users were already targeting Jones before Milo directed any tweet at her. The claim in the video that Milo broke Twitter’s rule of “targeted harassment” was therefore false ironically, Jones has committed that same infraction, declaring that she “blows anyone up” on Twitter who tweeted something mean at her.
