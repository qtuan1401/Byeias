During a heated exchange on immigration policy at the GOP Debate on Saturday night in South Carolina, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) blasted rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) for not speaking Spanish. Both men are of Cuban descent. [“Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama’s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office,” Cruz said.  Rubio retorted: “First of all, I don’t know how he knows what I said on Univision, ’cause he doesn’t speak Spanish. ” (Cruz responded in Spanish, challenging Rubio to continue in that language “if you want. ”) As to the facts, Rubio made the remarks nearly a year ago, as Breitbart News reported at the time, telling Jorge Ramos in Spanish that Obama’s executive action to defer deportation for illegal aliens who arrived in the U. S. as children “can’t be terminated from one moment to the next, because there are already people benefiting from it. ”
