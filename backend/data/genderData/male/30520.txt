Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos is joining Snapchat, the fastest growing social media platform, with over 200 million monthly active users, sending on average 400 million snaps per day. [If you’ve missed Milo’s snappy, fabulous witticisms on Twitter, then you can follow him on the   site by scanning the Snapcode above, or searching for his username on the platform: “Yiannopoulos. ”  For those who do not fall into the usual demographic of Snapchat, users can send each other pictures or videos which then disappear after being viewed. This unique feature may be why it is the most popular social network for teens today. Although Snapchat does have the reputation of being a sexting hub, it is probably not advisable to send Milo lewd images, unless you are of a very particular ethnicity.
