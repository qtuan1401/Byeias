’  ’ ’   So you braved a   journey to Mars, hurtling through space   aboard a cramped spaceship. ’ ”   As you set up camp on the Red Planet, boldly stepping where no   earthling has stepped before, you find yourself asking that age   old question: What’s for dinner? ” ”   Lots of veggies, it turns out. At least, that’s the plan. ” ”   On Thursday, researchers from Wageningen University in the   Netherlands announced that vegetables and cereals they spent two   years growing in ’Martian’ soil were found to be safe for human   munching. ” ’   Although the soil was not actually scooped off the   surface of Mars, scientists made sure to use terrestrial soil   that mimics what we would find on the Red Planet. ”Abundant   harvests of radishes, peas, rye and tomatoes” grown in this soil   were found to contain ”no dangerous levels” of heavy metals,   . ’ ’’ ’   Taste tests, starting with the radishes, will begin on June 29,   . ’ ’   ”These remarkable results are very promising,” Wieger Wamelin,   senior ecologist, said to Phys. org. ”We can actually eat the   radishes, peas, rye and tomatoes, and I am very curious what they   will taste like.” ’ ’   The researchers are also growing other crops, such as potatoes,   green beans, and carrots. And a crowdfunding campaign is backing   research to figure out if these crops are also safe to eat. ’ ’   SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has announced plans to send humans to Mars   by 2025, and NASA has said that we could see manned missions to   Mars within the next 10 to 15 years. ’ ’   And with any hope, this new research will make these trips as   nutritious (and delicious) as possible. ’ ’   ”It’’s important to test as many crops as possible, to make sure   that settlers on Mars have access to a broad variety of different   food sources,” Wamelin said. ’ ’So you braved a   journey to Mars. ..’
