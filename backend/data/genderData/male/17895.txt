From Michael Goodwin writing at the New York Post:  As the Brexit results poured in, I caught myself humming a tune from Broadway’s “Hamilton. ” The song follows the decisive Battle of Yorktown in 1781, after which the Redcoats surrender and America is free. It’s called a drinking song, and there’s not much to it except these words: “The world turned upside down. ” It certainly has. The world is also coming full circle because now it’s the Brits who are free. It took them a while, but they finally had their own Tea Party and their own revolution. I salute them for their courage. And I raise a glass to freedom (that’s “Hamilton,” too). Revolutions are a leap into the unknown and require the right mix of outrage, determination and leadership. They are testament to the ethos of an entire country and culture when they succeed without a shot being fired. That’s the beauty of Brexit, and of grand old England. The people spoke, they were heard, and the wheel of history is turning. Let’s get on with it.

Naturally, the establishment media lectured the rubes on what was good for them. Sound familiar, America? Read the rest of the story at the New York Post.
