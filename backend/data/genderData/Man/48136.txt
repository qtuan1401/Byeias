’  ’ ’   Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced on Tuesday   that she is stepping down,  following her conviction in a perjury   trial. ’ ’   ”I have been honored to serve the people of Pennsylvania and I   wish them health and safety in all their days,” Kane said in a   statement. ’ ’   Kane was  on Monday in a jury trial in   which she faced two counts of perjury and 10 misdemeanor counts   of abusing the powers of her office. ’ ’   In a separate statement, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said   ”[Kane’’s] decision to resign is the right one, and will allow the   people of Pennsylvania to finally move on from this situation.” ’ ’   The trial centered on a scandal in which Kane allegedly gave   sealed grand jury documents to the press with the intent of   damaging her political rival and former state prosecutor, Frank   Fina. ’ ”   Kane and Fina’s longstanding feud raged on both sides, sometimes   manifesting in attempts to subvert one another. ” ’  ’ ’   Separately, Kane was embroiled in a   of the Jerry   Sandusky molestation case after she claimed to have found   inappropriate emails exchanged between officials involved in the   matter. ’ ’   Kane alleged the charges in her perjury trial were levied to   prevent scandalous findings surrounding that case from being   released, Reuters noted. ’ ”   Bruce Castor, Kane’s deputy, will take over as acting attorney   general. ” ’   Kane could face up to seven years in prison. She is scheduled to   be sentenced Oct. 24. ’
