Bloomberg’s John Heilemann said Saturday on MSNBC that people backing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton “shoot blanks” when asked why Clinton is better than fellow candidate Bernie Sanders.  “I asked Congressman [Jim] Clyburn yesterday. I said, ‘Look, explain to me on policy why Hillary Clinton is better for the   community than Bernie Sanders,’” Heilemann stated. “On policy, on what they will do. And they always kind of shoot blanks on that question. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
