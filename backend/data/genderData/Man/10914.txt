THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP)  —   An asylum seeker in the Netherlands has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for raping a    woman after attempting to strangle and drown her. [The rape in September led one local mayor to suggest a curfew for residents of a local  ’ center. Bort Koelewijn, mayor of the northeastern town of Kampen, told a local television station last month that such a restriction should be considered to prevent similar attacks in the future.  The    rapist was not identified Thursday, in line with Dutch privacy guidelines. Prosecutors said in a statement last month that he lived in an  ’ center. Dutch media reported that he was originally from Eritrea.
