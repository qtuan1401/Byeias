Immigrants are assimilating to American society at a much slower rate than in prior decades, says a   report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. [The evidence shows a “slowing rate of wage convergence for immigrants admitted after 1979,” said the report, titled “The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration. ”  For example, immigrants, legal and illegal, who arrived between 1965 and 1969 halved the wage gap with   Americans from  . 25 to  . 120 in 10 years and effectively eliminated the gap by after 20 years, the report says.  In contrast, the immigrants who arrived between 1995 and 1999 have barely made any progress in closing the average   with   Americans, the report shows in Table  .  When education is factored in, the 1990s immigrants have halved the wage cap in 10 years, while the 1960s immigrants reduced their wage gap by down to   in 10 years.  The reality may be even worse than is shown by the earnings data because a large number of   migrants eventually return home, so removing  themselves from the data, the report says.  Part of the economic problem is that migrants aren’t learning English as fast as their predecessors.  “The general result holds that immigrants who arrived during the late 1980s and 1990s are slower in accumulating language skills than those who arrived in the late 1970s,” the report says.
