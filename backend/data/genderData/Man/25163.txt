Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) refused to say his running mate Hillary Clinton lied to the public about her email scandal while promising absolute transparency.  On concerns of Hillary’s trustworthiness, Kaine said, “I’m not assuming that’s going to be the case even a month from now. I think we came out of the convention with a real positive momentum. The convention, as you know, started off with some churn on the Democratic side on Monday. But by Thursday night, we were together and pulling the same direction’” When  asked if Clinton lied to the American public Kaine continued, “Chuck let me just say this, I’m going to jump to the punch line. I heard Hillary Clinton say over and over again when I sit next to her and watch her on TV that with respect to the   I made a mistake and I’ve learned something and I wouldn’t do it again and I’ve heard her apologize. I did hear that back and forth and I think Chris Wallace and Hillary were sort of talking past each other last week. She was saying what Director Comey acknowledged to be true, when she spoke to the FBI, the FBI thought her answers in that setting were truthful. Chris might have been asking her a different question, but the bottom line is this, she made a mistake and she said over and over again I made a mistake and I’ve learned from it and I’m going to fix it and I apologize for it. ” He added. “I know that this is something that she’s learned from and we’re going to be real transparent, absolutely. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
