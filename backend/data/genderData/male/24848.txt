A man identified by the Toronto police as the culprit who threw a beer at Baltimore outfielder Hyun Soo Kim during Tuesday night’s American League   game turned himself in on Thursday and has been charged with mischief. [Ken Pagan, an employee for Postmedia, contacted the cops on Wednesday evening and showed up at the police station on Thursday morning after an   surveillance video allegedly exposed Pagan as the alleged beer can thrower.   ESPN reported that although the police “are confident” they positively identified the    copy editor as the suspect, Pagan hinted that the police may be wrong when he told the Toronto Sun, which is owned by Postmedia, that he drinks beer “out of a cup. ” Ironically, Pagan’s employer had offered a $1, 000 reward to catch the   culprit.
