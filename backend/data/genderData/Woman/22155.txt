President Obama blamed male lawmakers for sales taxes on tampons and pads for women, suggesting that they were ignorant of the struggles of women in America. [Obama hosted a series of interviews with YouTube personalities this afternoon, including one interview with Ingrid Nilsen, a woman who asked why tampons and pads for women were frequently taxed as a “luxury goods” in nearly 40 states.  “I don’t know anyone who has a period that thinks it’s a luxury,” Nilsen said. “It’s something that’s part of our everyday lives and is really crucial to our health as women. ” Obama chuckled. “I think that’s fair to say  —   Michelle would agree with you on that,” he said. Obama said he had “no idea” why states would tax menstrual products. “I suspect that it’s because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed. ” he added. Obama said that the taxes weren’t federal, and that women would have to organize in those states to get those extra taxes repealed.
