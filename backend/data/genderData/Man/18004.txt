On the Friday broadcast of ESPN2’s “First Take,”   Stephen A. Smith accused the media of “literally trying to win the election for Hillary [Clinton]. ”  Fellow   Max Kellerman disputed Smith’s statement, calling it “outrageously opposite” of the fact. “You can say it’s outrageous all you want to. I thought that the way the coverage was going on, it was incredibly favorable to Hillary. Now, I’m on the record. I voted for Hillary,” Smith responded. Kellerman interrupted, saying that was “insane. ” Smith continued, “OK, that’s fine. You’ve got your opinion and I have mine. I thought it was   in terms of the coverage, and I watched it every night. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
