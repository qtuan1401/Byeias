Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign raised $20 million in January, according to a press release. [From BernieSanders. com:  CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa  —   More than $20 million  —   almost all from online contributions averaging about $27 apiece  —   was donated to Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in January during the   to Monday’s Iowa caucuses. In another powerful demonstration of Sanders’ growing grassroots backing, the more than 770, 000 individual contributions in January pushed the total number of donations for his entire campaign past the 3. 25 million mark. That’s a record at this point in the campaign for any White House candidate. Unlike other campaigns which rely heavily on wealthy donors who give the maximum allowed by law, more than 99. 9 percent of Sanders’ donors can give again. In sharp contrast, Federal Election Commission reports indicate that more than 3 in 5 dollars given to Hillary Clinton come from donors who already have given her the maximum allowed by law. “The numbers we’ve seen since Jan. 1 put our campaign on pace to beat Secretary Clinton’s goal of $50 million in the first quarter of 2016,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager. “Working Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled. ” While the Sanders campaign is supported by millions of   contributions, Clinton left the campaign trail in Iowa one day last week to hold a fundraiser in Philadelphia sponsored by leading executives of a large investment firm. It’s not yet known how much she added at that event to her reported $17 million in campaign contributions over the years from Wall Street and financial services interests.
