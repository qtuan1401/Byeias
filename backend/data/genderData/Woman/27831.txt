A PBS moderator at Thursday night’s Democratic debate in Milwaukee was apparently caught on a live mic sighing, “Oh, God,” as Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) began an answer on foreign policy by referring to the Vietnam War. [Gawker has the catch —  though it is not clear which   moderator is speaking.  Sanders had seized on Hillary Clinton’s relationship with Henry Kissinger, the statesman who served as President Richard Nixon’s Secretary of State. Though Kissinger negotiated the end of the Vietnam War —  an achievement for which he later received a Nobel Peace Prize —  he also has been accused of helping Nixon of secretly expanding the war into Cambodia. The left has long regarded Kissinger as a kind of war criminal. A year ago, as Kissinger appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to testify about the Iran deal, activists from Code Pink tried to arrest him, prompting Sen. John McCain ( ) to expel them from the room, adding: “Get out of here, you   scum. ” One moderator at the Democratic debate, Judy Woodruff, has donated to the Clinton Foundation.
