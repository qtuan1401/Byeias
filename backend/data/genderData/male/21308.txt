A woman who suspected her husband of cheating on her with their maid found evidence to prove her hunch when her pet parrot started squawking saucy lines that she knew hadn’t been said to her. [The woman took the parrot to police to expose her husband for his affair, which is illegal in Kuwait where they lived, the Daily Mail reported.  She filed an adultery complaint with police, but authorities ruled that the parrot couldn’t be used as evidence because it was impossible to determine where the parrot had heard it. They argued the parrot could have spouted those lines from a television or radio show. In Kuwait, which is a Muslim country, adultery is illegal and people found guilty of it are sentenced to severe punishment.
