As nations honored their war veterans on Friday  —   Armistice Day and Veterans Day  —  a    in California is trying to preserve as many voices of World War II veterans in the United States as he can. Many of the veterans are in their twilight years, with ages in the late 80s and the 90s. The teenager, Rishi Sharma, has started a nonprofit organization, Heroes of the Second World War, to record video interviews with them for posterity. Of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II, about 620, 000 are still alive, and 372 die each day, according to the National World War II Museum. The teenager, who graduated last year from Agoura High School outside Los Angeles, wrote on a crowdfunding page that there is “no commercial aspect” to the project. He said he’s putting off many of the typical priorities of    like going to college, finding a job or dating, so that he can focus on the project. “These men are my biggest heroes and my closest friends,” Mr. Sharma wrote. “I am just trying to get a better understanding of what they had to go through in order for me and so many others to be here today and to get a better appreciation for how good I have it. ” Mr. Sharma received an influx of donations on Friday as the United States commemorated Veterans Day. Across the country, Americans  —   including President Obama, who laid a wreath in Arlington Cemetery in Washington  —   led tributes to past and present military members. Several countries also honored their veterans on Armistice Day, commemorating the end of World War I, with two minutes of silence on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.
