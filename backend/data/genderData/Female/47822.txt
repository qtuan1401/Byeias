But prosecutors say   the attack does not appear to be explicitly political in   motivation. ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ”   Sonboly, who was not previously known to police, apparently   suffered from depression and was, at one point, in psychiatric   care for two months. A    who went to Sonboly’s   high school told The New York Times’ Rukmini Callimachi that   Sonboly had been severely bullied at school. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Sonboly had evidently researched previous killing sprees,   . A book entitled ”Rampage in Head: Why   Students Kill,” was found during searches of the home he shared   with his parents in  ’ ’  ’ ’   Sonboly’’s parents are ”too shocked to help with the   investigation” at this time, police said. ’ ’   Police also  ’ ”   He apparently lured victims to the McDonald’s where he opened   fire after setting up a fake Facebook page under a woman’s   name ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Three    and two    are among those who were   killed. The other victims were 17, 19, 21 and 45 years old,   police said. The victims did not appear to be intentionally   chosen, investigators said Sunday. ’ ’   German prosecutors say the number of people injured in   the shooting has risen to 35. Ten are seriously injured. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
