Columnist Pat Buchanan argued the State of the Union was more of a reflection of “the state of Barack Obama’s mind” and that Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) contradicts the president’s rhetoric on the economy on Friday’s “McLaughlin Group. ”  Buchanan said, “It was a good speech as a speech, John, but it stated less the state of the union than the state of Barack Obama’s mind. He’s very positive on where the economy is going. Bernie Sanders is out on the hustings saying, you know, the middle class is going under, the rich are getting everything. And then, Obama says, you know, look, this isn’t like the Cold War, the Cuban missile crisis, all the nuclear weapons threaten us  —   bunch of guys in pickup trucks. What did we find? You got explosions in Jakarta, explosions in Paris, explosions in San Bernardino. Everybody tremendously concerned about ISIS, which is a cancer that is metastasizing. Now, it’s not the Cuban missile crisis, but it is deadly serious. And quite frankly, two thirds of the country  —     of the country, excuse me, think the nation is going in the wrong direction, John. And that was not the mood, or that was not the tenor of the president’s address. So, what I say is, it reflected more the mind of Barack Obama than it did the State of the Union, as the American people see it. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
