A video shows a prepubescent girl, covered in a niqab, decapitating a baby toy doll while singing an Islamist hymn. [According to Heavy, the video, titled “So wird die neue Generation aufgezogen” or “The new generation is raised,” was released by an Islamic State (ISIS) sympathizer on a German terrorist Telegram channel.   Memri TV captioned the film, which shows the little girl chanting, “State of Islam, attack and defeat the religion of heresy and the gang of the military. Instill terror, exterminate the leftover remnants (of the army) and slaughter. Soon, soon you shall witness wonders. A fearsome struggle you shall see. ” Just before she decapitates the toy doll, she threatens “kafirs” and   with violence. The child then takes the knife to the doll on the floor and severs its head, picks it up off the floor, and then drops it back to the ground. The Islamic State theme song plays in the background. The child then lifts its fists in the air and shouts, “Allahu Akbar. ” The Islamic State has used several mechanisms to recruit and train child soldiers, including forcing children to play soccer with decapitated heads as a way to desensitize them to violence. It has also forced child soldiers to replace adults who have been killed in the battlefield or who have deserted the Islamic militant terrorist group. According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) the Islamic State had recruited more than 400 children between January and March of 2015. Currently, thousands of child soldiers are likely being indoctrinated for the group’s cause. Many of them are living under territories the Islamic State has captured.
