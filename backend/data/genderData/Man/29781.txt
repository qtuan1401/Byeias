[Klein was speaking during his weekly segment on John Batchelor’s popular national radio show.  Click below to listen to the full interview.  “Iran is on the march and there are many moving parts here,” explained Klein.  “The tectonic plates have shifted here in the Middle East  …    and the question is where is the United States?” Klein continued, speaking to Batchelor: “So because the United States is nowhere, because the president of the United State did almost nothing when Iran   a ballistic missile in October, total violation of a Security Council resolution. Multiple   exercises in the Strait of Hormuz a few weeks ago. The U. S. did nothing. So the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, backed up by Ayatollah Khomeini, of course, they understand that they can stage this provocation. ” In a Breitbart Jerusalem analysis piece on Wednesday, Klein viewed Iran’s capture and subsequent release of ten American sailors as a “deliberately generated crisis” by the country’s Islamic hardliners “for pure domestic consumption with the aim of ensuring the ayatollahs’s continued grip on power. ” “Of course, the latest events must also be seen through the lens of the wider   divide,” added Klein, “and the need for the Iranians to regain the narrative and upstage the Saudi axis after the Kingdom’s provocative killing earlier this month of the prominent Shiite cleric Nimr Baqir  . ” “It is stunning that the Iranians believe they can get away with these provocations while they use the Obama administration as willing dupes for their internal   propaganda efforts. ”
