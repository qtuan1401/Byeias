Coincidence or crafty marketing? [Paramount Pictures released the latest teaser trailer for its upcoming Brad   Cotillard romantic drama Allied on Tuesday  —   just as news had broken that Pitt and wife Angelina Jolie were divorcing, and that Cotillard may have had something to do with it.   The New York Post‘s Page Six reported Tuesday that “the final straw” in Pitt and Jolie’s marriage came when the actress and UN special envoy hired a private investigator to tail Pitt on the set of Allied because she suspected him of cheating with Cotillard. The report alleges Pitt was, in fact, cheating with the French actress, although multiple reports and sources have since said the claim is untrue. Either way, the trailer’s release generated a ton of buzz on social media, most likely due to its impeccably coincidental timing. Could it possibly be a publicity stunt to promote #Allied with this whole brangelina divorce? !?
