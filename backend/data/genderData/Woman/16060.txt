Hillary Clinton’s latest book is off to a pitiful start  —   selling a paltry 2, 912 copies in its first week of release, a report shows. [Clinton’s new release, Stronger Together, which unveiled her vision for America should she become president, is “what the publishing industry would consider a flop,” according to The New York Times.  The Democrat nominee’s blueprint for America’s future is selling even worse than her last book, her 2015 memoir Hard Choices, which at least racked up 85, 000 sales in its first week. The Times notes that   sales often amount to as much as one third of total sales  —   which means Stronger Together‘s total sales figures may not ever equal Hard Choice‘s first week. By July of 2014, Hillary’s Hard Choices had only sold 181, 000 copies  —   which hardly justified the $14 million advance that publisher Simon  Schuster gave her. By contrast, Sarah Palin’s 2009 book, Going Rogue, sold 469, 000 copies in its first week. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.
