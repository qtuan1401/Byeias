Court documents reveal that a Minnesota Muslim who was allegedly plotting with others to join the Islamic State discussed routing potential terrorists through Mexico to carry out attacks on U. S. soil.  Gules Ali Omar reportedly told members of ISIS that a route through Mexico into the United States could be used to smuggle in potential terrorists according to documents obtained by Breitbart Texas that were filed by prosecutors earlier this week. Omar was alleged to have been conspiring with a group of Muslim men to join the fight with ISIS to carry out attacks against this country. Prosecutors said in the documents that Omar spoke of how one of the defendants “found a means of reaching Syria by going through Mexico. ” He then allegedly said that “defendants will be able to tell ISIL of the route so that ISIL can send fighters into the United States via that route to mount attacks. ” The documents were filed by prosecutors arguing why their evidence should be admitted in a trial scheduled to begin in May against Omar and some of his alleged conspirators. Omar is set to stand trial along with Hamza Naj Ahmed, Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, and Abdirahman Yasin Daud.
