NEW YORK (AP)  —   CBS says media mogul Sumner Redstone has resigned as chair of the company’s board, replaced by the company’s CEO, Leslie Moonves. [The company says Redstone’s resignation took effect Tuesday and he now serves as chairman emeritus.  He remains the executive chairman of Viacom. The   ’s health and mental capacity have been at the center of a   court fight. Redstone’s   and longtime companion Manuela Herzer has raised issues about his   capacity after she was expelled from his house in October. Herzer was previously in control of Redstone’s care until their split. She contends that Redstone is unable to speak and cannot meaningfully engage in   about his medical care or other topics.
