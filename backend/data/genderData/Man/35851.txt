 (CNN) Will all your favorites make it out alive?  Sunday night marks the season six finale of ”Game of Thrones.” The series is, notoriously, one of television’s bloodiest shows. No characters are safe from being killed off.  At 70 minutes, ”The Winds of Winter” will be the show’s longest episode ever. Since the series has advanced beyond the ”A Song of Ice and Fire” book series by George R. R. Martin, it’s unclear to all fans what may happen. At the end of the last episode, some favorite ”Game of Thrones” characters were in unusual spots: Standing still. Arya Stark had declared to her erstwhile mentor in all things   in Essos that she was going home to Westeros. Jon Snow and his   Sansa Stark have retaken Winterfell, their ancestral home    and are mourning their youngest brother Rickon. And where is their other brother, Bran? Fan favorite Daenerys Targaryen rescued her adopted city, Meereen, from slavers, and has made a pact with Yara Greyjoy, who wants nothing more than to rule her own homeland, the Iron Isles.  The   Khaleesi controls three dragons, the ultimate weapon in   warfare, so her primary adviser, the Westerosi lush Tyrion Lannister, no doubt has big plans.
