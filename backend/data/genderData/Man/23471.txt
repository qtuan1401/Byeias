The Boston Herald is endorsing New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the Republican presidential primary, arguing that he is the best choice among Republicans to lead the country. [“Starting now this race gets serious, and Christie is a serious candidate,” the editorial from the Herald reads, citing the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino.  The paper is widely read in New Hampshire and Christie’s second major newspaper endorsement in the region. He also earned the endorsement of the New Hampshire Union Leader. Governor John Kasich earned the endorsement from the Boston Globe. So Senators Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz failed to earn any endorsements from the major newspapers trusted by New Hampshire voters. The Herald spoke favorably of Christie’s personality, suggesting it would be good for voters who were angry about the direction of the country. “There is just something about that Jersey guy attitude  —   feisty but not   tough but not hateful  —   that has a shot at taking an angry electorate and helping it find a focus and a purpose,” the paper wrote.
