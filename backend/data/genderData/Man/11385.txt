Google has joined the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that sets specific standards in order to improve ads for consumers.

Once website owners have removed the offending ads, they are eligible to   their website for review which should prevent them being blacklisted by Google in teh future. Google has suggested that website publisher review the new best practices guide to ensure that their website runs smoothly.
