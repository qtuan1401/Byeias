A Texas teacher’s “no homework” policy is going viral after introducing a   approach to homework. [Samantha Gallagher posted on Facebook an image of the note that her daughter’s teacher sent to the class about the class homework policy.   “After much research this summer, I am trying something new. Homework will only consist of work that your student did not finish during the school day. There will be no formally assigned homework this year,” Ms. Brandy Young said in the note. Young also included a little bit of advice for parents on what to do with their children instead of homework. “Research has been unable to prove that homework improves students performances. Rather, I ask that you spend your evenings doing things that are proven to correlate with student success. Eat dinner as a family, read together, play outside, and get your child to bed early,” Young wrote. Gallagher’s caption on the photo said, “Brooke is loving her new teacher already!” The post has gone viral on Reddit and has been shared over 60, 000 times on Facebook. Gallagher said in a Facebook comment that people have contacted her from countries such as Australia, Japan, Ireland and Africa and that she is keeping up with feedback as it comes in.
