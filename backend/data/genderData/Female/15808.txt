President Barack Obama’s deputies will insert a rule in federal regulations on Friday to prevent federal facilities from operating   bathrooms. [The rule in the “Federal Register” of regulations will open up thousands of bathrooms in federally operated buildings to employees and visitors who claim on any given day to be “transgender” members of the opposite sex.  BuzzFeed reports it obtained a draft notice of the rule that was sent to federal agencies. According to the report: In addition to the estimated 1 million federal civilian workers employed in those spaces, GSA spokesperson Ashley   told BuzzFeed News, the rule will cover anyone who enters the facilities  —   from people visiting courthouses to those stopping in at Social Security offices. “This includes all kinds of Americans,”   said. “We wanted to make clear that a person can use facilities that match their gender identity, and we think that’s a good thing. ” Chai Feldblum, a progressive member of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said the rule is of “great significance,” adding, “This type of requirement can change the default for what life is like for those federal employees and people who enter federal buildings. ” The rule states, “Federal agencies occupying space under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA must allow individuals to use restroom facilities and related areas consistent with their gender identity. ” The Obama administration has made bathroom use a focus of its latest drive to upend   societal norms that men and women are different. Dismissing concerns for the safety and comfort of women and children, the Obama administration has used the same tactic of declaring their political goal to be a human rights obligation, just as militant LGBT lobbyists promoted   marriage as a legal right. In the wake of a new North Carolina law that protects the privacy and safety of women and children in public rest rooms, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a lawsuit against the state, alleging the law violates the civil rights of gay and transgender individuals to use the bathrooms of their choice. Additionally, in May, the Obama administration issued a directive that all public schools must allow   students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms according to their preferred “gender identity” at any given time. As is often the case with Obama administration decrees, they are backed by threats to cut federal funding designated for school districts that oppose the policy. One coalition of states  —   led by Texas  —   filed a federal lawsuit that argues the Obama administration has wrongly redefined “sex” to also include “gender identity. ” Another group of states filed a similar lawsuit against the administration over the new bathroom directive. Similarly, a group of Illinois parents filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration after its school district opened up its bathrooms to   students without any notice to parents. According to one study of the 2010 census, that population of transgender people amounts to 1 in every 2, 400 Americans, or 0. 03 percent of the adult population. Multiple polls show that Obama’s transgender policy is very unpopular.
