[Sallis’ talent agency, Jonathan Altaras Associates, said he died Friday at a retirement home for actors in London.  Born in London in 1921, Sallis began his working life in a bank, but caught the acting bug as a Royal Air Force serviceman during World War II. After the war, he attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and built up a diverse career onstage and in British film and television. He became famous in Britain as a star of the   sitcom “Last of the Summer Wine. ” Sallis was proud to have appeared in every episode during the show’s   run. Millions around the world know his voice from animator Nick Park’s “Wallace and Gromit,” which charted the adventures of a   Yorkshireman with a passion for inventing wild contraptions and his   silent dog, Gromit. With their     animation and lightly anarchic British humor, Park’s short films, feature and BBC series gained fans around the world. Two of the films, “The Wrong Trousers” and “A Close Shave” won Academy Awards. The bald,   character Sallis voiced between 1989 and 2010 was instantly recognizable from his    Yorkshire accent and frequent exclamation of “Cheese, Gromit!” Park said Sallis “was always my first and only choice for Wallace. ” “He brought his unique gift and humor to all that he did, and encapsulated the very British art of the droll and understated,” he said.
