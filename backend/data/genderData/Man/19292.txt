National Journal Senior Political Columnist Ron Fournier argued that Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is “still meandering all over the place” and a debate moderator should ask about Clinton’s emails and the State Department IG’s subpoena of the Clinton Foundation’s records “again and again and again” on the Fox News Channel’s “America’s Election HQ” following the Democratic debate on Thursday.  Fournier said, [relevant remarks begin around 5:50] “Hillary Clinton did not sharpen her message. She’s still meandering all over the place. What does she really stand for? It’s hard to tell. And [Democratic presidential candidate Senator] Bernie Sanders ( ) for the love of God, how do you go through that debate and not mention the emails, not mention that the State Department IG went after the Clinton Foundation records?” Fournier added, after anchor Bret Baier said, “But if I’m moderating, you have to ask. ” “You would ask it again and again and again, as you should. It’s a very pertinent question. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
