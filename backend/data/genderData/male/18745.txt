On a special edition of Breitbart News Sunday, SiriusXM host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon will discuss Breitbart’s original reporting on the ground in two American cities whose stories are a microcosm of the issues confronting the electorate in 2016. [Breitbart’s Julia Hahn and Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle will report live from Janesville, Wisconsin, where Speaker Paul Ryan, whose globalist open borders and trade policies have made him a leader of the Republican wing of the permanent political class in DC, is facing a primary challenge from businessman Paul Nehlen, whose   message on trade and immigration echoes the issues animating the presidential race.  We’ll also hear from GOP strategist Ron Maxwell on the ground in Janesville. Breitbart’s Lee Stranahan will report on the ground from Twin Falls, Idaho, on the story of the horrific rape of a    girl by three Muslim migrant boys. Breitbart’s Michael Patrick Leahy and Pam Geller will also weigh in on this story that has focused national attention on the issue of Muslim migration and lack of assimilation. We’ll also hear from Pad Caddell on the latest polls. Breitbart News Sunday is broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 7PM to 10PM Eastern.
