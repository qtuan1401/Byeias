’  ’ ”   At the end of Tesla’s   earnings call on Wednesday,   CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the next vehicle headed our way   after the Model 3 will be a compact SUV called the Model Y. ” ’   Tesla has hinted at the upcoming Model Y for more than a year,   and Musk even included the  last month. ’ ’   But on Wednesday, Musk told analysts and members of the   media that Tesla will turn its attention to the Model Y after the   Model 3. ’ ”   Even though Tesla unveiled the prototype of the $35, 000     sedan in March, the production variant of the Model 3   likely won’t reach consumers until late 2018 at the earliest. ” ’   That means the compact SUV will likely not arrive before the end   of the decade. As a result, details on the car are slim. The   Model Y is expected to be built on the Model 3 platform and may   even spawn a pickup truck variant. ’ ’  ’ ’   Since Musk indicated that it is unlikely Tesla will build a car   cheaper than the Model 3, expect the 3 and the Y to have a   similar pricing relationship that the Model S sedan shares with   the Model X SUV. ’ ”   The Model X is generally priced a few thousand dollars more than   the corresponding trim level in the Model S lineup. The base   Model S 60 starts at $66, 000, while the   Model X 60D   starts at $74, 000. While the difference in dollar figures won’t   be as steep, the pricing correlation between the Model 3 and   Model Y will likely exist. ” ’   Musk also mentioned that the company is working on what the CEO   calls a ” .” It was also referenced in part two of the   ”Secret Master Plan.” But it is unclear if Musk is referring to a   commercial bus or a minivan in the realm of a Volkswagen   microbus. The Tesla CEO did say, however, that the ” ”   will be built on the Model X chassis. ’ ”   Finally, in case you haven’t noticed, with the addition of the   Model Y, Tesla’s lineup will consist of Model S, 3, X, and Y. ” ’   That’’s right. It spells ”SEXY.” ’ ’  ’
