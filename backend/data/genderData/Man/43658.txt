’  ’ ’   Wall Street has been abuzz at the prospect that, rather than just   raising interest rates to tighten monetary policy, the Federal   Reserve could actually forego a key crisis era policy related to   mortgages as well. ’ ’   In response to the worst housing downturn in modern US history,   the Fed bought billions worth of   securities in an   effort to thaw frozen credit markets. It has also maintained a   policy where, as those bonds mature, the principal amount is   reinvested in new   securities. ’ ’   A string of Fed officials  the central bank could halt   such reinvestments, something the Fed officially suggested it   might do once the process of raising interest rates was well   under way.  ’ ’   However, asked about the matter during Congressional testimony on   February 14, Janet Yellen showed a clear preference for not using   the balance sheet as a   tool.  ’ ’   ”The committee would like to the maximum extent possible to rely   on variations on our   rate,” Yellen said. ’ ’’ ’   She’s right. The whole point of using the balance sheet as an   active policy tool, even though its impact is less certain, was   that interest rates had already been brought down to zero as of   December 2008. ’ ”   Critics of the bond buying programs, known as quantitative easing   or QE, warned that it would lead to runaway inflation. They were   very wrong. Instead, inflation has struggled to even reach the   Fed’s 2% target, suggesting the labor market is still too weak to   push up wages significantly.  ” ’   When moving in the other direction, central bankers have the   privilege of relying on policy steps that give them greater   confidence. Why mess around? ’ ’Wall Street has been abuzz at the prospect. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
