Marc Randazza, a First Amendment lawyer based in Los Angeles, told The Wrap that if “Twitter [had] not banned Milo Yiannopoulos,” the release of nudes taken by the Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones to the internet on Wednesday “would not have happened. ”[From The Wrap:  “There’s zero chance that this wasn’t a fan of Milo’s (Yiannopoulos),”  [Randazza] said. “The other zero percent here is it’s zero percent Milo’s fault. ” Also a fat goose egg are the chances that Breitbart editor Yiannopoulos  —   who was recently suspended from Twitter for “targeted abuse” of Jones via the social media platform  —   will face any legal trouble over this ordeal, Randazza said. “If this was somebody who was a fan of Milo Yiannopoulos, unless he directed it, he has no liability at all,” Randazza continued. “If he just created a culture of it  —   as he has been accused in the past  —   that’s legally nothing. ” “Had Twitter not banned Milo Yiannopoulos, I bet it wouldn’t have happened,” he opined. After all, “This guy’s got millions of fans, so just do the numbers, man,” the revenge porn lawyer explained. “All you need is one out of 10 million to have the motivation to do this. Now, I’ll bet there was one in 100, 000 that had the motivation to do this   …     maybe one in 200, 000 had the motivation and the ability. ” You can read the rest of the article here.
