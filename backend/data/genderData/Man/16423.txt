CLEVELAND (AP)  —   Ben Roethlisberger threw three touchdown passes, Pittsburgh’s defense dominated and the Steelers slipped into the AFC playoffs with a   win over the Cleveland Browns, who are expected to fire coach Mike Pettine.  The Steelers ( ) had to win and needed Buffalo to knock off the New York Jets to make the postseason. Pittsburgh did its part despite a sloppy performance, and then earned a   berth when the Bills shocked the Jets   in Orchard Park, New York. Roethlisberger threw for 349 yards, 187 to the sensational Antonio Brown, who had 13 catches and a TD. The Browns ( ) ended another losing season in disarray and doubt. Owner Jimmy Haslam, who vowed in August that he wouldn’t “blow things up” will likely clean house, ousting Pettine and general manager Ray Farmer. Pettine went just   in two seasons, losing 18 of his final 21 games. ___, AP NFL website: www. pro32. ap. org and
