A series of disturbing video clips are emerging showing   activists replacing Israel’s flag with that of the state of Palestine at memorials commemorating those who died in the terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday. [In the first one (see above) a lady wearing a traditional Muslim headscarf was filmed by French television station RTL in Brussels’ Place de la Bourse, where an Israeli flag had been placed at a vigil to more than 30 victims of the bombings.  The woman appears to replace the Israel flag with a larger Palestinian flag, before tearing up the Israeli flag and hiding the pieces out of sight under a banner. Mourners have been placing flowers, candles and flags to show solidarity with the victims of the attack. In the second video a man takes a Palestinian flag and places it over the top of an Israeli flag at another memorial site. You can see that video below.  At no time is any attempt made by bystanders to remonstrate with either of the offenders.
