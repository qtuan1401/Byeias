 (CNN) The deadliest mass shooting in U. S. history has elicited a wave of support. Since the attack in Orlando at the Pulse nightclub during the early morning hours of June 12, people have been lining up to give blood.   ”It has been a tremendous outpouring of support throughout our service area,” Susan Forbes of local blood center OneBlood told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin.  ”They responded immediately and they replenished the blood supply in record time.” People wishing to give blood in the Orlando community are encouraged to make an appointment. OneBlood urges people in the U. S. to become regular blood donors to ensure a safe and available blood supply throughout the year. Another way to help the victims is through monetary donations. Equality Florida, a nonprofit LGBT civil rights organization, has set up a GoFundMe account for the victims and their families. Equality Florida spokesperson Ida Eskamani says all of the money donated will go to the families. The initial goal was $500, 000 which was met in just hours.  As of now, the goal is $7 million. ”We’ve gotten responses from folks all over the world,” says Eskamani.  The National Compassion Fund will equally distribute the money amongst the victims and their families for their long term needs, and now have an application for those affected to apply for aid. The fund is working closely with Equality Florida to combine efforts and ensure fair and transparent distribution of the donations received.  Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer announced the creation of the OneOrlando Fund in response to the Pulse tragedy.  This fund will focus on strengthening the Orlando community and helping it recover. The Council on   Relations (CAIR) put out a call to raise money through LaunchGood.  This fund will distribute their donations directly to the OneOrlando Fund.
