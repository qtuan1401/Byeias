Obama briefly resumed his answer, before stopping again after someone began asking for a doctor. Obama asked, “Can somebody help out, please, and get Doc Jackson in here?” During the incident, one of the reporters thanked the president for stopping, to which he replied, “Of course. ” He further asked people to give the reporter some room while they waited for the doctor to arrive.
