People devastated by the death of Harambe the Gorilla gathered at the Cincinnati Zoo to mourn after zoo authorities killed the animal when a child fell into the enclosure. [The roughly two dozen activists who attended the vigil spoke to media cameras and held signs remembering the loss of the gorilla outside the Cincinnati Zoo.  Signs held by the protestors read “All Animals Lives Matter,” “R. I. P Harambe,” “Taken Too Soon,” and “Senseless Death,” as a framed picture of the gorilla was set up as a makeshift memorial.
